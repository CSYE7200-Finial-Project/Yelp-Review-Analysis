mr hoagie is an institution walking in  it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago  old fashioned menu board  booths out of the 70s  and a large selection of food their speciality is the italian hoagie  and it is voted the best in the area year after year i usually order the burger  while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen  all of the other ingredients are very fresh overall  its a good alternative to subway  which is down the road
cold cheap beer good bar food good service   looking for a great pittsburgh style fish sandwich  this is the place to go the breading is light  fish is more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fries   good grilled chicken salads or steak  soup of day is homemade and lots of specials great place for lunch or bar snacks and beer
before i finally made it over to this range i heard the same thing from most people   its just fine to go work on your swing i had such a low expectation i was pleasantly surprised   its a fairly big range   if you are familiar with scallys in moon  it seems like it has almost as many tees  though its not nearly as nice a facility   the guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys ive come across at ranges or at courses yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for  and even some hazards to aim away from   a big red flag to me was the extra charge $3 to hit off the grass i am no range expert  but this is the 4th one ive been to and the first ive seen of that sort of nickel and diming  price for the golf balls was reasonable and i do plan to be back every week until they close up in october for the season hopefully  since its for sale  it will reopen as a golf facility again
i drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak  it re opens on july 14th and i cant wait to take my kids  the new range looks amazing  the entire range appears to be turf  which may or many not help your game  but it looks really nice  the tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something youll see on a newer course  cant wait to experience it
i visited this store several months ago to simply ask about smartphone plans the agent was pleasant and helpful i would recommend a visit to this store
this place was very good i found out about emils when watching a show called 25 things i love about pittsburgh on wqed hosted by rick seback this place aint a luxurious restaurantits a beer  a shot bar  lounge but the people are friendly  the food is good i had the fish sandwich which was great it aint in a great part of town  rankin  but ive been in worse places try this place
wonderful reuben  map shown on yelp page is incorrect it is actually a different hawkins  id recommend a call for directions 412 271 9911
this is a hidden gem  no really it took us forever to find but well worth it it is right across the street from the rankin police station the menu has a wide selection  i really couldnt decide what i wanted but i went with the ribeye sandwich im glad i did too huge sandwich i added mushrooms  it was very flavorful my boyfriend got the fish sandwich  he enjoyed it as well fast and friendly service will definitely be back
another divey place we have been going to for years my dads favorite  as he knows the original owners certain items on the menu are named after the kids huge portions  might have a bit of a wait some nights huge burgers  fish sandwiches  salads decent service
love my hometown favorites cannot beat their fish sandwiches although i do miss the buns as opposed to the sliced breadstop that always will support emils other favorites include reuben  hawkins avenue sandwich  chrissy club
this would be my local haunt  if i were ever to relocate to the pittsburgh area what a great little place such friendly staff  and some damn good eats   it was so great  that we actually went there twice during our 4 day vacation to catch the steelersravens game   they have daily sandwich specials on thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand  and the 35 cent wings very  very tasty im sorry  but this place kicks primanti bros butt on the taste factor they have about 8 different types of wings reg  garlic  and i cant remember the rest   we got the regular  and i was wishing we would had ordered more  going back on a friday night  we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n mushroom  wow that buffalo chicken pizza was awesome  the other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers an older gentleman; he seemed to be a regular i really  really wanted his spam t shirt
a great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele i went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one friday night and it didnt disappoint it is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you   im guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans  young men in collared shirts  and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place   the staff was top notch   the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short staffed for the night  but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit the other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan  and i wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing  we ordered a white pizza   large in size  engulfed in cheese  full of garlic flavor  flavorful hot sausage an overall delicious pizza  aside from 2 things: 1  way too much grease i know this comes with the territory  but still  it is sometimes unbearable; 2  canned mushrooms   the worst thing to come out of a can ever i would rather eat canned alpo than canned mushrooms and if the mushrooms werent canned  they were just the worst mushrooms ive ever consumed the mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star   disgusting  my advice for the place is keep everything awesome   random music from the jukebox  tasty food  great prices  good crowd and staff   and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap  ill never know
alexions has been around forever  the first time i went in there  i was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill  all of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work  and i immediately found out why  many  many years later  i stopped in there with some fond memories  and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer  even though they didnt know who i was  the sandwiches are done pittsburgh style  sort of like primantis  and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when i first started visiting the place  alexions is a clean and peaceful little place in the rook station part of green tree  the oldest part of the town  i recall that some of the sandwiches i got there were ordered at a pretty late hour  nothing but good things to say about the place  and i wish it was closer to home
what a cool barrestaurant i will no doubt be visiting again  the service and prices were great and the restrooms were clean   i had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious  the menu consists of typical bar food food  however; theres a few different items on there which stand out on the menu  a cool bar off the beaten path that is a worth a trip    cheers  
perfect joint dont be afraid as you pull up its a nice little neighborhood was in town on biz and my hotel was right up the street great service  well apportioned servings and unique menu make this place worthy of a check in
contrary to other reviews  i have zero complaints about the service or the prices i have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now  and compared to my experience with places like pep boys  these guys are experienced and know what theyre doing  also  this is one place that i do not feel like i am being taken advantage of  just because of my gender other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars  and have sucked my bank account dry but here  my service and road coverage has all been well explained   and let up to me to decide  and they just renovated the waiting room it looks a lot better than it did in previous years
i took my wifes car in for new tires on good friday i felt that the prices were reasonable  i didnt feel pressured to buy the most expensive tire  and i was out in less than 2 hours with no appointment
most random location for a mini golf course ever  this is old school its built into the woods spray yourself for bugs first right off forsythe rd near carnegie park  the candy hut is fun to spend your spare change  they recently re carpeted the holes and added a few gimmicks that werent there before  it wont knock your socks off  but if youre local  give it a try
this quaint mini golf course is one of the oldest  yet most original and fun locations that i have yet visited  coming from texas  it was nice to see a course located amongst the hilly and woody pennsylvanian terrain it can be frustrating that it is literally impossible to make a hole in one on most every hole and that the course also makes it extremely difficult to predict the direction on how the ball will follow through and bounce  the cartoon like outrageousness of the course proved to give laughs and a fun attempt to play  improvements were being made and i will look forward to returning on my next visit to the pittsburgh area  i enjoy traveling and visiting new courses and the only reason why i didnt give this location 5 stars is because it was impossible to intuitively shoot the ball for a best effort to beat par
i think this place is closed their number is out of service  sign is gone and the course has not been maintained awesome woodsy mess of a course though
ive been informed by a fellow yelper that they are just closed for the season  i hope theyre right i find it strange they dont keep their phone number in service with a recording and that they didnt cover the course up to protect it from weather  vandalism  etc either way  i cant wait to get my game on in the spring
when i wanted a deck for the back of my home i ended up calling quaker state construction it ended up working very well and they were very polite i got an estimate and called them to start working out the details of my new deck once we got the plans all sorted out they started building my new deck and it was finished with in a reasonable amount of time i now have a beautiful deck that i can relax and that my family can enjoy overall  they did a good job and i would use them in the future for all my deck necessities
nice  suppose to be haunted in carnegie off main st closed sunday during summer during school season open some nights until 7pm
awesome historic building high on top of the hill in carnegie home to stage 62  a theatre group that puts on musicals i recently saw sideshow and evita here great sound and comfortable chairs  an all around pleasant experience for a pleasant evening or sunday matinee plenty of free parking and at only 18 dollars its a true bargain   and yes  the rumors are true  this building is haunted
ive pretty much been eating at various kings pretty regularly since i was a child when my parents would take my sister and i into the fox chapel location often  lately me and my girl have been visiting the heidelburg location i love the food  it really tastes homemade  much like something a grandmother would make  complete with gobs of butter and side dishes prices are low  selection is great  but dont expect fine dining by any means   service is hit or miss at pretty much all of them; if you have lunch at any kings  you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game seek out this lady  my experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same  im in my 30s now  and very little has changed  other than the fox chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look less like a diner  which was a big fail  any girl i meet has to enjoy kings or shes out
i heart kings ive always been a fan and this one was as good as my old one in monaca
i arrived around 10 am on a saturday morning  i was greeted by the hostess who was polite and friendly  and i informed her that i was alone  she had just arrived  as well  and wasnt exactly sure what was going on yet  so she asked the manager? where she should seat me  after receiving guidance  she brought me to a table towards the back  it had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined  so  she quickly got it cleared off  grabbed a rag  and wiped it down  the waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order  she was extremely friendly  i ordered coffee and water  which she went and got while i looked over the menu  she returned  and took my order  i ordered the cinnamon swirl french toast special   three slices of french toast made with pittsburghs own jenny lee cinnamon swirl  two farm fresh eggs  with bacon or sausage i chose sausage  and your choice of potato i went with the cheesy hash brown casserole  i also added an orange juice  she went and put my order in  while i waited  and came back with it after not too long   the eggs were cooked exactly how i wanted them  the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious  i also enjoyed the sausage which was pretty typical  kings family restaurant featured a very friendly staff  great prices  and tasty food  i am pleased and will definitely come back again
rockys has been in business since the 1980s and still going strong  their food is good  not haute cuisine  pretentious  everyday  well prepared and taste bud pleasing home style cooking  ive mostly gone during supper hours and  and ate in the dining room  but  today i introduced an old friend to linner in the bar he ordered the large version of fish sandwich  rockys is famous for their fish  three large breaded and fried fish filets  bun and fries for under $10  needless to say  he had no complaints and brought home more than he ate i ordered the meatball grill  it was delish  served on thick cut italian bread and made grilled cheese mozzarella style  meatballs and tomato sauce are both good  also  served with fries  i brought home half the sandwich another good meal there  friends  mother  and former boss all enjoy their food
great local bar theresa does a great job sandwiches are excellent recommend meatball  reuben  burger  fish sandwiches
good luck getting a seat  thats all i have to say the gab and eat is famous and infamous diner food is whats up and i like it when i was a roofing mechanic  wed meet there before work although im not sure i would recommend it if youre working were theres no bathrooms hehe
the biggest breakfast in pittsburgh  as far as i can tell   and delicious and cheap too i ordered some mix of eggs  bacon and pancakes   and got 2 dinner sized plates  one loaded with pancakes and the other stuffed with eggs  bacon  and home fries oh  and a side of toast for under $5  if i recall  huge portions  all well executed; as good as delucas  ive not had anything besides breakfast  so cant comment on the burger or anything else  cramped quarters  and youll have to wait  but when nothing but monster morning food will do  this is the destination
i miss this place when i return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before when i think of pittsburgh  i remember cutting morning classes in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner  and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint go here and you will be happy you did
definitely a greasy spoon always packed here and always a wait but worth it the omelets are really tastey especially with their homemade sausage i also like the mixed grill  my parents love their burgers took off a star for lumpy booths and really tight tables your arm gets hit when someone walks past oh and waitresses arent very attentive
if youre looking for no frills but a great breakfast this is the place i got the mixed grill half portion and was very full make sure you have extra calories for the day because they are not afraid to use butter loved the breakfast and would go back not much room for sitting down but worth the wait
great homemade hot breakfast sausage and a wonderful family restaurant feel   reminds me of the one my parents used to own in mi   have fun finding a table on the weekend :
yum   freaking   me  as the other fellower yelpers mentioned   this place is a cash only    a couple of recommendations:    dont eat early in the week    i dont recommend wearing any tight clothing no skinny jeans   you will not be skinny when you leave    i walked in for breakfast one early weekday am   the place was packed with locals and regulars    a very good sign  my co worker recommended i get the mixed grill   i ordered the large mix grill   my waitress tried to warn me   it is large very large    i ended up eating the left overs for the next 2 days  food     the mixed grill comprises their homemade sausage  grilled onions  grilled peppers  potatoes  fried eggs       portion    this should have been a man vs food episode   i was not going to attempt to eat all the food   it was really good  service     my waitress looks as if she had been working there for years   she was fast  friendly  and offered good advice  price     the cost ranges $5   10   i will definitely go back after i buy some new stretchy pants
great breakfast  good price you might have to stand outside in line though  so i dont really recommend winter time to go lol very friendly service  interesting coffee mugs they have great deserts and such also bring your cash though as they dont take cards
met my nephew for lunch in carnegie and he suggested gab  eat   way to go justin  the restaurant is in a strip mall across from the dairy queen  the grill is right up front so you can see them cooking   they have counter space for eating and tablesbooths for 4   dont expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4 they have a great looking breakfast menu   we all got burgers of varying kinds  they were tasty   the buns were buttered  toasted and soft  yum   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door   we ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings  both of which were great  the half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order   the restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign  i give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws  silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter  at least she didnt throw the food when it came   she also served the fries and onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird   they were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers   it didnt factor into my four star rating but i deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay   just kidding justin   love ya
sadly  i have only been here twice  only due to the fact it is not really close to my home or work however  when i am in the area  this is a great cheap eats for both lunch and breakfast its almost like going back in time to where the old style local diners or isalys to get made to order diner style food love the eggs made perfectly to order and a variety of lunch offering at extremely affordable prices i only wish gab  eat would move to my neighborhood
great diner some of the best breakfast sausage ive ever had my wife didnt like how her omelet was prepared it appeared they just took scrambled eggs and folded the omelet ingredients in the middle but everything else was great including my sons pancake
my friend and i stopped in yesterday for breakfast we originally came to carnegie to eat at another new breakfast spot  but they had an hour wait and we had some retail therapy to handle stat gab  eat crossed my mind since i had bookmarked it on yelp over 2 years ago   there was a tiny wait here about 2 couples in front of us finally 2 seats at the bar opened up and we decided to eat there  surprisingly we both ordered the same thing mixed grill mine had sausage links and she decided on bacon   it was a blast watching all the food being made right before our eyes giant club sandwiches  super thick pancakes  eggs eggs and more eggs it was a fun time   the restaurant is literally a hole in the wall but had good customer service and delicious food   my only complaint is that i ordered my mixed grill with cheese i thought it was going to be shredded cheddar  but they put 3 slices of american on it eh ill know better next time
great value  close drive to city  not much to do around hotel  its a business park carnegie city has a few bars and restaurants
simple rustic local wait that is every gordon ramsey review  my experience at extended stay america was great the staff was warm and friendly and made it a point to speak to me every morning as i left and when i returned in the evening they went out of their way to provide a confirmation and point me in the direction of restaurants and nightspots when needed   if i ever need to utilize an extended stay hotel i wouldnt hesitate to head back there
ive stayed at a couple of extended stay sites that i found quite satisfactory and this location proved to be just as good excellent place to stay while visiting pittsburgh it is just a five minute drive to downtown location is in a business park area so it is quiet   the rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator  sink  cabinets and two burners there is no oven which i expected as the descriptions all state full kitchen so be aware of that also they do not keep the dishes  pots and pans  coffee makers  toasters or utensils in the rooms if you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in   the room was clean and well maintained cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable the free wifi is usually fast   the best part about this location was the staff the people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile  i would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it
be warned dont expect the best service ever its not the cleanest place youve been in either the decor is soccer jerseys from places and teams youve probably never heard of its divey  eclectic  and authentic   if youre looking for good irish food and a cold pint  you cant go wrong at the pour house like most of carnegies main st  this is a hidden gem worth seeking out they have some of the best irish food ive had in pittsburgh  the colcannon is awesome and the shepherds pie is out of this world if youre not looking for irish food  then try the grilled cheese  and make sure you ask it with the three cheeses together its big and the cheese is thick and gooey i get it with a side of potato pancakes yum   also  they have guinness  smithwicks and harp on tap
best irish food in the burgh  great bar food too  the service is maybe a bit surly and its not the cleanest  nor the best decor  but  thats not what this place is about  its a town irish bar and it serves great solid irish fare and suds to the locals  and it does it better than anyone  i go back again and again
recommended 16 inch pizza on special was cheap fast service not the best pizza but above average
having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important  i try to keep it as local as possible  so when i heard about a tailor in carnegie i was intrigued  the building is in a strip mall across from carnegie coffee company  unassuming  looks like it is closed all the time  until you do a drive by and see the hours posted  there is a latino man in his 20s working when you arrive  in my mind  i imagine a tailor to be older  kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck textbook movie tailor  so i was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing  he asks you to go change into a closet yes  a closet to change in with one lightbulb but all my worries aside  the moment he started working on my items i knew he was the real deal he learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew and he does things the correct way  meaning  for example   i took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff  but he seamed them up to look exactly the way they were when i first bought them  most placed will have bulges and puckers  the rest of my items were just as perfect  very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem  the items were done in a timely manner  he takes his business very seriously  while i was there  i watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour  and he did it and charged the same price  really nice guy  please go and support this business to keep him around town
i love ljs and have to agree  service was decent here i tried a piece of my kids chicken i only ever get the fish for myself and was pleasantly surprised to find white breast meat same chicken texture as chick fil a a little grimy dining room  and the bathroom handle is broken 82015 it would be nice if they made it an aw ljs but as is still works for me
when i moved to the area  dr weinberg was recommended to me by my cousin who had been a client for years ive had nothing but positive experiences with her and her staff since seeing her two years ago the team is professional  nice and courteous i recently had to reschedule an appointment due to a last minute work thing and they were very accommodating my daughter looks forward to coming to the dentist so thats saying something i do wish they would turn off fox news in the lobby as id rather watch paint dry but nobodys perfect
my family husband and 3 young children have been seeing dr weinberg for a few years weve never had an issue shes great with the kids  even my 6 year old who has autism scheduling and rescheduling appts is fine  the wait time is fine  the care is find basically i have had no issues  but i havent had my socks blown off either its the dentist  it is what it is
don don is atleast as good as although i personally  happen to think better than the majority of  inexpensive chinese places best equiped for  delivery and take out  ive frequented many  similar establishments in different parts of the country  and have also spent a few years in japan   sounds odd  but they have some amazing chinese  food out there
delicious singapore noodles and seafood delight crispy flavorful crab rangoon  and cold sesame noodles done well but couldve used a bit more sauce excellent real chinese food  friendly service  restaurant ambience: high school cheap date quality
went for breakfast on 61614 we received very good service and meal came within a few minuteswaitress could have smiled more but was friendly  i had a grand slam it was more than enough food  meal was very tasty we will definitely go back  it is a popular dennys
chose dennys for a very late 1:30pm sunday brunch no wait quickly greeted and served i ordered the half size of moon over my hammy it was just the right amount of food for me  and the hash browns were delicious only thing lacking was franks red hot :  son and husband very pleased with their meals  cant remember the names but see pic patron next to us gave us $5 off $20 check  so our total came to $16 would go back again for a casual meal
i belong to this gym  i live in the south section of pittsburgh  and i find that this gym is not too far from me  the staff is friendly  the equipment is quite good  you get two free personal training sessions when you join  they have lots of weights which my boyfriend uses and a decent cardio room  the only thing i would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment  water is only $1 a bottle
i really like this gym it is nice neighborhood gym and unlike big gyms they dont have big contracts and they have flexible memberships great selection of classes all the instructors are very good knowledgable and motivating all the staff working there are super nice their selection of the equipment is good too 
this is one of my husbands fave restaurants in town my husband generally orders chicken parm  which is very good their sauce is quite good they serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping   yum   i generally order one of their house salads think it has a specific name  but cant recall off the top of my head which has mixed greens and i get it with blue cheese  pine nuts and their yummy vinaigrette a tad pricey for a salad thats just lettuce and cheese i want to say about $8 with the extras  but really good especially with some cracked black peeper i tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the greens  beans   the place has sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side it has a comfortable feeling it also has a solid wine by the glass selection   better than a lot of places in the burgh   unfortunately  weve never had dessert there bc we get so full of bread and dinner
thanks yelpers for this find the service  the plating  the ambiance were wonderful i had the eggplant parmigiana and it was good   but different it was thinly sliced like deli meat and wasnt breaded  it was fried in a very light batter
i went there for dinner last night with a client  this is second time i visited  i had a scotch and he had a guiness  the  1 is for drink selection just stock some better beers and higher end scotch and youre five stars  we started with the meatballs covered with provolone and other blessed goodness  these did not disappoint  i had a four cheese pizza with sweet sausage and garlic  it was fantastic  they have so many good dishes  but i wanted the pizza last night  i couldnt finish the pizza   way to go big medium pizza  i finished up with a coffee  the parking can be a bit of a challenge on the street  but its a small town atmosphere in carnegie  pa  i love the downtown there
yay  im a fan but sometimes service is a little slow  it was very good for us this visit  go to papa js every once in a while but mostly for the white pizza  it is the best white pizza i have ever had  order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend it has garlic  spinach  feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top  it was delicious  order fried calamari and it was oknote to self next time try the calamari roman style  like the dinning room with the hardwood floors and bright lighting    the bar was jumping thou never go to the bar
yay  im a fan of the white pizza  had take out    the bar was jumping when i picked up our order  the white pizza is so deliciouswith garlic  spinach  feta  and added some veggies  tried the roman style calamari  very good better than the fried calamari we had last time
we met our good friends from morgantown here for lunch today and were really impressed with the place itself and the menu   i had read a few of the reviews ahead of time and the pizza was mentioned more than once so by the time we got there  i was jonesing for it   it certainly delivered the crust was great  the sauce wast too sweet and the toppings were sufficient   our friend for the baby clams with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bit   as good as the pizza was  this was _much_ better   well return again to this beautifully lit gem in carnegie pa soon
ok  its friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat driving by papa js and w says  lets stop in and get a quick dinner   advice host that we are in a hurry  the host advised us it is a 90 minute service the place was crowded  we were seated at the last open table however our waiter  jason  said he will do his best to get as out on time we ordered our dinner immediately  with a salad and a glass of wine in a few minutes we had our wine  then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving for dipping  yum  just as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered great job jason the fettuccine carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta  in and out in 60 minutes  now that is some good service
great little gem the food was fantastic was very food and just the right price the italian food was amazing  but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepared for giant serving i had the carrot cake yummy def a place everyone should try
this is a regular go to for me i love the food and the service they always have the wine that i like and the food is always delicious i suggest trying the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store in the section where you can buy stuff to take home it is sublime and makes you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness
i thought the interiors were very nice  we stopped here on a friday night  i was glad they werent busy because nothing else in the area looked appetizing    my daughter  i split a chicken parm sandwich  which was really good instead of it being served on a hoagie  it was served on thin bread  like focaccia or something  it was pretty good  little messy  the desserts looked amazing  i thought it was pretty cool how you can watch the cooks prepare the food from outside  the kitchen is situated on a corner with lots of windows  i would return
san francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great i am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area i liked carnegie because u can stroll down main street and hit a couple places for lunch i imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night we ate a lunchtime and it was nice
great place for dinner  drinks or a small celebration  papa js is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we dont have reservations and want a nice dinner out my husband and i have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed i assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy i have been proved wrong  we are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes unfortunately  the alternate barlounge area isnt always open i really dont understand why more people dont go here  my favorites are the fried zucchini  wedding soup and pizzathe zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well the wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery my husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce also  their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table   also  if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event  consider papa js they have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties we had our rehersal dinner for our wedding here and everyone loved the food
very good restaurant with very good food at a pretty reasonable price  we had a birthday dinner here with seven girlfriends the waitress was very efficient   but not very friendly our orders came out hot and excellently prepared  try the tilapia milanese   its excellent best steamed broccoli ive ever had
i was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant  came here with no expectations    i was greeted by a large open garage style window  that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street  it had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly  ordered the quattro formaggi pizza  quite good  great balance of cheeses  not too rich at all  crust was excellent too  cant wait to come back
just to start off  we were a party of 12  which is always a little difficult  we were celebrating 2 birthdays  we loved the food  it was delicious my husband got a chicken parm sandwich  which is served on a yummy flat bread  and i got the chicken basil pizza  i got an 8 cut and several ppl tried it we all loved it it was stunning  it was made with a very delicious crust  nice and crisp  not soggy like pesto pizza can get  the one waitress we had jasmine  was fantastic  she was bright  friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu  she took extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections   now the other waitress mary something was so incompetent  she was awful and rude  she missed 2 people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said well they didnt speak up ugh  then when it was time to sing and cut the cake  my sister in law said oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing?  she came back  cut the cake all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake and we didnt even sing  we were mad  the place is so pretty  they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years according to my father in law and its really nice  they look to have a cool bar area with some modern couches and a really sweet look     so good food  great looking place one bad waitress prices are about middle of the road for an authentic italian place  nothing crazy  all in all  wed like to go back again  but we want jasmine
i am amazed that people can write negative reviews about papa js   i have been a return customer since the early 90s and the food quality  and service  are way above averageand especially for this price range  kudos to management for maintaining such a level of quality and freshness   nothing we had tonight was disappointing  and we over ordered because each dish was delectable  the best item tonight was the mozzarella appetizer cradled in bread with an authentic marinara  the white pizza with sun dried tomatoes was  as usual  out of this world good   the scallops special appetizer was phenomenal  we will be back
the menu has lots of choices and the food is great the resturante has been expanded so its pretty large the new section has door that they leave open during nice weather which makes for a nice ambience the bread is great and fresh baked daily
spinachfeta cheese salad:  b  pesto alfredo penne :  :a  coconut cake huge piece:  a  bread small portions:  b service b  host seemed grumpy  waitress good  but then she got busy  price: pasta was $15 and the portion smallish more like a $1299 dish  arrive early on saturday night this place packed after 6pm
many trips to pittsburgh over 20 years  first time here  had the gnocchi special  one of the best gnocchi i have ever had  pizza was excellent  service was great
did dinner with my gf last saturday at papa js prior to going to the off the wall theater this was the first time weve been to this restaurant we usually stop a rileys pour house across the street for a bite before seeing a show in this town but today we decided to shake it up and do something different  the place is deceptively larger than it looks from the outside it was also busier than we would have expected on this particular evening and we got one of the remaining tables which was located near the entrance and the bar the traffic from both the customers and the staff that flowed past us was a little noisy and distracting and we could tell thats why it was one of the last tables available but our waitress came by promptly  got us drinks i had a hoegaarden and my girl ordered an absolute water and cranberry  gave us menus and recited the specials of the day  after viewing the menu for a bit  i decided on the veal parmigiano; my date went with one of the specials  a chicken and broccoli gnocchi dish the plates took about 15 minutes to arrive and the portions were humongous enough for a filling lunch the next day my veal was tender and delicious but its really the gnocchi that left the biggest impression you could tell that it was house made; it was like little fluffy pillows dissolving in your mouth with each bite i never tasted gnocchi like it before  over all i give papa js a big thumbs up the food was good  most of the dinning areas seemed cozy  the building itself has a certain charm with its high ceiling and the tables draped in white table cloths give it a pristine appearance although i thought it was a bit pricy  i didnt feel as if ive been taken  other than the location of our table  it was the pre theater perfect meal i only hope get a more intimate table next time we stop for dinner
a unique and great find in downtown carnegie my fiance and i came here for a weekend lunch and wanted something different from our usual weekend spots we had the sausage stuffed pepperoncinis as an appetizer these are never my favorite and were just ok  but the marinara served with them was very tasty  as was their homemade bread  i had a really great wood fired meatball ricotta pizza and fiance had the chicken parm sandwich our waiter was very attentive and friendly i ordered a cannoli on the way out the door and it was fantastic not overly sweet  crunchy chocolate dipped shell stuffed with thick cream and mini chocolate chips amazing we will definitely be back here
i gave them 4 stars for two reasons   1 they do not have fresh pasta and 2 my boyfriends chicken abruzzo was dry the service was attentive and the bread was amazing my carbonara was incredible the main dining room was a nice grotto style reminiscent of rome; nice for couples and girlfriends catching up on life i loved the montpluciano in a carafe  but dont miss the extensive italian wine list we will definitely return to this carnegie gem
we recently decided to celebrate our anniversary at papa js there is a parking lot in the back of the building and the entrance is on the side the food was perfectly prepared  served at the proper temperature  and was quite delicious portion sizes were quite satisfying the complimentary bread and oil was excellent the service was polite and efficient
i judge a pizza joint by their cheese pizza and their pepperoni  while grabbing a brew at voodoo  my friends and i were feeling a bit hungry  thankfully a menu was available and capri pizza was just across the street   we ordered a small cheese pizza to pick up  i was pleasantly surprised  the cheese was not greasy  the sauce was flavorful  and the dough was chewy yet crunchy what more could you ask for?  we were really impressed with the quality cheesy pizza from capri  next time well try the pepperoni and post an update  i see yummy pizza in our future  if youre grabbing a pint a voodoo and feel a rumbly in your tumbly  order something cheesy at capri pizza in homestead
regarding quality of beverage  this is just your average starbucks i cant complain but am not blown away either however  i really like the location of this shop  which is located in the center of the waterfronts specialty retail shops though in the midst of a lot of retail  the surrounding area is very picturesque with pretty green grass  flowers  and a fountain hanging out here is very relaxing
i love the location of this starbucks  which is why im giving it 4 stars its right smack in the middle of clothing stores  the loews movie theater  as well as restaurants i love grabbing a mid afternoon latte here on a saturday while perusing various stores such as the gap or loft i also like coming here before or after a movie for a quick caffeine jolt  while the drinks are the same as you would find at any starbucks  the baristas and staff are really friendly  perhaps more so than other area starbucks   my drink or choice when i come here generally in the mod afternoon is a venti or trenta berry hibiscus refresher yum it is the perfect afternoon pick me up that leaves me feeling refreshed and hydrated
oprah chai latte great central spot in this out door mall staff was pretty efficient and fast
very friendly local dive bar there is nothing special going on here but friendly folks and cold beer this is exactly the kind of place i like to hang out in
this is smaller store than ones ive seen inside malls  but they seem to have all of the necessities they have a great collection of candles my favorites were in the relax section turquoise sky  home sweet home were great im not a huge fan of food scented candles  but they actually had very nice ones apple pumpkin was great and surprisingly i loveddddd christmas cookie the employees were all helpful
whenever i was at the waterfront i would eat here  the shakes are good  as are the shoestring fries and baked beans  the sandwiches are small thin patties of meat so you probably want at least a double  overall  pretty tasty
the food is good and its cheap  i mean really inexpensive  $400 for a burger and fries add a coke and its like $1000 $1300 for two people  seldom if ever crowded   service can be a tad slow but hit or miss  they also do breakfast and its a great alternative to waiting at eat and park  try the shakes  theyre great
i heart steak n shake i love the fact that the fries are shoestring  the burgers get to you pretty fast  theyre a little greasy  and the food is super cheap  i visited steak and shake on new years eve in preparation for an evening of mostly tame partying i was unnaturally attracted to their wisconsin buttery burger  which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onions between two buns that have been buttered sounds good right?  well  i get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns had been dunked in butter the pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me  i took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burgerfries seasoning on the buns and i literally got tears in my eyesmost likely from the salt overload  but possibly because this was one of the most evilly decadent things i had eaten in a long time  this is not meant to be a fine dining experience service wasnt fast but it wasnt slow it just kind of was however  the waitress did get a point for explaining that the order would take x amount of time to all patrons so i give them a pass for being upfront about it  next trip to pgh is going to feature steak and shake   i guarantee it
fast food in a resturant setting  considering this food is good and cheap plus you can get food to go  must be a reason why this place is always packed
i never thought that id be giving steak n shake a 4 star review  but i really enjoyed my dinner here tonight it just hit the spot  i was impressed by our waiter as soon as we walked through the door he apologized for our very brief wait to be seated and for the fact that he was the only waiter working at that time however  everything was delivered promptly  and he made what wouldve been just a tasty diner dinner into a great experience  i ordered a grilled cheese and fries the grilled cheese was well cooked and filled with tasty  perfectly melty cheese i love steak n shakes thin and crispy fries  and these were as delicious as i had expected  for just $9 for me and my husband  i have to admit that we had forgotten how inexpensive steak n shake was based on the cost  the food  and our fantastic waiter  well be back soon
fell asleep last night before i did my review what i can say about this place is their food is good their milkshakes r awesome i had gotten the chicken fingers with fries  a birthday cake milkshake which was delish we got seated pretty fast  our waiter was very polite  professional
as far as im concerned  filenes basement is good for two things: cheap dresses and cheap accessoriesr r as a young performer  i need good looking dresses for frequent auditions   and i need a couple  so im not wearing the same thing every time the dresses on the second floor usually range from $30 60 and are good for over a year it can be hard to find a full length dress thats not reminiscent of a prom dress  but their selection of cocktail length dresses is ampler r as far as accessories go  filenes tends to have cheap versions of popular trends if i feel the need to stock my wardrobe with a transient fad  filenes is the place to go
even when we didnt have a car filenes basement was worth the bus trip to the waterfront i always find something usually i find 3 4 things and spend about $60 and better still  i am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later   i kind of suspect this is the best shopping in pittsburgh; its much better than the usual department stores  better than marshalls and tj maxx and better than the saks downtown  even when it has a sale selection  bargains and quality  i like this filenes better than gabriel brothers  which are harder to get to gabriel brothers are a real discount shoppers challenge and im afraid i didnt live in pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills    filenes was still up and running in june 2007 when i left town
this is probably my favorite store in pittsburgh  for the selection and variety of discounted designer clothing other stores carry the same stuff but for much  much more  and its hard to find all the stuff that the basement carries in one spot yes  i admit that the burgh has some cool stores i would do most of my clothes shopping here if i were here more often
well  the experience did not start well when we walked in the singing we heard was not good oy was it not good thankfully  it mostly improved from there  so there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis so each was on for an hour and off for half of the 3  two were really good good singers  good piano players  and very funny the third guy  well  not so much piano skills were fine but his singing was not when he sang in his range  he wasnt too bad actually  but too often he reached for notes that he couldnt get to or forced things that just werent going to happen often his jokes fell completely flat luckily the other two usually did most the talking  they played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested closer by nin as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight we requested britney spears toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it  it turned out really good that takes some serious talent to pull off if they didnt know it like toxic theyd find it and play it they played a wide variety of stuff  part of the experience is based on the crowd we had a couple larger groups there on a thursday night  so smallish group in general that they interacted with a lot  providing some running jokes and comedy of course  that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show  my friends were big fans of the super cheap beer specials $1 drafts from rock bottom next door the waitress wasnt great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isnt that easy to navigate the bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast  if in the waterfront for a night out  definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songsjokes having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun
while we were in pittsburgh for the winter classic on new years day  we figured wed see what the area had to offer for nye my wife and i  along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up sing sing in homestead its apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area when it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development the only remaining artifacts from what once was  were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance pretty cool  sing sing  which is a piano bar  is attached to the rock bottom brewery and serves a selection of rbbs in house brews and shares a similar menu there are no tvs  no sports memorabilia which is rare for this city  and no big booths for large groups this place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians mind you this isnt a bad thing  just note that if you want a bar  go next door or across the street to dave and busters id say sing sing holds about 150 people seated  this particular night they were hosting a shocker nyes party for $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken  veggies  mashed potatoes  one free drink coupon  a midnight champagne toast  and  what turned out to be over four hours of non stop music again pretty cool  there were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano drums  electric synth  bass guitar  and apparently i missed the sax there was plenty of crowd involvement as in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip the larger the tip  the better chance of hearing your song you have i put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played their rendition of totos africa was fantastic and surprisingly  my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the theme from tvs growing pains i was sold from that point on  i will take this time to note that this is not a family friendly joint im not sure if it was 21  only but i certainly wouldnt bring anyone too young to drive a good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you  drinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced i think rail mixed drinks were $700 and beers were 6 or so rbb doesnt brew anything i particularly enjoy so i stuck with rum and cokes all and all my bill wasnt scary and im not used to that on dec 31st waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive no complaints there   the only down side to everything was group seating as youre sitting at 2 top cab tables it was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back allowing us to talk and share foodbooze etc  also  being a tourist  we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in homestead understandably nye has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 25 hours for a cab because  as we found out  homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives   ooops  all and all a good time and someplace id certainly return to if for any reason id be back in pittsburgh as long as i have a car
somuchfun   i wish i could play a song at the drop of a hat too bad i never took piano lessons and id probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus unless its salt n pepas shoop   this is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out its just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a saturday night   keep in mind youll be paying around a $5 10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get the good thing is the food is coming from the attached rock bottom brewery so a lot of it is restaurant quality good plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good of course you will be paying restaurant price drinksso of course theyre up charged a bit but you do pay for the whole experienceso you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits   the guys who play are incredibly talented theres 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano they pretty much play anything you ask contemporary songs  throw back songs  fight songs  rap songs  pop songs you name it  they play it   my favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys theyll all four get on stage and play two pianos  a guitar and drums they usually rock out with some fun familiar songs um  journey  of course   the birthday song is seriously the best they sing to youand call you some nameswith expletives but in a totally nice way of course you just have to go
had an absolute blast great for any crowd  any occasion  any age ashley the waitress was amazing
picture billy joels piano man doubled mixed with beer  a rowdy crowd  and comedy   welcome to sing sing  a unique musical experience found in homestead  if youre looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer  come on in  serving food and brews from rock bottom brewery  sing sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two or more amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests  theyll play anything youd like  for tips of course  wanting to hear britney spears?  toto?  duran duran?  yep  they play that new or old  the crowd makes the show  so make sure you come ready for a good time  if the crowd is dead  its harder for the guys to get a reaction  if youre wanting to have some fun  it can be a great time  its the perfect place for birthday parties   especially if you want to embarrass a friend  the guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty  for being a good sport  you get the coveted sing sing bumper sticker  now who wouldnt want that?  dueling pianos and brews time to shut up  sing sing
first time here tonight and i must say i wasnt sure if i wanted to go it seemed like it might be ok but nothing special but i decided to go with friends and man did i have a blast the $7 door charge was great figuring u had music from 8 until probably 2 am  we left shortly after 1 the food was not super but good prices reasonable the beer left something to b desired as they r a micro brewery so u can only get their crafts i asked for something similar to yeungling but what i got was nothing like it the musicians were great they made this place awesome we will b back and this may b our new pittsburgh hangout
my friend is a piano teacher  so i took it as a good sign that sing sing would be quality stuff it was her birthday  and i didnt really know anything about dueling piano bars i was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes  pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine i am really  really glad i was wrong   it was gritty  bawdy and quintessentially pittsburgh first off  the pianos are scuffed to hell  considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated the musicians hammer away at them  and theyre covered with n and sing sing stickers its obvious theyve been well loved the music is anything but the elevator music i was picturing; its rock  hip hop  oldies  pop  and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system send up a piece of paper with some money and the amazing repertoire of the musicians for instance  rubber ducky and gangstas paradise were both featured when i was there  and both performed impeccably they also honored a request for a taylor swift song only to receive $30 and a request for anything else  which they promptly followed the musicians also do funny versions of popular songs  and throw in things like yinz instead of you  i saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night it must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this  considering the energy  confidence  wit  empathy  boldness  silliness  cleverness  and sheer talent a job like this requires they rotate performers in and out so theres not even an intermission ive read comments about the baseness of the humor  but i had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes they had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds  cheeky  and quick witted he acted out every sport in the winter olympics  and was pretty into this 90 something year old lady in the audience called joan the other had crazy hair and bright blue chucks  beatboxed as well as he sang  and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friends birthday i think ray charles is the most soulful guy of all time  he said when she requested him  there were tons of people celebrating birthdays  and one big bachelorette party the saturday night i was there the performers bring the birthday boygirl  bachelorbachelorette  etc on stage for a $20 tip  which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends and humiliate the hell out of them  ie this is not the place to be if you cant laugh at yourself my friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano  and they sang a three minute song about her vagina  luckily  the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced  weak drinks  because those did feature heavily throughout the night the rest of the staff was friendly  however  and i stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself  which made me smile  sing sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing much like hofbrauhaus  but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion definitely belongs on every required pittsburgh experiences list
always a good time  although its definitely not a place i would visit often its great for groupswhich is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays   shut out to the piano players  who can not only play the piano  but also sing  play the drums and the sax they are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained also know some pretty obscure songs   my big criticism is the set up if you dont have a reservation andor come later in the evening  its difficult to get seats believe me  i dont mind standing  but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you if you do find a seat  it is often littered with someone elses empty glasses
waterfront lowes beats monroeville lowes for lawn and garden  hate to admit it  but its true
excellent wings and sandwiches  generally good food otherwise  and fair prices  nice casual place the service can be a little slow due to how popular the place gets at peak times
great atmosphere and even better people  wait staff was very friendly and the french onion soup was amazingdefinetly recommend the home made chips  great bar in the up and coming homestead areahighly recommend
were always looking for non chain restaurants by the waterfront they do exist  and this has become a favorite ive had the hot roast beef  fries and the corned beef on rye  and both were delicious every beer ive had here has been ice cold  and the service has been strong too its a great place to watch a pirates game too
food is good here great beer selection on tap sometimes the beer is on the pricey side what i want from a neighborhood bar is a neighborhood special pinkerton is one of the best sandwiches good place to watch football  hockey  baseball
one of my favorite local eateries the mild  wild sauce is my absolute favorite  i wish i could purchase it i am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great  reminds me of a fatheads sandwich food portion is great the only complaint i would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side  as usual in most local bars friendly service  will continue to frequent with my family
we recently ordered fish sandwiches from here they were huge we did get the large  but it was so big we couldve just shared one   was not over fried the french fries were hot and also very good we will definitely be going again to try something different
went to dukes last week they have really renovated the place  and added a lot of large screen tvs the best part  tho  is the vast improvement in draft beer selection i counted 46 beers on tap if you are a beer head and are at the waterfront shopping are  this is definitely one of your best choices  the food is above average  and the selection is common pub fare
my boys and i stopped here for dinner one night it was cold and dreary outside but warm and homey in here  our server was extremely nice the menu had lots of options they are kind of known for their potato soup so thats what i had it is very good its a very thick soup that is velvety smooth i would definitely order it again it was perfect for a rainy night  my youngest son had chicken tenders they looked a little over cooked but i tasted one and it was good the coating was crispy and the chicken was juicy my older son ordered wings with their house made sauce it was good but not spicy enough for him i thought it was good and would order it the next time i go
i love the games here but cant go very often since they dont rotate new games in very often  the place is usually pretty clean  pool tables often have a wait on the weekend but are some of the better ones youll find in the city  food is just ok drink prices are fair but not great
the usual fun center  you can play games using a play card which you purchase there  game prices can be confusing       23  57  99 credits  etc  the arcade can be fun if you bring some friends    almost every game is a ticket game and there are few innovative or exciting game choices  i didnt eat there  so i cant rate the restaurant part of dave and busters
we came here on a saturday night and luckily it wasnt as packed as i thought it would be i love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games sorry video game lovers we only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile i love their new wheel of fortune game on our first play  we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets they also have fruit ninja as a game it was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you dont win as many tickets as you would hope i wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other dbs ive been to  where you feed a counting machine your tickets at this place  they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count we didnt try the food here and instead went to pf changs to eat before coming here  but the eat  play deal looked fun too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day overall i had a blast here and definitely would come back hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion
i love dave and busters  it is a great place to go when you are wanting to have a great time with a great group of friends  if you find you and your friends bored on a friday or saturday night  come to db and win some prizes  it is pricey though  so bring some major moolah
not a cheap night out you will end up spending money here  but it is busy fun entertaining and a good time out  i ate dinner here and the food was great i also played pool and the arcade games
my friend and i both had friday off so we decided we wanted to do something more interesting than just hit up a bar on thursday night we settled on dave and busters i went on facebook and printed off a coupon for buy $20 get $20 in play free we split the card  it took us about 15 2 hours to get through  the games werent quite as fun as i remembered  but it was still a good time the place was far from crowded  and when a machine was out of tickets  it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us when we did  the team at db could not have been more accommodating to apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing   i think a lot of companies im looking at you  american airlines could learn a lot from db it cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games  but it made our experience so much better  drinks are half price after 8 or 9  my tropical mojito was awesome my friend and i are definitely planning on going back on a wednesday for half price games and half price drinks
visiting from toronto  i was really impressed the amount of tickets to be won was incredible we usually got 200 tickets per play on average compared to playdium here  thats awesome considering id win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets the food is great  the place is clean and the games dont feel greasy or nasty from all the food
i still love this place  i spent my 36th birthday at dbs and it was a wise decision  i had so much fun  and so did my guest  i got a very attentive serving staff  and met up with many helpful servers  i believe that service has improved  so i bumped this restuarant up to 4 stars  no five stars yet  because ive still as of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it  its still worth the visit  and is a lot of fun for a reasonable price
ill have a biased opinion of any place like this what could be wrong with playing old and new school games  drinking  and eating all at the same place? the one thing i can think of is the price on the surface  this is a pretty expensive place; however  they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go  whether or not you donate money to the make a wish foundation  and if youre lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes but honestly  know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available  in regards to the games  theres a plethora for your enjoyment although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets  the last couple of times ive gone ive gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price mario kart  anyone? either way  its a really fun place that youll most certainly have a good time at
this is a really fun way to spend an afternoon after several visits here  ive found a couple games that are easy to win and score you lots of tickets  and others that are just a blast to play we did really awesome last time we were here  and their prize room is full of some pretty neat stuff   their food is not too bad ive only ever eaten here once  and it wasnt that memorable  but i didnt hate it i did like that they have a bar  and they had my favorite beer on tap  that was nice   like pretty much any arcade ive ever been to  there are things that are a rip off  and occasionally something wont work properly that really irritates some people but i figure no arcade is perfect at least none that ive ever been to the most irritating thing for me is that some of the games have a call button on them that signals an employee to come assist you  and i kept hitting the button with my leg or something  so every once in awhile someone would randomly appear at my side and ask if i needed help  and i would be really confused haha   we went here with my husbands family on thanksgiving  and we had a total blast the whole place was pretty empty  and i felt really bad for the employees that had to work that day  but it was nice for us
chilling with kimberly vasil  mikey  big bob for the 961 kiss fm listener appreciation party  kiss really knows how to throw a bash  $10 power cards  free t shirts  megaphones  basketballs  appetizers  na beverages  apps are flowing  delicious  everybody is happy  nice bash kiss fm
ive probably only been to 3 dave  busters in my life  but this is probably my favorite one its a lot bigger and has more variety of games than the other 2 ive been to  though they pretty much have the same games the prizes are also better here  and the ticket exchange rate for the prizes seemed a lot more fair too definitely take advantage of the half priced games on wednesdays  i dont come for the food  since its very average with all these good restaurants close by  why dont just eat somewhere else and come for the games?
im a fan  i went to this one october 2014 i was in town for my favorite nfl team the colts steelers game i went to the game and had fun in the city  i went on half off wednesday i really had fun with the games im a young man and i like old nintendo games i like all kinds of games the skee ball game acted up  i had fun  i will go back not to this one because of the miles to far i will go to the ohio one  im a fan
i gave db 4 stars because our waiter was very geniune and nice the place has definitely changed over the years  becoming a very pricey venue the food was mediocre the fries were cold and the sliders were subpar  almost like white castles from the freezer section in most grocery stores my buffalo wings were rather tough as for the games  they were mostly the same  but included a lot of the newer app style games like flappy bird skeeball and free throw were still fun  along with the coin drop machines but  wow  we went through $50 of games really fast the gift section is full of fun tchotchkes and prizes if you pay enough to rack up the points nevertheless  it is still a great destination to celebrate any special occasion with family  friends or coworkers
fresh and goodbut i was starving  i will obviously be returning since i have such a favorable memory  i must say  though  my spicy chicken sandwich was fresh out of the fryer hot and very crispy while my bun was toasted  the french fries were also fried to an artery clogging perfection
ordered pizza and wings from here with delivery  the pizza was pretty decent but the wings were just so so    the prices were pretty good and delivery was quick  ill definitely order pizza from here again
nobody has reviewed this in a while  but i am surprised at the lack of lovin  my husband and i ate here a few nights ago and we liked it a lot  we started with drinks he got the house brewed portland wheat and said it was quite a good beer  and i got a mixed drink red rock that was also tasty    he got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and i got a mahi sandwich  both great the fries and side salads are good here too  and there is no skimping on portions of anything  there were tons of things on the menu that im looking forward to trying  we are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake who can resist a beer cheesecake  come on  our food and service was great  they had the penguins game on all the tvs in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game  seriously  whats not to like?  im thinking this place has changed for the better since the last review a year ago :
this is literally the first place i went when i first came to pittsburgh   and i loved it hearty  full sized meals  lots to choose from  and not too crowded or noisy although  for the sake of full disclosure  i didnt sit at the bar and i dont drink alcohol so i cant comment on that i go back to pittsburgh often and rock bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night really  i have no complaints about this place so im surprised by the few low ratings here
pretty good excellent beer sampler   bargain  veggie burger awesome onion rings awesome fried mac n cheese was delicious   crunchy on the outside  creamy on the inside carrot cake was monstrously huge and delicious
first off  i will say that i just moved here from california and was a big patron at the rockbottom in long beach i came to the homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location  now  rockbottom is a chain brewery  so a lot was the same the menu  the food prices yet beer is cheaper  and i am fine with that i have always found their food to be pricey  but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so i am fine with that the food here was just as good as the long beach location  so i have no problem with the chef at all  service was good  our waitress was very friendly and helpful i wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going  but that isnt a big thing went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartenders attention  but he was very friendly and i got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned i had just moved here i really enjoyed that  beer: we got the beer sampler to try the whole list and  well i found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison the light beer and the wheat were amazing  very impressed the pale was ok  as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night but both were way too citrusy the uppity ipa was very good i dont usually like ipas because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance still  couldnt do a whole glass i felt the imperial stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering i almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it not ice cream malt  for the non homebrewers the brown and amber were decent  but bland i ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it one point up on long beach  who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty  i really wanted to try the das gut dopplebock  but they were out looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so i hope i can catch that also want to try the snow moon belgian  verdict: while i was not too impressed with the dark beers  i found the lighter ones very good and i look forward to trying the other seasonal beers it is a good hour drive south to get there  so i wont be going too often  but i will be back
beer selection was good  but they were out of the ones we wanted 4 of the 6 people in our group ordered steaks all of them were cooked to their satisfaction the bourbanzola was a good addition defiantly a place i would go again joe  our server  was awesome and super friendly
rock bottom is a nice hangout place often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise great if your out to see a band  but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you    depending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booths and tables its alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area the bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender when the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining the view howevernot so picturesque  just the entrance to the improv which hey  that could be the perfect seat if youre stocking the local comics    the bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills on any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen tvs surrounding the bar area   the menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak   veggie or chicken they have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses  toppings and creative themes the bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a bourbon based glaze and gorgonzola cheese appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp steaks  pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu   on monday the burgers are half offi dont think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special however  if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gifts and specials   http:wwwrockbottomcommc   needless to say i have a fun beer glass collection thanks to rock bottomlol   now everyone favorite part about rock bottoms beers  the in house brew master keeps it interesting with a rotating variety of frothy yummy to try along with the consistant favorites of ale  ipas  rotating darks and kolsch   stop by on thursday nights for a colorful game of trivia where teams battle it out in a game of intelligence and drinking skills
weve all had this happen to us   you go past a place one hundred times and never go on then  once you finally do  you realize how many opportunities you wasted  rock bottom is definitely a solid bar as a microbrewery  their beer list is full of house brews there are better beers in the world  but there are a lot of worse beers out there  too   what really makes rock bottom standout  though  is the food my girlfriend and i shared an order of nachos  and it took everything we had to finish them they also make a mean soft pretzel   the waterfront may not be the most convenient thing to do while in pittsburgh  but no trip to the waterfront  is complete without a bite and a drink at rock bottom
rock bottom on thursday nights is the place to be team trivia starts at 8pm and it is free to play the dj todd is great   the food is good  but the ball park pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip is the best the wait staff is generally pleasant and on top of things  a few servers are excellent i am not a beer drinking so i havent tried the microbrews but the mixed drinks ive had have been good and a few of thier specials perfect   on nights that are not trivia nights  rock bottom is quiet and a good place for a small to medium party larger parties will usually be split into two tables   overall  an enjoyable place at which i am a regular
so i have not been to one of these in awhile since i normally have an aversion to chain restaurants  but since i was with colleagues on travel for work and they chose this place i went along   first surprise: decent beer  i remembered the normal rb brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles  including a very good imperial ipa that for $5glass cannot be beat  second surprise: pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than i expected  recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna   both were great   service was a little slow not sure why so a 4 star review is downgraded to 35 ill be back next time im in pittsburgh for work
the beer is good their light beer  lumpy dog  is very good  doesnt taste like a light beer when i was pregnant i became quite a fan of their root beer floats  too  as others have noted  the pretzels are really good im not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband likes it veggie burgers are always good  too  though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order  say  the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger long  long ago  when i used to go to the rock bottom in boston  there was a hot mushroom  sundried tomato  cheese dip on the menu that was fantastic if they resurrect that i will gladly add another star
ive always been pleasantly surprised with the food ive gotten at rock bottom  i say surprised because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a chain  you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds  but ive really had a lot of good meals at rock bottom  now  granted  you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are a bar straunt if you will  and dont get anything above and beyond this places call of duty  for instance  i will never be ordering the ahi tuna  ill leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water the mon doesnt count  but besides that  i always really enjoy my meal choices  ive recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich  chicken was grilled perfectly  plenty of avocado  and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive  ive also ordered the margherita pizza  which could definitely be split between two people  its an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle  the pizza was really great  the crust was crispy  it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes  and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty  and not greasy whatsoever   big bonus points there  but my biggest surprise as of late was when i ordered their chicken flautas  im a huge mexican food fan and always hesitate to order mexican outside of a mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed  but i had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it  it was delicious  the flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch  and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients  the accompanying rice was nice and moist as well  i was so happy  ive always been quite happy with the service there as well  i go on thursday evenings for trivia  and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on  the ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive  only once or twice  to my memory  has my service been sub par  and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed trivia night with only two visible servers helping 50  people  i definitely give rock bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain found food and making it fresh  yummy  and worth coming back for more
happy hour at rock bottom  2 thumbs up  good prices  the pizza is delicious  drinks are a few dollars off the regular price  good service  and the atmosphere is always casual and fun
rock bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl  as expected  the bar was lively  the food was good  and the service was accommodating   the beers are better than church brew works and the bar was populated  the bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl   i vote for rock bottom as the anchor store of the water works
i havent been to rock bottom in years  maybe even decadesis that even possible?  well  either way  its been awhile  so with my gift certificate i took my brother out for a birthday dinner    as i get older  my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower  as a result  i told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the waterfront before everyone goes out for date night  plus the pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game  when we arrived  the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table  our server was very attentive  friendly and helpful  right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers  we loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said  i have to go back for the rest  in all we were served 10 different beers each in 3 oz glasses  maybe 4   i can never tell  i gotta say  rock bottom knows their beer  i liked more than i didnt  and very few were not to my liking  so the $695 10 beer sampler was well worth it    during our sampling we indulged on some southwest egg rolls  they were okay  but not quite what i expected  the spicy ranch was top notch  though  as we ran out of beer  we each ordered up a kobe burger  they were both cooked exactly to our liking medium  and to top off our wonderful evening  the pirates brought home a win  my only complaint  as a beer drinker  is the cost for a growler  the glass container itself is sold for $1295  thats the empty price  to me  thats a little ridiculous when east end only charges $3 for the bottle and penn brewery $5  paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me  so i walked out empty handed    but it wont deter me from returning
i very much enjoyed my first visit here i got the turkey meatloaf and it was really tasty its more sausage than turkey the cheesy mashed potatoes were excellent the star of the night was the appetizer  the artichoke and crab dip it was awesome my only complaint was i ordered a red ale and they were out i had the curmudgeon instead and it was very good  but still
first time i was here i had chicken quesadillas and they were bad  we went again last weekend i had the chicken avacod sandwich  it was very good  no fat in the chicken  just a mess to eat  but still awesome   also had the chocolate stout cupcake  it was amazing
thanks to the staff here for being so friendly and cool with our whole mess  rock bottom allowed our bachelorette party to eat and drink and hang after dave and busters orphaned us
went to rock bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased my coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer the waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla if you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from chilis   the filling tasted like that and i am a big fan   mondays are half off burger days and i tried the just hot enough burger   topped with crispy jalapenos  pepper jack cheese  pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup it was delish the ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy   the prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on monday  its totally worth it i think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but dont expect for pay under $10 for a sit down   i felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive the service was quick and i think you can get in and out in under an hour
mostly come here for the beer and sports fun place
i go to rock bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer  so i was really really excited to have my bridal shower there  my maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant  my moh and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with  my shower was wonderful  the wait staff was great and kept everyones glasses full  it started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldnt get wet when taking them out to the car  the only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home  there was salmon  chicken  potatoes  and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldnt box it up  not sure why  they cant re serve it  it would have just gone to waste  also  not at all related to the shower  their trivia night is super fun
im giving 4 stars mostly because of the beerlarge selection  decent prices   the food is pretty good  but nothing to rave about  the menu has a good variety  and everything ive tried has been good  portions are large    one side of the restaurant is the bar  bar atmospherewith several tvs  2 pool tables  its very wide open with extremely high ceilings  the other side is more for families or people who arent concerned about watching sports  in general  it has a relaxed atmosphere  ive always had quick  friendly service    i love the whole waterfront areaso much to do
im not much of a beer drinker  but my fiancee is a major enthusiast  so i agreed to tag along  im glad i did  our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house brewed beer selection  and helped me to pick one i would love the kolsch was very crisp  light  and drinkable  the food was standard pub fare with a twist  well executed  my burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola  and cooked to perfection  the waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side  which was definitely a good choice  my only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy  and i spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch  not sure i would make the hour  trip to pittsburgh again  but if i found myself in the city  i may just stop by
im a regular here since their kitchen is open late and its a good option after movies their nachos is pretty good i also tried their burger and chicken sandwiches and theyre good as well  i think the only thing i didt like is the steak taco appetizer it was too sour and kinda tasteless
the cajun pasta i ordered was just spicy enough to keep me sipping my rock bottom ipa it may be a chain but i always get that microbrew restaurant feel when im here they could upgrade the quality of the servers but ive never had a really bad experience with the service
i really miss the northstar amber but the specialty beers are always good  food is excellent and the service staff is friendly
another good meal  this time the housemade meatloaf its a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef a refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies the server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile service was prompt just the same overall good experience
i have to say that ive only been here when it was very busy i found the service fairly quick and any of the food ive had has been delicious i went there tonight and there was an issue with my food without going into detail  i will say they handled it wonderfully our waitress mallory was very kind and she was quick to fix the problem i had the salmon for the second time and it was just as amazing as it was the first time i had one beer thats similar to a blue moon and that was good too i would go back again
the staff here is very nice and the set up has tvs all around the family so enjoy mostly all sports  the music is nice and pretty mellow and the place is very spacey and the prices are pretty reasonable and most importantly is the place seems to be kept clean at all times
good food and large portions i ordered the veggie burger for $850 and i loved it its one of the most unique veggie burgers i have ever had: a homemade patty of beans  rolled oats and veggies the chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph my burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price as for drinks  im a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste  i could tell it was very good quality beer bitter and sweet  with a slight tang i rarely drink beer but i im going to  then might as well drink the best kind there is   fresh and microbrewed  note: there arent too many options for vegetarians the veggie burger was pretty good and id recommend it  but other than that  theres also the veggie tacos  a few select appetizers  and a few salads from which to choose
ive never been crazy about the food here  but my friend likes it  so i do eat here once in a while we stopped in last night and i had the chicken finger appetizer with fries the food was a little overcooked and nearly tasteless the ranch dressing was barely good enough to make up for it   my friend had the mac  cheese with chicken and bacon  which is what she orders just about every time shes there it looked delicious and the portion was huge ill be trying this dish next time were there   weve also had the ball park pretzels in the past  and theyre really good   im giving 4 stars because the service was great  theres outdoor seating  and the berry bash sangria was delicious if expensive well be back
every time ive been here the food has always been delicious and the service has always been very exceptional my go to is the laredo burger and the mac ncheese as a side they mac n cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic ive had a few other menu options as well that have been superb the beers on tap are always great my newest favorite is the first pumpkin ale   one thing i really appreciate about rock bottom is that they arent one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when youre done eating the food comes out fast which is great when youre starving but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions theres never any rush i was just at rock bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didnt start until 11pm we got at the restaurant around 7:30  ordered drinks  ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to walk over to the cinemas it was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering  my only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask medium often turns into medium well  but thats not a huge problem for me i also dont think the signature cocktails are worth $9  but thats more of a corporate complaint since rock bottom is a small chain   overall i definitely recommend eating here if youre in the waterfront
i am not a fan of chain restaurants typically and had to slowly break my boyfriend from wanting to eat at chain restaurants all of the time the one chain that i cant break from is rock bottom   their beer is always good  as far as their staples go  i really love their white ale their seasonal ipas have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout yes  it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around christmas and their smoky bbq brown ale tasted like summer  complemented bbq amazingly ; they had it this past summer  i bought a growler of it lol   as far as their food goes  i typically stay away from the appetizers $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go ive had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10   almost every time i go i order the baja chicken sandwich its my favorite chicken sandwich so good the chicken is actually grilled which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches and i love the charred flavor that it has the bun is soft but sturdy and doesnt fall apart while eating the sandwich  the sauce is amazing  the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least theres a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich mhm i love it my boyfriend usually gets the hickory bbq bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well   another item i always get their apple coleslaw ive yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant so simple  yet oh so good   they also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones   their side salads are awesome as well they are decent in size  spring mix topped with sunflower seeds  raisins  half of a hard boiled egg which i give to the boyfriend  chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons yum   i usually order the same thing every time i go i steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless which turned me off to trying new items there plus i am just too in love with the baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else   service is always great  the bartenders are friendly i love this place ask about their rock bottom rewards 
i always enjoy rock bottom standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well   i prefer the bar seating as to the dining room  but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos   nachos  nachos  nachos truly the best in the area great burgers  chili and salads reallyi dont think ive had a bad meal here nice outdoor seating in the summer   this is a great place to watch a game or just hang out iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold  i know they have other cocktails here  but i cant order them at a beer place ive seen them and they do look good  but im stuck to the beer selection   they have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week   service is always great whether there are two or 10 of us
we have been going to rock bottom for sevesrl years and love it it is our go to place  when we want a nice meal  in a nice atmosphere   with good service we have had 1 maybe 2 not so great visits but for the most part  service is excellent and the food is consistent  after leaving another restaurant just trying to do something new for a celebration because of poor service  we were greeted and seated in a few seconds  our server was at our table within seconds even though she had a large 10 to 12 guests group at the table near us we had our drinks in minutes and were checked on twice within 5 minutes our food came out rather quickly and was delicious our server was very attentive and social as usual  a save by our go to place i know we will retun here again
on a friday i went to rock bottom with some friends for their happy hour which takes place from 4 6 our server was a spunky brunette who was very attentive and even let us sample as many beers as we liked until deciding i ultimately decided on the pom berry cosmo which was excellent i also got the ball park pretzel which is amazing during happy hour its only $5 and you get two big pretzels served with this delicious cheese dip my friends got the nachos  the quesadilla  and the artichoke cheese dip everything was very tasty
first  i have to say that ive been here twice in the past few months  and each time was with a very large group one group of 20  one group of over 30 on a weekend evening and im thoroughly impressed with the friendly  efficient and professional manner in which the accommodate groups whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks  they are flawless lots of other restaurants could learn from them impressively  even with providing separate checks to such large groups  they chose not to add gratuity and we obliged with good tips  l managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time  and processed payment of the checks in no time at all bravo to this restaurants management and service staff  its top notch  that being said  the food and beer aint all that bad either fish  chips  chicken macn cheese  salmon bites  guacamole and the makers mark burger are all quite good  as are the beers the kolsch is my favorite
great bar great atmosphere great food cool place to be  definitely one of those places you could keep going back just because its so chill and its a great place for friends to just enjoy some drinks and eat some good food nothing too too spectacular by any means but satisfies the taste buds their apps are the best part and the highlight of the restaurant  in my opinion the nachos can be split among 4 5 people easy lots of toppings and yummy all around
great american style bar food with quite a lot to pick from the both the food and drink menus they are also great at accommodating large groups and these are one of the few places that allow you to call ahead to reserve a spot been here plenty of times with my group and we enjoyed it every time
i am a fan of rock bottom  this is my 2nd time here and i can say i am a fan  we went on a saturday night after a day at sandcastle  the wait was 45 60 mins for a table of 5 which was to be expected on a saturday evening   our server wasnt the best in my opinion  she was very friendly and some what attentive but it definitely took awhile to place our orders in for our drinks  appetizers  and meals    since we were all hungry  i ordered us the nachos  they were awesome  very happy and pleased with that selection my sister ordered pretzels which were pretty good but the clearly had too much salt on them  the cheese dip that came with the pretzels however was awesome  definetly pleased with our selection  we placed our order  which came out in a timely fashion  everyone was pleased  the prices for the meal were about average for everything that you got  i got the the margarita pizza which was pretty good  my wife got jalpeno burger with fries  my son got the kids pizza  my sister and her husband got the seafood taco with shrimp and crab i believe  the best part of this place is that they brew their own beer here  everyone got a honey beer cant remember the exact kind but it was 775 for 25oz which was a fair price i think    all in all  its def a place worth going
good beer  food and service arrived on a wednesday night for business and sat at the bar bartender was attentive and nice food was great i had the bison prairie burger it was cooked perfectly and the flavor and fries were great ill be coming here again on my next business trip
they did a good job accommodating a large group mac n cheese with chicken and bacon was good in house beers were moderate and selection was limited good service  franchise ish ambiance  nothing extraordinary but easy enough
im not someone thats mechanically inclined  so i cant say for sure that the deal i got was a good one but that said alan and the crew at master muffler certainly appears to have done a great job fixing my car to a degree better than i expected and at a price much lower than i was expecting and with a great warranty on their work i feel comfortable knowing that if there is a problem ill be covered i would absolutely recommend them to all my friends
the improv comedy club at the waterfront is the best comedy club in pittsburgh because there is only one other one and this one gets more famous comedians i go there just about every other week  pros: great comedians all year round the fooddrinks are very good and the wait staff is wonderful the improv is a great venue for upcoming and new comedians  i always see new  local talent opening for national comedians in one show you will see 1 2 local comedians  and 1 2 national touring comedians the improv has a nice environment inside with general admission seating first come  first serve the email list is essential in order to receive free ticket packages and perks  as well as reminders of upcoming comedians  cons: prices can be steep it is expensivedifficult to be a regular food and drinks are not cheap no specials expect to pay $15  $40 for tickets depending on the headliner with a two item minimum waiting in line before the shows wouldnt be bad if you werent forced to stand outside in any and all weather conditions if it is raining and youd like a good seat  you will pay the price   overall: this 21  venue is a great place to spend a night out with friends or loved ones you may buy tickets in advance onlinephone or buy your tickets at the box office at the location i highly recommend joining the mailing list to receive free tickets check the calendar for upcoming shows and open mic nights during the week support local comedy  and enjoy the improv at the waterfront
i always enjoy a good comedy club and though im a loyal helium fan  i gotta give props to the improv near pittsburgh they chose a great location  with surrounding restaurants of all genres and fun bars and shopping   we bought tickets to see a comedian i had never heard of he was decent for $25 each with a two item purchase minimum i really dislike that rule but you cant really get around it   the only thing i didnt like  aka hated  was having to wait in line outside before the show started it was freeeeezing they should put heaters outside seriously
you know that place where youve never gone  then you go  then youre going all the time? well the improv for me is one of these places  i am thankful to have a venue to see some of my favorite comedians  most recently i saw hannibal burris  tommy johnigan and doug benson all three performances were a hooting good time   on saturday afternoon at 2:20pm i went to see doug benson i was accompanied by my boyfriend you may know doug benson from the hit documentary super high me  ok so:  pros  wonderfully talented comedians  clean bathrooms  pretty wait staff  has coors light on tap  575 per draft  every seat in the house is a good seat   cons: expensive drinks expensive food  flavorless food  dirty silverware  far from my house  mayo with french fries   any way  i have enjoyed all my visits to the waterfront  i can certainly see myself seeing more shows at the improve  the club is well maintained and the wait staff is friendly   bring a lot of money with you  youre going to need it i dont know if its true everywhere but at this improve there is are 2 item person  minimum order requirement    they served us warm mayo with our fries  what is this holland that sht was gross it was both gross and also unusual  anyhow to catch a comedy show at the improve is a pleasure
this was my second visit to the club and it was still a blast my girlfriends bought tickets for john witherspoon for my bachelorette we were all looking forward to it and it was hilarious he was wonderful   the servers were fantastic they always came back to check in on us and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink i suggest the pink cadillac for a drink as well as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert   the only reason it isnt 5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building we were to see the 9pm showing so the doors were to open at 8:45pm they came out and explained that the show had run over and we wouldnt be able to even enter the building until 9:20pm it was 28 degrees outside we finally were able to enter the building  order drinks then the show finally started at 9:45pm  the host did offer a blanket apology which was nice but hardly made up for the fact the show started almost an hour late
i have been here twice in the last month its a pretty great time my first visit  the service was pretty poor and the food was cold by the time it got to the table we had to sit all the way in the back and the comedian was not that good although that is no fault of the club but when i went to the second show  the service was much improved the burger i ordered was fantastic and warm our waitress kept the drinks coming without interrupting us while the comedian was on stage we were also able to sit in the front this time and it was a great experience ill be going back soon
good i cant comment on the food or the bathrooms  but from what experienced it was great the drinks were decent  and i  believe you must order two items at minimum the staff is quick  but they should have more people working on a saturday night before you can ask for anything else they bolt to the next table or to the kitchen  the comics we saw were funny as well will definitely go back
i was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to go here to see funny man bill crawford  part of the dve morning show for those of you who never heard of him  that is funny because as i was telling people about going it became clear there are a lot of people that havent oh well let me mention this was my first time there  so i was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum  well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait  walked right in  greeted  an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order  this was nice  i will say that the show started at 8pm  and we were there by 7:20 or so  there were already people seated so we were by no means very early  and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10  the price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu  leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month  but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head ipa for $600  now that may seem rather expensive and it is  but doable so i indeed did it my husband got a domestic and it was between 4 5 bucks  we opted not to eat there  as we were going to rock bottom after wards and i will get to that review later  so the show was good  there were moments that i think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering  but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable  there were a total of 4 comedians  the mc  and two opening acts for crawford  i actually really enjoyed them    the one or two things i didnt like about the place  the bathrooms are in the lobby  as this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated this wasis stupid  i was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance  the same also goes for smoking  since we were so early i took a break and it was again awkward reentering  maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this  a stamped hand?  a ticket stub?  not sure but i know i would have felt better unlike feeling like i was sneaking into the place    i would definitely return to the improv  i just hope i always have a rather positive experience
i went here for the first time the other night and had a great time  the comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends  my only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket  but every person needs to buy 2 items of fooddrink and the drinks arent cheap around $10 12  however  i would definitely go back sometime
wast there last friday seats right in front if the stage the show was good the headliner  while a bit long  was good fantastic service from our waitresses will definitely go back
absolutely loved it at the improv i saw sheryl underwood and she was fantastic it was my first time being at the improv after years of saying that i wanted to go  it really did meet my expectations the ambiance is inviting  with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place we were 8th in line so we had good choice of seating  though we were encouraged to fill the seats in the front by the stage first the seating is layered in tiers each tier has a long booth with tables and chairs for seating it was very comfortable  roomy and an interactive set up the stage is close to the seating some tables are right at the stage with little space between you and the comedian  which made it very interactive and fun we arrived at the improv around 9:45 pm for a show that started at 10:30 pm  with doors opening at 10:00 pm we waited in line until the doors opened at about 10:15 10:20 pm  so they were really behind schedule the show started around 10:45 pm with two opening comedians before the main act the show was over around 1:00 am the only negatives were that the staff was not very friendly and immediately told me that i have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu $30ticket isnt enough? i was not hungry and did not want to drink  so this was a bit frustrating  especially because it wasnt disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else the server did not hold us to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and i got away getting 3 drinks for the night the food menu looked great and the prices seemed reasonable  though if you want water you are looking at $5 for fiji or sparkling it was $8 for a glass of wine $11 for bottomless soda  complete with a take home improv glass the other thing that i didnt like was that an employee takes your tickets while youre waiting in line and marks your hands with a dry erase marker after one bathroom trip  the mark was gone  so i think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already paid customer since the employee takes your proof of purchase these negatives did not affect my overall experience negatively and i would most certainly go back it is a fun place where you are guaranteed to have a good time with a lot of laughter
nice little venue for quality fun  i saw greg warren here last night and had a really good time    check out yippitcom or sign up for goldstarcom before buying tickets at full price you can usually find substantial discounts for shows on one of those two sites sure theres a two drink minimum but im thinking that it helps pay for the comics and helps keep the price of admission down  when you think about it  its really a win win
the waterfront at homestead is insane  and saves me the trip of driving all the way to ross park mall anyway  the giant eagle here is enormous  as youd imagine its still a standard giant eagle  aka the best grocery store ever
i like this giant eagle they have the organic section and theyre currentlyfeb 2011 in the process of remodeling too  which is both annoying now and exciting for the future  pros: always seems to be decent parking available; they have those cute little double tier carts; organics section; wine vending machine thats freaking awesome yay  pennsylvania; lots of self check out lanes;  cons: sometimes the staff is a bit cranky but that can occur anywhere  i guess;
as far as ges go  this location is great it has basically everything you need and is well organized you can find a lot of ethnic ingredients you cant get at other ge stores they also offer a wine kiosk  hot bar  salad bar  and bulk olives i would venture to say this is better than the market district
waterfront geagle is my primary market now that theyve expanded and reorganized  i rarely even have to set foot in target anymore yippie theres a wine kiosk suck it pa liquor laws  you can buy crazy expensive 6 packs  cheese market  bakery  salad and hot bar  butcher  florist  dry cleaners  international foods  pharmacy  and a little cosmeticsbeautybath area they usually have a sufficient number of lanes open  and it doesnt get nearly as crowded as market district i do wish a bulk spice selection was included as part of the expansion  but you cant always get what you want  i suppose
youre getting an extra star for two solid reasons    one is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again and a bit fancier  two  and thee most important part  this iggle has the best quality and well made sushi out of any iggles out there  believe me  ive eaten many a rainbow roll from many different locations around the burgh and nothing has compared  dare i say  its as close as you get to going to a good sushi restaurant  bold statement  right?   i  just love me some sushi and want it often  quick and convenient and this serves all those purposes with upholding the quality  need a quick sushi fix?  this place is it
oddly enough  of all the giant eagles i have visited in pittsburgh  this is the only location that carries the toothpaste that ive used for most of my life outside of pittsburgh the location is clean and the staff are friendly  i sometimes resent having a market district being the closest giant eagle to my apartment  as many of the items that i buy there are severely overpriced but whenever i run out of groceries and toothpaste at the same time  i take the hike down to waterfront to shop here  although they may not carry all the groceries that id like
this is a absolutely beautiful giant eagle  i only stopped in to grab a quick bite from the prepared foods section  but i was rather impressed by how clean it was  it was 9 oclock at night  and they still had a huge section of prepared foods available  the starbucks inside was closed  probably due to the fact it was a sunday night  but that is another plus
im with rachel c on this one you get an extra star for being a pretty giant eagle and a cafe with a very decent beer selection of 6packs and individual bottles even though the giant eagle in robinson is better in my opinion you  waterfront giant eagle  are not bad and pretty close to where i live
i found everything i needed and i liked the expansion  the antipasta bar is on point and they sale vanilla coke which made my hubby very happy   great store
just about every you need  with great hours  a solid hot bar  sushi if youre into that   a dry cleaning service  pharmacy  tons of produce  bakery and butchers counter you cant go wrong two things that drive me crazy always needing to use my perks card for self check out and the lack of hand carts in the front i always have to walk to a lane and hunt for a basket then double back  super annoying   that said its a small  and easily repairable hint issue that shouldnt keep you from visiting
one of the best grocery stores in the area good produce  wide variety of cheeses  good cuts of meat and theres even a six pack shop on the premise
years ago i would have given the big bird 2 stars what changed my mind? competitive pricing  thanks  ge for making it worthwhile to shop your sales while your no aldi  you definitely are winning on this front   this is my goto ge always clean  organized and great selection added beer a couple years ago and the deli  prepared foods are up to par as well  always busy and parking never an issue
i luv store  plenty of cashiers my father eats there couple times a week he is a senior citizen and he usually get free coffee because he is a veteran last week he was told they no longer doing that program today he went to the edgewood giant eagle and they gave him free coffee
this giant eagle is one of the only things i miss about  old house the produce section and deli were great also had an overall nice selection of everything
one comfy seat in the entire place  but they have a cafe  they have good books to look at  and they are open until 11pm  what more could you want?  why an apple purse of course  and a nice earl gray tea thrown in for good measure  wowi love this place  i am such a nerdonly a nerd would enjoy going to a book store and reading as much as i do  the extra amenities just make it that much more enjoyable
like any barnes  noble  it has a nice comfy cafe  and a large selection of books  the staff is very friendly and helpful  they stock a decent selection  and the prices are pretty reasonable  obviously its hard for them to compete with amazon  however since all the small shop bookstores are gone  its nice to walk into one every once in a while
i love books i love to look at them  hold them  read the cover  thumb through the pages  and then finally i love to dig into a juicy story when im in the area i love coming in here for a latte and book browsingreading most of the time i cave and buy a book  this store is clean and their employees are helpful and kind they have two entrancesexits available  a fairly large section for movies  music  study guides  and other organized sections like self help and history i personally love the variety of cook books there one of the attractive points of this store is a cafe i can come in  sit down  read a magazine or book and just chill the downside is the chairs arent super comfortable to me and the cafe is usually packed with people i wish they had more seating options around the store  its a convenient location to come in and kill some time like others have mentioned theres a lot to find in there so come back and browse
fantastic food  this place is mainly a bar and does get crowded but i really like the pizza here  in fact ive never had a bad meal  the staff are ussually very helpful but it does get a bit loud inside when crowded
dont even think about not getting the pretzel dippers its pretzel sticks with honey mustard  cinnamon butter  and a spicy queso dip the queso is my favorite but they were all delish i also got the bruschetta which was very garlicky but delicious 5 7 m f is 12 off appetizers so i was able to get both the pretzel sticks and bruschetta for 7 bucks as a meal the menu had a pretty wide range  my friend very much enjoyed a pear and chicken salad we didnt get drinks but some looked good
went here for drinks and nachos and it is a very nice establishment  the nachos were very good the drinks pricy but t be expected in a setting like this place  there are fire places outside on the patio a huge bar and even though it doesnt seat many there is a very nice cozy setting upstairs  go here to relax or enjoy good food both thumbs up
ive eaten just once  mostly i go for drinks nice  lively place  nice outdoor seating for the summer and fall drinks are good  service is good location is great as well  right across the movie theater
love the ambiance and food
haha only came here once for happy hour  but i am just pleased with the price i guess coming from ny  anything would be better price wise $3 for draft and a big selection of beers so good times also its right across the theater so its a good place to go and chill before the movie starts which is exactly what i did haha
i must say  my experience last night at bar louie was wonderful i was hesitant to go because of the other reviews here  but my husband convinced me to give it a try  the place is seat yourself and its loud in there i was a little underwhelmed by that at first but i got used to it and found myself enjoying the energy our service was fantastic courtney was great   super attentive  brought our drinks out in less than 5 minutes  brought our food quickly  checked on us just enough and the place was packed the drinks were perfect  just strong enough we tried the peach lighting and the tiki drink i liked the tiki thing better but thats just personal choice there were real berries mixed into that one yum on to the food my turkeyhambrie sandwich was delicious and my husband loved his burger the highlight of the meal though was the whiskey cake sonnet worthy well definitely go back again
man  haters gonna hate  listen  yall  bar louie isnt fancy  its just not and their extensive martini list wont fool me  however  the food is good ole american bar grub and their beer selection is decent  the staff has been nothing but nice even when my wannabe rowdy group of friends spent many a summer day sitting a table for four hours drinking dollar beers  as long as bar louie still keeps having $1 burger days tuesdays and $1 beer days wednesdays  i will continue to be a fan  fyi  its a fanatically cheap movie  dinnerdrinks weekday date spot
i rather like bar louie for my outdoor dining experience after biking the rail trail or before a movie  been there twice now for both of before mentioned occasions and both times had their appetizers  note that if you can catch them during their happy hour from 5 to 7pm on weeknights  your pocket book will thank you  the two of us diners selected three appetizers to share the first visit and two on the second visit and were quite satisfied with presentation  quantity  and quality  i would highly recommend the bruschetta pomodoro and the calamari breaded just right and not overdone
its what i expected cooler then a fridays and the food was about the same it was clean and out waiter was really cool it was so slow he even took a seat with us and chatted but in a good way and we welcomed him to do so i had the bar louie burger for my meal and it was good nothing outstanding but again what i expected my group ordered the avocado fries and meatball appetizers the avocado fries were good but we had to add salt the meat balls with the small slices of garlic bread was fun to share and yummy  we went on a slow sunday night it was clean and the food came out on time again i rate a places on what i expect it to be and what it trys to be not what i think it should be so just a different kind of fridays also great music playlist
my boyfriend and i dined at bar louie at the waterfront about a month ago; it was my first time eating there and i was pretty impressed  we got loaded nachos as an appetizer and all the toppings were as fresh as they come  not to mention delicious  i ordered pasta i cannot remember the name but i asked for no artichokes in it it turned out the artichokes were pre mixed in the recipe  but the waitress came and informed us that the chef was whipping up a special batch just for me i was extremely grateful and impressed  everything was delicious  the decor was industrial chic which i love and the atmosphere was buzzing and fun the menu was a tad exotic for my small town pallet  but it was great my only complaint was the fact that you had to seat yourself  because we wandered around the crowded restaurant for about 10 minutes before we found a seat the food and service certainly made up for it though
dollar beers on wednesday night and loaded tater tots  pretty much two solid reasons to visit  matter of fact  they have some sort of special every night of the week wether it be food or drinks or both  located across from the movie theater this is a good place to go before or after a flick with your hot date  i say skip over priced burgatory and come here on tuesday for dollar burgers  just as good and half the bill
was there for saturday dinner at 6pm and still had some seats opened  we sat down right away  you sat yourself and menu was at the table   very casual place  yet family place   a little noisy so not for date nights  a little bit sports bar like but not like champs  food was great  had boneless chicken nuggets el fuego  side salad was very good  i had verde chicken pasta and my husband had cod skewers with shrimp fried rice   i had some and it was delicious  clean bathroom  very important
great place for late dinner after work kitchen stays open late real good food full bar and real good service great location
i love bar louies happy hour $5 martini and half priced delicious veggie flatbread? sign me up  they also have a few other apps that  are part of the happy hour  but the flatbread is the one i usually get   the melon martini is my current favorite  but most that ive tried have been good  i dont recommend the shrimp appetizer and im not sure about some of the other food  but happy hour is 55 stars the rest of the time  bar louie is probably a 3 star place   so  if youre in the waterfront and are thinking of bar louie  go for the happy hour
im not into waterparks as much as i am into amusement parks  i go to sandcastle maybe once a year  but my chicago friend catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo  we donned our swimsuits and came here  the main part of the park is closed in the evenings  but the sandbar and the sandbar pool and the hot tub remain open for the 21 and over set  the sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $600 cover charge to get in  occasionally theres live entertainment  its hard to believe that before they built this place  it was the site of an abandoned steel mill  actually  it was the railroad yard for the nearby homestead works  but after site clearing and clean up  they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening  the view across the mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side  theres even a boat dock  so you can arrive by river if you desire  im glad i renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully  ill get another chance to come back
how many times do you get to fall at 70mph  wearing only shorts? sandcastle can make it happen  if youre going  its best to stop by giant eagle and grab you some discount tickets from the customer service desk  $25 is still a bit much in my opinion  but its better than spending the full $3099  there isnt much i can think of thats in sandcastle that isnt a great time  except maybe walking around and scorching your feet on the boardwalk  i personally am a huge fan of some of the faster tube slides  and of course the massive speed slide  if youre looking for a more relaxed ride  check out the lazy river  or screw around in the big pool  theres also a pretty nice wave pool there for your amusement  theres also plenty of stuff for kids to do but i dont have kids  so i dont know how all that is  they do close at 7pm  which is a bit early  so be warned: you definitely want to show up earlier in the day  but its definitely a good idea to close the park if you can: right toward the end  the lines disappear  and you can ride over and over  win
so the last time i went to a water park was probably when i was in elementary school and didnt really know how to swim  i still kinda dont lol anyway  it was in california at raging rivers and it was a traumatizing experience screaming  being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet not fun  so to say the least  i was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling i was being drowned luckily that did not happen  i seriously had so much fun here i honestly was only expecting to go on the lazy river pool all day but with my bf  we hit up so many rides tandem and single rides i feel like such a big girl now definitely lean back while youre on those single donuts on the water rides  or else you feel like youre going to flip over while swishing down the tubes the new dragon ride they just opened up was okay i was expecting it to be so much more fun  but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it   there was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds  then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times it was weird kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through although it was still fun the last dude threw me in backwards scared the crap out of me but it was fun :  the food here is surprisingly pretty affordable plus  who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit me dont want no pot belly   overall i had such a fun time here it definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks by the way  we went on a saturday in early june and it wasnt as packed as i thought it would be so the lines werent long at all also  go to giant eagle to purchase your discounted tickets you save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park oh and dont forget to bring sandals while walking around your feet will literally feel like theyre burning from the ground now go off and have some fun :
now heres a place that knows what it is a place to ride a few slides  relax on the lazy river  and watch the hilarious pittsburghers walk around with jesus tattoos and many children   come for the slides  stay for the people watching
havent been to tgifridays for years and was never really a huge fan i get tired of going to the same places all the time for lunch so we decided to try it out i must say that i was very impressed with how extensive the menu was and all of the delicious options i had the two for $10 lunch special with french onion soup and terriakyi glazed chicken strips i was told that the broccoli soup is very thick so i opted for the french onion it was okay but i think that i would get a salad instead of the soup next time the chicken strips were wonderful and i am still craving them the portion was huge and there were leftovers my co workers ordered the jack daniels sampler and burgers and were jealous at the portion and choices from the pick two the service was good and we had no issues i will definitely be back
dining outdoors after a bike ride on the rail trail  just the right venue for that  jack daniels ribs and shrimp  the ribs were divine  the shrimp not quite there   id say they were overdone    our server  ed  was very attentive  i asked for celery in my bloody mary  not only did it come with a celery stalk in it  he brought over more celery  yummmm
good food    i guess one reason i like this place is they dont hide how bad the food is for you there is a little kiosk with all the calories right by the door  all in all i get the flat bread pizzas and really enjoy them  the steaks are also good and the price is reasonable  service is always friendly and the establishment is kept really clean and neat
i didnt know what to expect when i walked in  but i am now a fan there is a cool way to review the menu on a touch kiosk to find out the calorie count   the place looked nice it was clean and really cool looking the food was really good and our waiter was nice and friendly i will be going back to try their pizza and other food   we had a burger  which was really good  and we had the lobster slider french fries were good to
my girlfriends made reservations here for my bachelorette party last saturday i highly suggest that you make reservations because we were able to just walk right in and sit down there were people there waiting 30 minutes  we had the sangria which was amazing our sever alex recommend it and it was perfect for the 4 of us  i had their thin crust pepperoni pizza which really hit the spot my two friend had salads which they said were amazing and my other friend joined me in ordering a pesto chicken pizza lets just say there wasnt any food left on the table when we were finished  i will be back for sure
unos has been around for ever   i feel like this restaurant chain peak in popularity in the 80s honestly the decor inside still kind of looks 80s to me even though its nice with sleek booth and exposed brick  if you havent died and he recently i ordered you to come back and have a meal here again because honestly the food is really quite good  they have the best chicken salad wrap ever i love that rap so much i want agreed to walk the south side river trail from where the steelers practice all the way to the damn waterfront just because i knew that i could convince my boyfriend to go to unos with me for lunch  full disclosure:  i made him call is a cab and we took a taxi back to the parking lot after lunch  listen the food and pizza and service are very good  surprisingly so i dont know why this place is not busier but next time youre down at the waterfront please do consider dining here
all in favor of a deep dish pizza say iiiiiiii   ok now that i have that out of my system this place is such a great hangouteat in spot i hadnt been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening i was so glad they were paying cause  i was low on funds at the time  we arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there we waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasnt bad considering the crowd we looked over the menu and they have so many great choices pizza  pasta  appetizers  seafood  burgers  salads and sandwiches   after ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food we both are going gluten free which is tough but unos gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from plus they make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great my hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and i ordered the guac alicious burger with a caesar side salad my salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it i didnt complain  it still tasted great  im not into red meat so i tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef  but the ran out of black bean and they couldnt get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway the burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldnt get over the taste of the burger because it just didnt have any flavor very saddening i ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat i snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount   we came here twice in one week the second time we ordered the 9 grain deep dish with mushrooms  parmesan and a garlic white sauce was this pizza amazing or what?? i will probably always eat this pizza whenever i come   only down side is slow service it took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked he got the numero uno which was ok but mine had way more flavor
wham 4 stars outta the park the deep dish pizza we had was amazing i wasnt crazy about the avocado egg rolls  but the chocolate chip sundae was superb great service too from maranda  a doll decor is cute ambience is lively recommended
i had the deep dish pizza and it was very good  the individual size was smaller than i expected for $12 but i wasnt starving so it was very filling  our waitress april was very nice and attentive for how busy it was  we had about a 30 minute wait but it was worth it  i cant wait to try it again
my kids who are 3 and 5 ordered the make your own pizza i initially had some reservations but it was actually fun for them and tasted pretty good too id suggest it for anyone looking to do something sorts cool with their kids for dinner
nice place to grab a bite and a beer service is quick  friendly and accurate theyve got a respectable selection of craft beers and the atmosphere is very clean and comfortable good view of the tv from any angle in the bar area watching a buccos game at the moment and the bar itself is full service the baked stuffed spinoccoli chicken that i had was delicious i have no idea why i dont come here more often i should
service is always great at bath  body you know youre going into a scent filled area  i can spend a mint in here   service at this location in particular has always been great even on the busiest of black fridays im guessing good management and good training   bb always asks for an email address  by i no longer get email coupons ?? like for years i get them in the usps  but why ask for email address then?  update i asked about the email coupons to the sales associate she instructed me to call the number on the receipt to let them know im not receiving she also gave me a 20% off coupon because mine i found online was only for online purchases much appreciated
stopped in after leaving a friends house and avoiding going home to do laundry i love bbw  especially the holiday collection the employee was very friendly she gave me her opinions on her favorites and told me about the buy 3  get 3 free holiday sale they had going on she sang and hummed the holiday music being played while i enjoyed browsing and checking out the items love bbw
i usually have good luck at this store  and  aside from goodwill  its where i get my work slacks and jeans i find theres a good classic to trendy clothing ratio here  so i can get a great white button up shirt or basic tees  and peruse the more trendy ish items theres always a great sale  and the salespeople are friendly its a good bargain to get the ann taylor credit card and pay it off every month because youll get lots of great coupons for in store and online shopping
within the last six months  loft has become my go to store for tops my daily commute takes me by the waterfront every day  so its easy to pop into this location and check out their newest inventory loft does a great job of turning inventory quickly every couple weeks  the store has new product with a full clearance section im also signed up for the brands emails so i know when promotions are going on they offer 30 40% off the store every month or so generally around major holidays and also offer 40 50% off clearance pretty frequently  i enjoy the layout and store appearance much better than ross park and robinson ross parks store is very bland  and robinson is currently in a temporary store shopping in an environment with bright fluorescent lights and boring white walls is just terrible  so i enjoy the waterfronts pretty street side location best  the employees at this location are just ok sometimes i am cheerfully greeted at the front door but am generally ignored the entire time that i am shopping i recently had a very attentive sales associate who opened a fitting room for me when my arms were becoming full  but i thought that i noticed someone with a district manager vibe lurking around  which probably encouraged the associates motivation   i actually had a very negative experience at this store during a recent sales event the event ended at 7pm on a weekday  and i rushed to the store after getting off work i hurried around the store and jumped into line at 7:02pm all associates abandoned the registers at 7pm  totally ignoring me and the other two girls waiting in line when i was finally helped several minutes later  the snippy associate told me that the discount may or may not go through that corporate determined when the discount was turned off ok  thats great  but then why did you totally ignore me and your other customers for several minutes? did you want us to not get the discount? i was appalled by the rudeness of both the associate and a manager i spoke with earlier in the evening  who was equally rude about the sharp end time of the discount what made the situation much worse is that a good friend of mine was a manager at loft a couple years ago and told me that ringing up after 7pm would not be a problem hah  well it was a problem at the waterfront location  the only reason that i gave loft 4 stars is because i love the brand  discounts  and quality of product as a whole the staff at this location is sub par and do not reflect the brand well i hope that loft does not lose customers based on negative customer service experiences theyre lucky that i like the product enough to ignore some occasional rudeness
when i lived in los angeles a year and a half ago  p f changs was no great shakes  one of millions of places with good but not outstanding stuff on the menu  here in pittsburgh  its the only chinese place ive found that combines genuinely good service with quality food  not  perhaps  as good as what you can get in las top places  but fantastic compared to its competition here  the kung pao chicken is particularly good  with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles  chicken with lettuce wraps is good too  their fried noodle dish with chicken  whose name i have forgotten  is addictive but has an odd sauce i dont quite like  still  they get the friedness of the noodles right  and there are precious few  ahem  no other restaurants around here that do  portions are small  so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came  the minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees  if you live in la  forget p f changs  if you live in nyc  im sure there are a dozen better places on a single block  but here in pittsburgh  its just about the best place around
i like pf changs  i think ive only been here a total of three times twice it was take out  and i only get vegetarian dishes  but what ive had has been pretty tasty  i would definitely eat here again
i am writing this from the standpoint of someone who cant eat real chinese food because of gluten issues that said  i am loving me some gluten free chinese food here if the gf issue didnt exist  though  why bother when you can get real  honest  non chain great chinese so many wonderful places in the burgh?  but average chinese is better than no chinese if gluten is an issue so thank you mr chang
pretty good stuff  pros: nice bar area cool ambiance nice dishes with good flavors  cons: pricey for just chinese food typically a rather long wait  especially on weekends very difficult to even get noticed by the bartenders once its busy at the bar area  suggestions: lettuce wraps just get this as you meal  lol fat cat martini omg  yummmmm pot stickers
our go to place at the waterfront   we usually order the crispy green beans as an app  they are always fried just right and never really greasy as an entree i always get coconut curry tofu  the veggies are bright and crisp no open pea pods or limp broccoli and the tofu is simply delightful   always consistent never disappointing
my vegan friend  deb  turned me onto the fact that one can dine at pf changs and stay on a vegan diet  vegan friend deb vfd asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps the waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version  but it was never put on the menu warning: even though its vegan  it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt  fat  and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public the vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken  they also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic  eggplant and garlic  and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables  i always loved the fact pf changs offered brown rice that nutty flavor goes so well with their meals  the service staff at changs is always top shelf  ive never had a bad time here and love when we go
we visitied pf changs on sunday with a large group of 20 people  although they had to split the tables   everything was delicious  we enjoyed everything from the spring rolls and chicken lettuce wrapsto the mooshu that they made special vegetarian for one of the gueststo the fried banana dessert  if you are with a group  and you want dessert   get the fried bananas  they come wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and with coconutpineapple ice cream  overall  we had a great time and would come back here again
so i have never been to pf changs before since im chinese and im not a huge fan of eating at chineseamerican restaurants when i can eat delicious authentic chinese food at home courtesy of my momma my boyfriend and i were at dave  busters and werent in the mood for american food  which was what we were all surrounded by so i decided to give pf changs a try   we came on a saturday night without reservations  so we had to wait 45min : luckily time went by fast while i was on my phone looking at the yelp reviews for this place when we were seated  we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly we got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the dan dan noodles and shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce the food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were the calamari was okay i felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more the dan dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful i really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them the shrimp was cooked well and was also good overall i was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if im ever in the mood for chineseamerican food
my daughter  i enjoy  pf changs each time we dine there together i am in love with the chicken lettuce wraps delicious it is always a wonderful experience
ive always liked pf changs and  generally speaking  this location is pretty good i typically opt to sit at the bar  where the service has always been extremely personable and fast  the food is typical pf changs: delicious as one of the chains that provides their nutritional information  its also nice to know that i can go there and eat somewhat healthy im all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings while some complain about the portion sizes being too small  ive always felt like they were perfect i do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of chinese food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard chinese restaurant  but its never bothered me most of the meals are consistently good  freshly prepared  and full of flavor plus  the sauce that your waiterwaitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal ive tried most of the apps  soups  and quite a few of their entrees and have never been disappointed  ive only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that ive gone  and it revolved around service in the main dining area i was there for lunch  and the waitress essentially disappeared im not sure if she had been fired  quit  or what  but she took the order and was never seen again after sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks  etc  i finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server i had never experienced something like that  but i received free food vouchers for a future visit  and luckily i wasnt in a rush that day  so it worked out the experience wouldve made me give the location a worse rating  but one bad experience hasnt outweighed the countless positives: good meals  solid service especially at the bar  and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones  the only other knock on this location   and it applies to every pf changs ive been to   is the insane wait that youll encounter at dinner time my wife and i would actually go there more often if we didnt have to wait forever for a table i love pf changs  but i hate waiting more if you live close enough  get curbside pick up  or just find somewhere else ive yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2 hour wait pf changs  included
used to wait hours for food here a few years ago  second visit in 6 months    kung pao shrimp was very salty  very good service  great wall cake still very good   kids will not leave without having it
singapore street noodles  the end
the service started out slow  but they eventually picked up the pace we ordered the chickenlettuce wrap appetizer  and we enjoyed it for the entres  we had the fried rice and mongolian beef  both of which were delightful i would not mind going back to explore their menu
good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef  bar service was fast and efficent   good value  not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat   fortune was even postive
i usually have fair experiences with this pf changs ive been inside the restaurant  and have used the curbside to go service i finally decided to review this based on my most recent experience  i cant remember her name  but whomever worked curbside to go on oct 30  2013 around 6:30pm deserves a mention she was very nice  and provided us with the exact amount of condiments we listed on the online order form theyre usually stingy with the chili and hot mustard sauces she also gave us a couple other sauces to try not sure which ones  but these were very good   the food here is always in point i like to get the edamame  sesame chicken with brown rice  and the flour less chocolate dome   im reducing a star because of past experiences with service
really awesome food and amazing customer service i really enjoyed my experience here if i am back in the area i will be certain to come back to this location
first  this is a big chain   not my favorite type of eatery  for me  four stars is max for this type of establishment for the simple reason that no one has license to create anything truly unique  however  the chilean sea bass marinated in oolong tea is freakin fantastic  10   now   everyone was happy with their meals and let me tell you it was a ridiculously busy night  servers were threading their way through patrons waiting to be seated and our service was very good  ive been to pfc vegas and pfc nyc   our homestead pfc definitely beats them both  so many great little places to try in the burgh  but i wouldnt resist going back to this particular pfc
we had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was much improved there was no crowd to fight and we werent seated near the door as we were last time as i expected  getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience our service was good and they accommodated our 1 year old nicely i appreciate that they serve steamed veggies on the kids menu   i still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places  but we were satisfied and happy
went here for lunch yesterday with a friend and it was so yummy started out with chicken lettuce wraps and it was totally hitting the hungry spot lol tried chicken lettuce wrap at my places but this place is one of my fave their wonton shop is also full of chicken chunks and shrimps as well which is different bc you dont normally get all that in a wonton soup bowl  by the time we ate the lettuce wraps and our soups  we were almost full love the way their mongolian beef is made here and my friend had the crispy honey shrimp and it was so yummy as well definitely will be back because this place is clean  service is quick  food is delicious  and the price isnt so bad either
this is the fourth changs ive eat ate it was pretty good the food was kinda like it had been previously frozen had a strange texture some of the changs chicken pieces was stuck together and the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was mushy and falling off the chicken overall still pretty good would eat at this one again
excellent beef with pepper and onions waiter made a good wine choice fastest food delivery  less than 5 minutes  honest both meals less than $30  in and out in 45 minutes
meal was about what i expected service was good  not exceptional but good they are trying a new menu with tacos for breast cancer awareness  a nice thought but they should stay in their wheelhouse which is asian obviously stick with what you know
if i had to pick my very favorite chain restaurant  it would be pf changs  im aware that its not authentic  but that doesnt mean its not delicious  we stopped by after some shopping in the area on a snowy friday  and were able to get a table pretty quickly  the hostess and server were both friendly  my husband enjoyed a glass of sake  and i had a mai tai that turned out to be delicious  we split an order of lettuce wraps as an appetizer; they dont custom make your sauce any more which is disappointing  but they did happily provide us with chili paste and hot mustard to doctor it up ourselves  his changs spicy chicken extra spicy turned out great  and provided the extra requested heat  my orange peel shrimp were as good as id remembered  perhaps better because they have some fresh orange slices included as well  we also ordered a great wall of  chocolate  if you like  chocolate cake at all  youll love this one  pf changs consistently provides good chinese in a trendy but still casual atmosphere at a decent price  and im always a fan
i live close by so i go here frequently pretty much for the free wifi and espresso but heres a secret   they dont seem to know what an americano is so often i am charged like 75 cents for a double shot of espresso to which they add hot water upon my request needless to say coffee is not expensive here as you can fill up as many times as needed without being hassled although there regular coffee is undrinkable to my taste pastries are baked fresh and are plentiful there is other foods to choose from ie whole grain bagels are edible and about a buck with no extra charge for butta outside seating and people watching is always a good distraction plus there are all kinds of people who frequent this panera from the very very old and decrepit to the fashionistas taking a break from victoria secrets  ulta  wet seal and the other various shops at this water front location
i love all panera  equally i am def a fan of this easy  better than fast food  time killing eatery  great place for a lunch socialdate with good eats and a good place to sit and talk for a while or to get some work done between appointments  pros: great food; free wifi though some locations are limited to 30 minutes during the lunch hour; seating is always tricky at the lunch hour  cons: pricey for salads  soup and sandwiches; tables should be wiped more frequently even if you have to ask a newly seated guest if they would like it wiped  the tables should be wiped  for petes sake  give a fork with the mac and cheese  not a spoon  lol
i really enjoy panera  and this restaurant meets my expectations i particularly love the asiago cheese bagel  caesar salad  bacon turkey bravo sandwich  tuna salad sandwich  smokehouse turkey panini  broccoli cheddar soup  and iced chai tea latte ive ordered all of these items at this location  and they have been very tasty  i have had this location run out of the side of french baguette once or twice however  last time that occurred  i asked for a bread bowl as a replacement  which i was given for free  ill definitely be returning soon
its the same panera food youve had before  i like the other ones better as they are often  faster at preparing food than this one  that said the food is fine and the staff is nice enough  they have warm cookies for $200  that is a nice feature
this use to be my go to panera bread  when i worked in the area i would stop here before work to grab my breakfast and then stop to get my lunch as well  i was happy when i left the area and moved on to bigger and better things  my waist also appreciated it  those scones are delicious  i recently stopped back here when i was shopping and was pleasantly surprised  with all my new allergies i came in here hoping to get some bread  not knowing  nor doing my homework before i showed up  i asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not  not knowing the answer herself  she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes  ingredients included  after looking through it for a few minutes i was able to select the bread i wanted  they will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now  if you would rather slice yourself  i am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way  yes  its true  it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf  but it is much better tasting
it was my first time here  was recommended by my coworker  however  i was a little unsure as ive read some bad reviews about this place  the first visit was great  the receptionists were helpful and gave me guidance on how to get my dog licensed  everyone seemed happy and talkative    dr bezak was very nice  he had a smile on him the entire time i was there  he was very quick to give me information about anything and everything relating to the dog  overall  i had a good first visit and definitely going back  the only thing that made it didnt earn a five star is that my appointment is at 12:15pm  the entire office have their lunch at 1pm  so i can tell there was alot of hustle to get me out of their asap  i dont mind that it was a quick visit  but i would have liked to had time to ask more questions  if you want adequate time with the doc  consider making your appointment after their lunch
as not only pet owners  but as dog breeders let me say   we love this place  weve heard some bad things from several acquaintances and counldnt believe our earsdr bezak is great and the staff is really friendly and helpful
what can i say  im a shill for target  like another reviewer says  you have to watch the impulse buying here because it is so easy to do  but as for the name brands here  ive never had a problem with them  i bought some woolrich blankets and sheets here that my husband and i have been very satisfied with  the housewares section here is positively unbeatable  my husband rick is an amateur chef and he could blow his paycheck on the kitchen utensils  he particularly likes the michael graves ones  he is also an amateur photographer and he still works with film  so he likes the film development here  me  i also like buying household cleaners and personal items such as soaps  toothpaste  deoderant  etc because the selection is so good  ive also purchased a lot of my casual wear here
oh target  you are big corporate america  but how can i not love you so?  your prices are the best whenever i need household goods like detergents  cleaners  etc  for personal effects such as toiletries  soap  etc  you cant be beat  your cookware and bakeware department is every bit as good as macys  and i see you have the retro tees too  you know:  yes http:wwwdovenetqnetau mahayesgraphicsyeslogofullcircle1jpg boston http:wwwvinylrecordschbbobostonbostonboston 63jpg led zeppelin http:henrikfalckcombloguploaded_imagesledzeppelinledzeppelinalbumcover 716782jpg  we know what retro tee means:  faux aged  catering to boomers and teens  and costing way more than they origianlly did  oh and made in china of course
after working for the rival of target for years  target has become my favorite mega chain store to shop at  although it does not seem to have every single item as other stores im still able to get in and get out in a hurry    depending on the time of day  it may be a task just to find a parking space due to the traffic light at the end of the road  if you dont mind walking a bit  the aisle where the pharmacy sign is on the building usually has spots closer to the front of the store  the only downside i can find for this location is the smell of overly burnt buttered popcorn as soon as you walk in due to the cafe location  i prefer not to vomit as soon as i walk into a store  maybe after about ten minutes in id consider it
this is a really great pharmacy   friendly  quick  knowledgeable  and inexpensive
target is pretty standard if youve been to one of them  youll know largely what to expect from this one that being said  this store is clean  and the deals one clearance can be good just make sure to check the circular and the website  as sometimes additional coupons can be found that the store personnel arent aware of   the electronics department staff are not very knowledgeable  and tried to pressure me into buying a different tv by repeating marketing lingo  but were unable to explain what their claims actually were when challenged on them  so make sure to do your research beforehand if purchasing electronics
target is one of my favorite stores   i just love wandering around late at night when the store is quiet   its just so therapeutic this location is now my closest store  so i drop by pretty often  this store is pretty average inventory and customer service arent particularly stellar but isnt poor either ive generally been able to find what i need here and check out pretty quickly   in addition to the common pharmacy and photo studio found in most targets  this location also has an optical department of the 10 15 locations in the pittsburgh area  only this store and the cranberry store sell glasses i purchased a pair of glasses and sunglasses through target optical three years ago and have been very happy with their product and customer service
i was in and out  and i didnt wait in long to long so im happy
