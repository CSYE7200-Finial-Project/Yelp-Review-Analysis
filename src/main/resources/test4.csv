"Mr Hoagie is an institution. Walking in, it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago, old fashioned menu board, booths out of the 70s, and a large selection of food. Their speciality is the Italian Hoagie, and it is voted the best in the area year after year. I usually order the burger, while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen, all of the other ingredients are very fresh. Overall, its a good alternative to Subway, which is down the road."
"Cold cheap beer. Good bar food. Good service.   Looking for a great Pittsburgh style fish sandwich, this is the place to go. The breading is light, fish is more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fries.   Good grilled chicken salads or steak.  Soup of day is homemade and lots of specials. Great place for lunch or bar snacks and beer."
"Before I finally made it over to this range I heard the same thing from most people - it's just fine to go work on your swing. I had such a low expectation I was pleasantly surprised.   It's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility.   The guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from.   A big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....  Price for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again."
"I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak.  It re-opens on July 14th and I can't wait to take my kids.  The new range looks amazing.  The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course.  Can't wait to experience it!"
"I visited this store several months ago to simply ask about smartphone plans. The agent was pleasant and helpful. I would recommend a visit to this store."
"This place was very good. I found out about Emil's when watching a show called \"25 Things I Love About Pittsburgh\" on WQED hosted by Rick Seback. This place ain't a luxurious restaurant...it's a beer & a shot bar / lounge. But the people are friendly & the food is good. I had the fish sandwich which was great. It ain't in a great part of town, Rankin, but I've been in worse places!! Try this place."
"Wonderful reuben.  Map shown on Yelp page is incorrect. It is actually a different Hawkins.  I'd recommend a call for directions 412-271-9911."
"This is a hidden gem, no really. It took us forever to find but well worth it. It is right across the street from the Rankin Police Station. The menu has a wide selection, I really couldn't decide what I wanted but I went with the ribeye sandwich. I'm glad i did too. Huge sandwich! I added mushrooms, it was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the fish sandwich, he enjoyed it as well. Fast and friendly service. Will definitely be back."
"Another divey place we have been going to for years. My dad's favorite, as he knows the original owners. Certain items on the menu are named after the kids. Huge portions, might have a bit of a wait some nights. Huge burgers, fish sandwiches, salads. Decent service."
"Love my hometown favorites. Cannot beat their fish sandwiches (although I do miss the buns as opposed to the sliced bread...stop that). Always will support Emil's Other favorites include Reuben, Hawkins Avenue sandwich, Chrissy Club."
"This would be my local haunt, if I were ever to relocate to the Pittsburgh area. What a great little place! Such friendly staff, and some damn good eats!   It was so great, that we actually went there twice during our 4-day vacation to catch the Steelers/Ravens game.   They have daily sandwich specials. On Thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand., and the .35 cent wings. Very, very tasty. I'm sorry, but this place kicks Primanti Bros. butt on the taste factor. They have about 8 different types of wings... reg., garlic, and I can't remember the rest - we got the regular, and I was wishing we would had ordered more.  Going back on a Friday night, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n' mushroom.  Wow! That buffalo chicken pizza was awesome.  The other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers. An older gentleman; he seemed to be a regular. I really, really wanted his SPAM t-shirt."
"A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place.   The staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.  We ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!  My advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know."
"Alexion's has been around forever.  The first time I went in there, I was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill.  All of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and I immediately found out why.  MANY, MANY years later, I stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who I was.  THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.  I recall that some of the sandwiches I got there were ordered at a pretty late hour.  Nothing but good things to say about the place, and I wish it was closer to home!"
"What a cool bar/restaurant.. I will no doubt be visiting again.  The service and prices were great.. and the restrooms were clean.   I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious.  The menu consists of typical bar food food, however; theres a few different items on there which stand out on the menu..  A cool bar off the beaten path that is a worth a trip.    Cheers ! !"
"Perfect joint! Don't be afraid as you pull up... It's a nice little neighborhood. Was in town on biz and my hotel was right up the street. Great service, well apportioned servings and unique menu make this place worthy of a check in!"
"Contrary to other reviews, I have zero complaints about the service or the prices. I have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now, and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys, these guys are experienced and know what they're doing.  Also, this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of, just because of my gender. Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry. But here, my service and road coverage has all been well explained - and let up to me to decide.  And they just renovated the waiting room. It looks a lot better than it did in previous years."
"I took my wife's car in for new tires on good Friday. I felt that the prices were reasonable, I didn't feel pressured to buy the most expensive tire, and I was out in less than 2 hours with no appointment."
"Most random location for a mini golf course ever.  This is old school. It's built into the woods (spray yourself for bugs first) right off Forsythe Rd near Carnegie Park.  The candy hut is fun to spend your spare change.  They recently re-carpeted the holes and added a few gimmicks that weren't there before.  It won't knock your socks off, but if you're local, give it a try!"
"This quaint mini golf course is one of the oldest, yet most original and fun locations that I have yet visited.  Coming from Texas, it was nice to see a course located amongst the hilly and woody Pennsylvanian terrain. It can be frustrating that it is literally impossible to make a hole-in-one on most every hole and that the course also makes it extremely difficult to predict the direction on how the ball will follow through and bounce.  The cartoon-like outrageousness of the course proved to give laughs and a fun attempt to play.  Improvements were being made and I will look forward to returning on my next visit to the Pittsburgh area.  I enjoy traveling and visiting new courses and the only reason why I didn't give this location 5 stars is because it was impossible to intuitively shoot the ball for a best effort to beat par."
"I think this place is closed. Their number is out of service, sign is gone and the course has not been maintained. Awesome woodsy mess of a course though!"
"I've been informed by a fellow Yelper that they are just closed for the season, I hope they're right! I find it strange they don't keep their phone number in service with a recording and that they didn't cover the course up to protect it from weather, vandalism, etc. Either way, I can't wait to get my game on in the spring!"
"When I wanted a deck for the back of my home I ended up calling Quaker State Construction. It ended up working very well and they were very polite. I got an estimate and called them to start working out the details of my new deck. Once we got the plans all sorted out they started building my new deck and it was finished with in a reasonable amount of time. I now have a beautiful deck that I can relax and that my family can enjoy. Overall, they did a good job and I would use them in the future for all my deck necessities."
"NICE, suppose to be haunted. In carnegie off main st. Closed Sunday during summer. During school season open some nights until 7pm."
"Awesome historic building high on top of the hill in Carnegie. Home to stage 62, a theatre group that puts on musicals. I recently saw Sideshow and Evita here. Great sound and comfortable chairs, an all around pleasant experience for a pleasant evening or Sunday matinee. Plenty of free parking and at only 18 dollars its a true bargain.   And yes, the rumors are true, this building is haunted."
"Ive pretty much been eating at various Kings' pretty regularly since I was a child when my parents would take my sister and I into the Fox Chapel location often.  Lately me and my girl have been visiting the Heidelburg location. I love the food, it really tastes homemade, much like something a grandmother would make, complete with gobs of butter and side dishes. Prices are low, selection is great, but dont expect fine dining by any means.   Service is hit or miss at pretty much all of them; if you have lunch at any Kings, you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game. Seek out this lady.  My experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.  Im in my 30s now, and very little has changed, other than the Fox Chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look less like a diner, which was a big fail.  Any girl I meet has to enjoy Kings or she's out."
"I heart King's. I've always been a fan and this one was as good as my old one in Monaca."
"I arrived around 10 am on a Saturday morning.  I was greeted by the hostess,who was polite and friendly, and I informed her that I was alone.  She had just arrived, as well, and wasn't exactly sure what was going on yet, so she asked (the manager?) where she should seat me.  After receiving guidance, she brought me to a table towards the back.  It had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined.  So, she quickly got it cleared off, grabbed a rag, and wiped it down.  The waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order.  She was extremely friendly.  I ordered coffee and water, which she went and got while I looked over the menu.  She returned, and took my order.  I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Special - Three slices of French toast made with Pittsburgh's own Jenny Lee® Cinnamon Swirl, two farm-fresh eggs, with bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and your choice of potato (I went with the cheesy hash brown casserole).  I also added an orange juice.  She went and put my order in, while I waited, and came back with it after not too long.   The eggs were cooked exactly how I wanted them, the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious.  I also enjoyed the sausage which was pretty typical.  Kings Family Restaurant featured a very friendly staff, great prices, and tasty food.  I am pleased and will definitely come back again."
"Rocky's has been in business since the 1980s and still going strong.  Their food is good.  Not haute cuisine, pretentious!  Everyday, well prepared and taste bud pleasing home style cooking.  I've mostly gone during supper hours and  and ate in the dining room, but, today I introduced an old friend to \"linner\" in the bar. He ordered the large version of fish sandwich.  Rocky's is famous for their fish.  Three large breaded and fried fish filets, bun and fries for under $10.  Needless to say, he had no complaints and brought home more than he ate. I ordered the meatball grill.  It was delish.  Served on thick cut Italian bread and made \"grilled cheese\" (mozzarella) style.  Meatballs and tomato sauce are both good!  Also, served with fries.  I brought home half the sandwich. Another good meal there.  Friends, mother, and former boss all enjoy their food!"
"Great local bar. Theresa does a great job. Sandwiches are excellent. Recommend meatball, reuben, burger, fish sandwiches."
"Good Luck getting a seat, that's all I have to say. The Gab and Eat is famous and infamous. Diner food is what's up and I like it. When I was a roofing mechanic, we'd meet there before work. Although I'm not sure I would recommend it if you're working were there's no bathrooms. hehe"
"The biggest breakfast in Pittsburgh, as far as I can tell - and delicious and cheap too. I ordered some mix of eggs, bacon and pancakes - and got 2 dinner-sized plates, one loaded with pancakes and the other stuffed with eggs, bacon, and home fries. Oh, and a side of toast. For under $5, if I recall.  HUGE portions, all well-executed; as good as DeLuca's.  I've not had anything besides breakfast, so can't comment on the burger or anything else.  Cramped quarters, and you'll have to wait, but when nothing but monster morning food will do, this is the destination."
"I miss this place. When I return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before. When I think of pittsburgh, I remember cutting morning classes in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of. Honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner, and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint. Go here and you will be happy you did."
"Definitely a greasy spoon! Always packed here and always a wait but worth it. The omelets are really tastey especially with their homemade sausage. I also like the mixed grill.  My parents love their burgers. Took off a star for lumpy booths and really tight tables (your arm gets hit when someone walks past) oh and waitresses aren't very attentive."
"If you're looking for no frills but a great breakfast this is the place. I got the mixed grill half portion and was very full. Make sure you have extra calories for the day because they are not afraid to use butter. Loved the breakfast and would go back. Not much room for sitting down but worth the wait."
"Great homemade hot breakfast sausage and a wonderful family restaurant feel.   Reminds me of the one my parents used to own in Mi.   Have fun finding a table on the weekend :)"
"Yum - freaking - me!  As the other fellower yelpers mentioned - this place is a cash only.    A couple of recommendations:  - Don't eat early in the week  - I don't recommend wearing any tight clothing (no skinny jeans) - you will not be skinny when you leave    I walked in for breakfast one early weekday AM.   The place was packed with locals and regulars.    A very good sign.  My co-worker recommended I get the mixed grill.   I ordered the large mix grill.   My waitress tried to warn me - it is large (very large).    I ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.  Food -   The Mixed Grill comprises their homemade sausage, grilled onions, grilled peppers, potatoes, fried eggs.       Portion -  This should have been a man vs food episode.   I was not going to attempt to eat all the food.   It was really good.  Service -   My waitress looks as if she had been working there for years.   She was fast, friendly, and offered good advice.  Price -   The cost ranges $5 - 10.   I will definitely go back after I buy some new stretchy pants."
"Great breakfast, good price. You might have to stand outside in line though, so I don't really recommend winter time to go. lol. Very friendly service, interesting coffee mugs. They have great deserts and such also. Bring your cash though as they dont' take cards."
"Met my nephew for lunch in Carnegie and he suggested Gab & Eat.   Way to go Justin!  The restaurant is in a strip mall across from the Dairy Queen.  The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn't throw the food when it came!   She also served the fries and Onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   They were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   It didn't factor into my four star rating but I deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   Just kidding Justin!   Love ya!"
"Sadly, I have only been here twice, only due to the fact it is not really close to my home or work. However, when I am in the area, this is a great cheap eats for both lunch and breakfast. Its almost like going back in time to where the old style local diners or Isaly's to get made to order diner style food. Love the eggs made perfectly to order and a variety of lunch offering at extremely affordable prices. I only wish Gab & Eat would move to my neighborhood."
"Great diner. Some of the best breakfast sausage I've ever had. My wife didn't like how her omelet was prepared (it appeared they just took scrambled eggs and folded the omelet ingredients in the middle) but everything else was great including my son's pancake."
"My friend and i stopped in yesterday for breakfast. We originally came to Carnegie to eat at another new breakfast spot, but they had an hour wait and we had some retail therapy to handle stat. Gab & Eat crossed my mind since i had bookmarked it on yelp.. over 2 years ago.   There was a tiny wait here.. about 2 couples in front of us. Finally 2 seats at the bar opened up and we decided to eat there.  Surprisingly we both ordered the same thing.. mixed grill. Mine had sausage links and she decided on bacon.   It was a blast watching all the food being made right before our eyes. Giant club sandwiches, super thick pancakes, eggs eggs and more eggs.. it was a fun time.   The restaurant is literally a hole in the wall but had good customer service and delicious food.   My only complaint is that i ordered my mixed grill with cheese. I thought it was going to be shredded cheddar, but they put 3 slices of american on it. Eh i'll know better next time."
"Great value, close drive to city, not much to do around hotel, its a business park. Carnegie city has a few bars and restaurants."
"Simple Rustic Local Wait that is every Gordon Ramsey review  My experience at extended Stay America was great. The staff was warm and friendly and made it a point to speak to me every morning as I left and when I returned in the evening. They went out of their way to provide A confirmation and point me in the direction of restaurants and nightspots when needed.   If I ever need to utilize an extended stay hotel I wouldn't hesitate to head back there."
"I've stayed at a couple of Extended Stay sites that I found quite satisfactory and this location proved to be just as good. Excellent place to stay while visiting Pittsburgh. It is just a five minute drive to downtown. Location is in a business park area so it is quiet.   The rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator, sink, cabinets and two burners. There is no oven which I expected as the descriptions all state \"full kitchen\" so be aware of that. Also they do not keep the dishes, pots and pans, coffee makers, toasters or utensils in the rooms. If you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in.   The room was clean and well maintained. Cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable. The free wifi is usually fast.   The best part about this location was the staff. The people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile.  I would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it."
"Be warned. Don't expect the best service ever. It's not the cleanest place you've been in either. The decor is soccer jerseys from places and teams you've probably never heard of. It's divey, eclectic, and authentic.   If you're looking for good Irish food and a cold pint, you can't go wrong at the Pour House. Like most of Carnegie's Main St, this is a hidden gem worth seeking out. They have some of the best Irish food I've had in Pittsburgh- the colcannon is awesome and the shepherd's pie is out of this world. If you're not looking for Irish food, then try the grilled cheese- and make sure you ask it with the three cheeses together. It's big and the cheese is thick and gooey. I get it with a side of potato pancakes... Yum.   Also, they have Guinness, Smithwicks and Harp on tap..."
"Best Irish food in the Burgh.  Great bar food too.  The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest, nor the best decor.  But, that's not what this place is about.  It's a town Irish bar and it serves great solid Irish fare and suds to the locals.  And it does it better than anyone.  I go back again and again."
"Recommended. 16 inch pizza on special was cheap. Fast service. Not the best pizza but above average."
"Having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important.  I try to keep it as local as possible, so when I heard about a tailor in Carnegie I was intrigued.  The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.  There is a Latino man in his 20's working when you arrive.  In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing.  He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.  He takes his business very seriously.  While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price.  Really nice guy, please go and support this business to keep him around town!"
"I love LJS and have to agree, service was decent here. I tried a piece of my kid's chicken (I only ever get the fish for myself) and was pleasantly surprised to find white breast meat (same chicken texture as chick fil a). A little grimy dining room, and the bathroom handle is broken 8/2015... It would be nice if they made it an A&W-LJS but as-is still works for me."
"When I moved to the area, Dr. Weinberg was recommended to me by my cousin who had been a client for years. I've had nothing but positive experiences with her and her staff since seeing her two years ago. The team is professional, nice and courteous. I recently had to reschedule an appointment due to a last minute work thing and they were very accommodating. My daughter looks forward to coming to the dentist so that's saying something. I DO wish they would turn off FOX news in the lobby as I'd rather watch paint dry but... nobody's perfect."
"My family (husband and 3 young children) have been seeing Dr. Weinberg for a few years. We've never had an issue. She's great with the kids, even my 6 year old who has autism. Scheduling and rescheduling appts is \"fine\", the wait time is fine, the care is find. Basically I have had no issues, but I haven't had my socks blown off either. It's the dentist, it is what it is."
"Don Don is atleast as good as (although I personally  happen to think better than) the majority of  inexpensive Chinese places best equiped for  delivery and take out.  I've frequented many  similar establishments in different parts of the country, and have also spent a few years in Japan.   Sounds odd, but they have some amazing Chinese  food out there."
"Delicious Singapore noodles and seafood delight. Crispy flavorful crab Rangoon, and cold sesame noodles done well (but could've used a bit more sauce). Excellent real Chinese food, friendly service.  Restaurant ambience: high school cheap date quality."
"Went for breakfast on 6/16/14. We received very good service and meal came within a few minutes.Waitress could have smiled more but was friendly.  I had a Grand Slam... it was more than enough food.  Meal was very tasty... We will definitely go back.  It is a popular Denny's."
"Chose Denny's for a very late (1:30pm) Sunday brunch. No wait. Quickly greeted and served. I ordered the half size of Moon Over My Hammy. It was just the right amount of food for me, and the hash browns were delicious! Only thing lacking was Frank's Red Hot :-) Son and husband very pleased with their meals, can't remember the names but see pic. Patron next to us gave us $5 off $20 check, so our total came to $16! Would go back again for a casual meal."
"I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh, and I find that this gym is not too far from me.  The staff is friendly, the equipment is quite good.  You get two free personal training sessions when you join.  They have lots of weights (which my boyfriend uses) and a decent cardio room.  The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment.  Water is only $1 a bottle!"
"I really like this gym. It is nice neighborhood gym and unlike big gyms they don't have big contracts and they have flexible memberships. Great selection of classes. All the instructors are very good knowledgable and motivating. All the staff working there are super nice. Their selection of the equipment is good too !!"
"This is one of my husband's fave restaurants in town. My husband generally orders Chicken Parm, which is very good. Their sauce is quite good. They serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping -- yum.   I generally order one of their house salads (think it has a specific name, but can't recall off the top of my head) which has mixed greens and I get it with blue cheese, pine nuts and their yummy vinaigrette. A tad pricey for a salad that's just lettuce and cheese (I want to say about $8 with the extras), but really good. (Especially with some cracked black peeper.) I tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the greens & beans.   The place has sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side. It has a comfortable feeling. It also has a solid wine by the glass selection -- better than a lot of places in the 'burgh.   Unfortunately, we've never had dessert there b/c we get so full of bread and dinner!"
"Thanks yelpers for this find. The service, the plating, the ambiance were wonderful. I had the eggplant parmigiana and it was good - but different. It was thinly sliced (like deli meat) and wasn't breaded, it was fried in a very light batter."
"I went there for dinner last night with a client.  This is second time I visited.  I had a scotch and he had a Guiness.  The (-1) is for drink selection. Just stock some better beers and higher end scotch and you're five stars.  We started with the meatballs covered with Provolone and other blessed goodness.  These did not disappoint.  I had a four cheese pizza with sweet sausage and garlic.  It was fantastic.  They have so many good dishes, but I wanted the pizza last night.  I couldn't finish the pizza - way to go big medium pizza.  I finished up with a coffee.  The parking can be a bit of a challenge on the street, but it's a small town atmosphere in Carnegie, PA.  I love the downtown there."
"Yay, I'm a fan but sometimes service is a little slow, it was very good for us this visit.  Go to Papa j's every once in a while but mostly for the White Pizza.  It is the best white pizza I have ever had.  Order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend... it has garlic, spinach, feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top.  It was delicious!  Order fried calamari and it was OK...note to self next time try the calamari roman style.  Like the dinning room with the hardwood floors and bright lighting.    The bar was jumping thou never go to the bar."
"Yay, I'm a fan of the white pizza.  Had take out.    The bar was jumping when I picked up our order.  The white pizza is so delicious...with garlic, spinach, feta, and added some veggies.  Tried the Roman Style calamari, very good better than the fried calamari we had last time."
"We met our good friends from Morgantown here for lunch today and were really impressed with the place itself and the menu.   I had read a few of the reviews ahead of time and the pizza was mentioned more than once so by the time we got there, I was jonesing for it.   It certainly delivered. The crust was great, the sauce wast too sweet and the toppings were sufficient.   Our friend for the baby clams with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bit - as good as the pizza was, this was _much_ better.   We'll return again to this beautifully lit gem in Carnegie PA soon!"
"OK, its Friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. Driving by Papa J's and W says, lets stop in and get a quick dinner.   Advice host that we are in a hurry.  The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!  Just as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  In and out in 60 minutes.  Now that is some good service."
"Great little gem! The food was fantastic was very food and just the right price. The Italian food was amazing, but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepared for giant serving. I had the carrot cake yummy!! Def a place everyone should try."
"This is a regular go-to for me. I love the food and the service. They always have the wine that I like and the food is always delicious. I suggest trying the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store (in the section where you can buy stuff to take home). It is sublime and makes you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness."
"I thought the interiors were very nice.  We stopped here on a Friday night & I was glad they weren't busy because nothing else in the area looked appetizing.    My daughter & I split a chicken parm sandwich, which was really good. Instead of it being served on a hoagie, it was served on thin bread- like focaccia or something.  It was pretty good- little messy.  The desserts looked amazing.  I thought it was pretty cool how you can watch the cooks prepare the food from outside.  The kitchen is situated on a corner with lots of windows.  I would return."
"san francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great. I am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area. I liked Carnegie because u can stroll down Main street and hit a couple places for lunch. I imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night. we ate a lunchtime and it was nice."
"Great place for dinner, drinks or a small celebration.  Papa J's is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we don't have reservations and want a nice dinner out. My husband and I have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy. I have been proved wrong.  We are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes. Unfortunately, the alternate bar/lounge area isn't always open. I really don't understand why more people don't go here.  My favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.The zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. The wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. My husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. Also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. Make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table.   Also, if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event, consider Papa Js. They have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties. We had our rehersal dinner for our wedding here and everyone loved the food."
"Very good restaurant with very good food at a pretty reasonable price.  We had a birthday dinner here with seven girlfriends. The waitress was very efficient , but not very friendly. Our orders came out hot and excellently prepared!  Try the tilapia milanese , it's excellent. Best steamed broccoli Iv'e ever had."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.    I was greeted by a large open (garage style) window, that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  It had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.  Ordered the quattro formaggi pizza.  Quite good!!!  Great balance of cheeses.  Not too rich at all.  Crust was excellent too.  Can't wait to come back."
"Just to start off, we were a party of 12, which is always a little difficult.  We were celebrating 2 birthdays.  We LOVED the food, it was delicious. My husband got a chicken parm sandwich, which is served on a yummy flat bread, and I got the chicken basil pizza ( i got an 8 cut and several ppl tried it) we all LOVED it! It was stunning.  It was made with a very delicious crust, nice and crisp, not soggy (like pesto pizza can get)  The one waitress we had JASMINE, was fantastic!  She was bright, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  She took extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections...   Now... the other waitress.. Mary something was so incompetent...  She was awful and rude.  She missed 2 people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said 'well they didn't speak up!' Ugh.  Then when it was time to sing and cut the cake, my sister in law said 'oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing?'  She came back, cut the cake (all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake) and we didn't even sing!  We were mad!!  The place is so pretty, they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years (according to my father in law) and its really nice.  They look to have a cool bar area with some modern couches and a really sweet look.     So good food, great looking place.. one bad waitress. Prices are about middle of the road for an authentic Italian place, nothing crazy.  All in all, we'd like to go back again, but we want Jasmine!"
"I am amazed that people can write negative reviews about Papa J's.   I have been a return customer since the early 90's and the food quality, and service, are way above average......and especially for this price range.  Kudos to management for maintaining such a level of quality and freshness.   Nothing we had tonight was disappointing, and we over-ordered because each dish was delectable.  The best item tonight was the Mozzarella appetizer \"cradled\" in Bread with an authentic marinara.  The white pizza with sun-dried tomatoes was, as usual, out of this world good.   The scallops special appetizer was phenomenal.  WE WILL BE BACK."
"The menu has lots of choices and the food is great! The Resturante has been expanded so it's pretty large. The new section has door that they leave open during nice weather which makes for a nice ambience! The bread is great and fresh baked daily!"
"spinach/feta cheese salad:  B- pesto alfredo penne :  :A+ Coconut Cake huge piece:  A+ bread small portions:  B Service B  host seemed grumpy, waitress good, but then she got busy . PRICE: Pasta was $15 and the portion smallish more like a $12.99 dish  ARRIVE EARLY ON SATURDAY NIGHT THIS PLACE PACKED after 6pm"
"Many trips to Pittsburgh over 20 years.  First time here.  Had the gnocchi special.  One of the best Gnocchi I have ever had.  Pizza was excellent.  Service was great!"
"Did dinner with my GF last Saturday at PaPa J's prior to going to the Off The Wall Theater. This was the first time we've been to this restaurant. We usually stop a Riley's Pour House across the street for a bite before seeing a show in this town but today we decided to shake it up and do something different.  The place is deceptively larger than it looks from the outside. It was also busier than we would have expected on this particular evening and we got one of the remaining tables which was located near the entrance and the bar. The traffic from both the customers and the staff that flowed past us was a little noisy and distracting and we could tell that's why it was one of the last tables available. But our waitress came by promptly, got us drinks (I had a Hoegaarden and my girl ordered an Absolute water and cranberry), gave us menus and recited the specials of the day.  After viewing the menu for a bit, I decided on the Veal Parmigiano; my date went with one of the specials, a chicken and broccoli gnocchi dish. The plates took about 15 minutes to arrive and the portions were humongous... enough for a filling lunch the next day. My veal was tender and delicious but it's really the gnocchi that left the biggest impression. You could tell that it was house made; it was like little fluffy pillows dissolving in your mouth with each bite. I never tasted gnocchi like it before.  Over all I give PaPa J's a big thumbs up. The food was good, most of the dinning area's seemed cozy, the building itself has a certain charm with its high ceiling and the tables draped in white table cloths give it a pristine appearance. Although I thought it was a bit pricy, I didn't feel as if I've been taken.  Other than the location of our table, it was the pre-theater perfect meal. I only hope get a more intimate table next time we stop for dinner."
"A unique and great find in downtown Carnegie. My fiance and I came here for a weekend lunch and wanted something different from our usual weekend spots. We had the sausage stuffed pepperoncini's as an appetizer (these are never my favorite and were just OK, but the marinara served with them was very tasty, as was their homemade bread), I had a really great wood fired meatball/ ricotta pizza and fiance had the chicken parm sandwich. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I ordered a cannoli on the way out the door and it was FANTASTIC. Not overly sweet, crunchy-chocolate dipped shell stuffed with thick cream and mini chocolate chips. Amazing. We will definitely be back here!"
"I gave them 4 stars for two reasons - 1) they do not have fresh pasta and 2) my boyfriend's chicken Abruzzo was dry. The service was attentive and the bread was amazing. My Carbonara was incredible! The main dining room was a nice grotto style reminiscent of Rome; nice for couples and girlfriends catching up on life. I loved the Montpluciano in a carafe, but don't miss the extensive Italian wine list. We will definitely return to this Carnegie gem!"
"We recently decided to celebrate our anniversary at Papa J's. There is a parking lot in the back of the building and the entrance is on the side. The food was perfectly prepared, served at the proper temperature, and was quite delicious. Portion sizes were quite satisfying. The complimentary bread and oil was excellent. The service was polite and efficient."
"I judge a pizza joint by their cheese pizza and their pepperoni.  While grabbing a brew at Voodoo, my friends and I were feeling a bit hungry.  Thankfully a menu was available and Capri pizza was just across the street.   We ordered a small cheese pizza to pick up.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The cheese was not greasy, the sauce was flavorful, and the dough was chewy yet crunchy... what more could you ask for?  We were really impressed with the quality cheesy pizza from Capri.  Next time we'll try the pepperoni and post an update.  I see yummy pizza in our future.  If you're grabbing a pint a Voodoo and feel a rumbly in your tumbly, order something cheesy at Capri Pizza in Homestead."
"Regarding quality of beverage, this is just your average Starbucks. I can't complain but am not blown away either. However, I really like the location of this shop, which is located in the center of The Waterfront's specialty retail shops. Though in the midst of a lot of retail, the surrounding area is very picturesque with pretty green grass, flowers, and a fountain. Hanging out here is very relaxing."
"I love the location of this Starbucks, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. It's right smack in the middle of clothing stores, the Loews movie theater, as well as restaurants. I love grabbing a mid afternoon latte here on a Saturday while perusing various stores such as the Gap or Loft. I also like coming here before or after a movie for a quick caffeine jolt.  While the drinks are the same as you would find at any Starbucks, the baristas and staff are really friendly, perhaps more so than other area Starbucks.   My drink or choice when I come here generally in the mod afternoon is a venti (or trenta...) berry hibiscus refresher. Yum! It is the perfect afternoon pick-me-up that leaves me feeling refreshed and hydrated."
"Oprah Chai Latte! Great central spot in this out door mall. Staff was pretty efficient and fast."
"Very friendly local dive bar. There is nothing special going on here but friendly folks and cold beer. This is exactly the kind of place I like to hang out in."
"This is smaller store than ones i've seen inside malls, but they seem to have all of the necessities. They have a great collection of candles! My favorites were in the \"relax\" section. Turquoise Sky & Home Sweet Home were great! I'm not a huge fan of food scented candles, but they actually had very nice ones! Apple Pumpkin was great and surprisingly i loveddddd Christmas Cookie! The employees were all helpful."
"Whenever I was at the waterfront I would eat here.  The shakes are good, as are the shoestring fries and baked beans.  The sandwiches are small thin patties of meat so you probably want at least a double.  Overall, pretty tasty."
"The food is good and its CHEAP.  I mean REALLY INEXPENSIVE.  $4.00 for a burger and fries. Add a coke and its like $10.00-$13.00 for two people.  Seldom if ever crowded.   Service can be a tad slow but hit or miss.  They also do breakfast and its a great alternative to waiting at eat and park.  Try the shakes, they're great."
"I heart Steak N Shake. I love the fact that the fries are shoestring, the burgers get to you pretty fast, they're a little greasy, and the food is super cheap.  I visited Steak and Shake on New Year's Eve in preparation for an evening of mostly tame partying. I was unnaturally attracted to their Wisconsin Buttery Burger, which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onions between two buns that have been buttered. Sounds good right?  Well, I get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns had been dunked in butter. The pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me.  I took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burger/fries seasoning on the buns and I literally got tears in my eyes....most likely from the salt overload, but possibly because this was one of the most evilly decadent things I had eaten in a long time.  This is not meant to be a fine dining experience. Service wasn't fast but it wasn't slow. It just kind of was. However, the waitress did get a point for explaining that the order would take X amount of time to all patrons. So I give them a pass for being upfront about it.  Next trip to Pgh is going to feature Steak and Shake - I guarantee it."
"Fast food in a resturant setting.  Considering this food is good and cheap plus you can get food to go.  Must be a reason why this place is always packed."
"I never thought that I'd be giving Steak 'n Shake a 4 star review, but I really enjoyed my dinner here tonight. It just hit the spot!  I was impressed by our waiter as soon as we walked through the door. He apologized for our very brief wait to be seated and for the fact that he was the only waiter working at that time. However, everything was delivered promptly, and he made what would've been just a tasty diner dinner into a great experience.  I ordered a grilled cheese and fries. The grilled cheese was well cooked and filled with tasty, perfectly melty cheese. I love Steak 'n Shake's thin and crispy fries, and these were as delicious as I had expected.  For just $9 for me and my husband, I have to admit that we had forgotten how inexpensive Steak 'n Shake was. Based on the cost, the food, and our fantastic waiter, we'll be back soon."
"Fell asleep last night before I did my review what I can say about this place is their food is good their milkshakes r awesome I had gotten the chicken fingers with fries & a birthday cake milkshake which was delish we got seated pretty fast & our waiter was very polite & professional"
"As far as I'm concerned, Filene's Basement is good for two things: cheap dresses and cheap accessories.\r \r As a young performer, I need good-looking dresses for frequent auditions -- and I need a couple, so I'm not wearing the same thing every time. The dresses on the second floor usually range from $30-60 and are good for over a year. It can be hard to find a full-length dress that's not reminiscent of a prom dress, but their selection of cocktail-length dresses is ample.\r \r As far as accessories go, Filene's tends to have cheap versions of popular trends. If I feel the need to stock my wardrobe with a transient fad, Filene's is the place to go."
"Even when we didn't have a car Filene's Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront. I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still, I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later.   I kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the usual department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains AND quality.  I like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's challenge and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . . Filene's was still up and running in June 2007 when I left town."
"This is probably my favorite store in Pittsburgh, for the selection and variety of discounted designer clothing. Other stores carry the same stuff but for much, much more, and it's hard to find all the stuff that the Basement carries in one spot. (Yes, I admit that the 'burgh has some cool stores.) I would do most of my clothes shopping here if I were here more often."
"Well, the experience did not start well. When we walked in the singing we heard was NOT good. Oy was it not good... Thankfully, it (mostly) improved from there.  So there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis. So each was on for an hour and off for half. Of the 3, two were really good. Good singers, good piano players, and very funny. The third guy, well, not so much. Piano skills were fine. But his singing was not. When he sang in his range, he wasn't too bad actually, but too often he reached for notes that he couldn't get to or forced things that just weren't going to happen. Often his jokes fell completely flat. Luckily the other two usually did most the talking.  They played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested (Closer by NIN as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight). We requested Britney Spears' Toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it, it turned out REALLY good. That takes some serious talent to pull off. If they didn't know it (like Toxic) they'd find it and play it. They played a wide variety of stuff.  Part of the experience is based on the crowd. We had a couple larger groups (there on a Thursday night, so smallish group in general) that they interacted with a lot, providing some running jokes and comedy. Of course, that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.  My friends were BIG fans of the super cheap beer specials. $1 drafts from Rock Bottom next door. The waitress wasn't great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isn't that easy to navigate. The bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast.  If in the Waterfront for a night out, definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes. Having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun."
"While we were in Pittsburgh for the Winter Classic on New Years Day, we figured we'd see what the area had to offer for NYE. My wife and I, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up Sing Sing in Homestead. It's apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. When it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. The only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. Pretty cool.  Sing Sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the Rock Bottom Brewery and serves a selection of RBB's in-house brews and shares a similar menu. There are no TV's, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. This place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. Mind you this isn't a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to Dave and Busters. I'd say Sing Sing holds about 150 people seated.  This particular night they were hosting a (shocker) NYE's party. For $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. Again... Pretty Cool.  There were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently I missed the sax). There was plenty of crowd involvement. As in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. The larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. I put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. Their rendition of Toto's Africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the Theme from TV's \"Growing Pains.\" I was sold from that point on.  I will take this time to note that this is NOT a family friendly joint. I'm not sure if it was 21+ only but I certainly wouldn't bring anyone too young to drive. A good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.  Drinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. I think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (RBB doesn't brew anything I particularly enjoy so I stuck with rum and cokes). All and all my bill wasn't scary and I'm not used to that on Dec 31st. Waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. No complaints there.   The only down side to everything was group seating as you're sitting at 2-top cab tables. It was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in Homestead. Understandably NYE has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hours for a cab because, as we found out, Homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives.   Ooops!  All and all a good time and someplace I'd certainly return to if for any reason I'd be back in Pittsburgh... as long as I have a car."
"So.Much.Fun!   I WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop.   This is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night.   Keep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits!   The guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it.   My favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!).   The birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go!"
"Had an absolute blast!! Great for any crowd, any occasion, any age! Ashley the waitress was AMAZING"
"Picture Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" DOUBLED mixed with beer, a rowdy crowd, and comedy - Welcome to Sing Sing!  A unique musical experience found in Homestead.  If you're looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer, come on in!  Serving food and brews from Rock Bottom Brewery, Sing Sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two (or more) amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests.  They'll play anything you'd like, for tips of course.  Wanting to hear Britney Spears?  Toto?  Duran Duran?  Yep, they play that... new or old.  The crowd makes the show, so make sure you come ready for a good time.  If the crowd is dead, it's harder for the Guys to get a reaction.  If you're wanting to have some fun, it can be a GREAT time!  It's the perfect place for Birthday parties - especially if you want to embarrass a friend.  The guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty.  For being a good sport, you get the coveted Sing Sing bumper sticker.  Now who wouldn't want that?  Dueling Pianos and brews... time to Shut Up & Sing Sing!"
"First time here tonight and I must say I wasn't sure if I wanted to go. It seemed like it might be ok but nothing special but I decided to go with friends and man did I have a blast. The $7 door charge was great figuring u had music from 8 until probably 2 am ( we left shortly after 1). The food was not super but good prices reasonable. The beer left something to b desired as they r a micro brewery so u can only get their crafts. I asked for something similar to yeungling but what I got was nothing like it. The musicians were great they made this place awesome. We will b back and this may b our new Pittsburgh hangout"
"My friend is a piano teacher, so I took it as a good sign that Sing Sing would be quality stuff. It was her birthday, and I didn't really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong.   It was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they're covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It's obvious they've been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it's rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, \"Rubber Ducky\" and \"Gangsta's Paradise\" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for \"anything else,\" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like \"yinz\" instead of \"you.\"  I saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there's not even an intermission. I've read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend's birthday. \"I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,\" he said when she requested him.  There were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can't laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.  Luckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.  Sing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbräuhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list."
"Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays.   Shut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs.   My big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses."
"Waterfront Lowe's beats Monroeville Lowe's for lawn and garden.  Hate to admit it, but it's true."
"Excellent wings and sandwiches, generally good food otherwise, and fair prices-- nice casual place. The service can be a little slow due to how popular the place gets at peak times."
"Great atmosphere and even better people----wait staff was very friendly and the French Onion soup was amazing....Definetly recommend the home made chips...  Great Bar in the up and coming Homestead area.....Highly recommend"
"We're always looking for non-chain restaurants by the Waterfront (they do exist...), and this has become a favorite. I've had the Hot Roast Beef & Fries and the Corned Beef on Rye, and both were delicious. Every beer I've had here has been ice cold, and the service has been strong too. It's a great place to watch a Pirates game too."
"Food is good here. Great beer selection on tap. Sometimes the beer is on the pricey side. What I want from a neighborhood bar is a neighborhood special. Pinkerton is one of the best sandwiches. Good place to watch football, hockey, baseball."
"One of my favorite local eateries. The mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite, I wish I could purchase it. I am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great & reminds me of a fatheads sandwich. Food portion is great. The only complaint I would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side, as usual in most local bars. Friendly service, will continue to frequent with my family."
"We recently ordered fish sandwiches from here. They were HUGE! We did get the large, but it was so big we could've just shared one.   Was not over fried. The French fries were hot and also very good. We will definitely be going again to try something different."
"Went to Dukes last week. They have really renovated the place, and added a lot of large screen tv's. The best part, tho, is the vast improvement in draft beer selection. I counted 46 beers on tap. If you are a beer head and are at the Waterfront shopping are, this is definitely one of your best choices.  The food is above average, and the selection is common pub fare."
"My boys and I stopped here for dinner one night. It was cold and dreary outside but warm and homey in here.  Our server was extremely nice. The menu had lots of options. They are kind of known for their potato soup so that's what I had. It is very good. It's a very thick soup that is velvety smooth. I would definitely order it again. It was perfect for a rainy night.  My youngest son had chicken tenders. They looked a little over cooked but I tasted one and it was good. The coating was crispy and the chicken was juicy. My older son ordered wings with their house made sauce. It was good but not spicy enough for him. I thought it was good and would order it the next time I go."
"I love the games here but can't go very often since they don't rotate new games in very often.  The place is usually pretty clean.  Pool tables often have a wait on the weekend but are some of the better ones you'll find in the city.  Food is just \"ok\" Drink prices are fair but not great."
"The usual fun center.  You can play games using a play card which you purchase there.  Game prices can be confusing- - -  2.3, 5.7, 9.9 credits, etc.  The arcade can be fun if you bring some friends.    Almost every game is a ticket game and there are few innovative or exciting game choices.  I didn't eat there, so I can't rate the restaurant part of Dave and Busters."
"We came here on a Saturday night and luckily it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun. Too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would come back. Hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion."
"I love Dave and Busters!!  It is a great place to go when you are wanting to have a great time with a great group of friends.  If you find you and your friends bored on a Friday or Saturday night, come to D&B and win some prizes!!  It is pricey though, so bring some major moolah"
"Not a cheap night out you will end up spending money here.  But it is busy fun entertaining and a good time out.  I ate dinner here and the food was great i also played pool and the arcade games."
"My friend and I both had Friday off so we decided we wanted to do something more interesting than just hit up a bar on Thursday night. We settled on Dave and Busters. I went on Facebook and printed off a coupon for buy $20 get $20 in play free (we split the card, it took us about 1.5-2 hours to get through)  The games weren't *quite* as fun as I remembered, but it was still a good time. The place was far from crowded, and when a machine was out of tickets, it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. When we did, the team at D&B could not have been more accommodating. To apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing.   I think a lot of companies (I'm looking at you, American Airlines) could learn a lot from D&B. It cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games, but it made our experience so much better.  Drinks are half-price after 8 or 9, my Tropical Mojito was awesome! My friend and I are definitely planning on going back on a Wednesday for half-price games AND half-price drinks."
"Visiting from Toronto, I was really impressed! The amount of tickets to be won was incredible. We usually got 200 tickets per play on average. Compared to Playdium here, that's awesome considering I'd win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets. The food is great, the place is clean and the games don't feel greasy or nasty from all the food."
"I still love this place!  I spent my 36th birthday at D&B's and it was a wise decision!  i had so much fun, and so did my guest!  I got a very attentive serving staff, and met up with many helpful servers!  I believe that service has improved, so I bumped this restuarant up to 4 stars!  No five stars yet, because I've still as of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it!  It's still worth the visit, and is a lot of fun for a reasonable price!"
"I'll have a biased opinion of any place like this. What could be wrong with playing old and new school games, drinking, and eating all at the same place? The one thing I can think of is the price. On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you \"donate\" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! But honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available.  In regards to the games, there's a plethora for your enjoyment. Although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times I've gone I've gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (Mario Kart, anyone?!). Either way, it's a really fun place that you'll most certainly have a good time at."
"This is a really fun way to spend an afternoon. After several visits here, I've found a couple games that are easy to win and score you lots of tickets, and others that are just a blast to play. We did really awesome last time we were here, and their prize room is full of some pretty neat stuff.   Their food is not too bad. I've only ever eaten here once, and it wasn't that memorable, but I didn't hate it. I did like that they have a bar, and they had my favorite beer on tap, that was nice.   Like pretty much any arcade I've ever been to, there are things that are a rip off, and occasionally something won't work properly. That really irritates some people but I figure no arcade is perfect. At least none that I've ever been to. The most irritating thing for me is that some of the games have a call button on them that signals an employee to come assist you, and I kept hitting the button with my leg or something, so every once in awhile someone would randomly appear at my side and ask if I needed help, and I would be really confused. haha.   We went here with my husband's family on Thanksgiving, and we had a total blast. The whole place was pretty empty, and I felt really bad for the employees that had to work that day, but it was nice for us!"
"Chilling with Kimberly Vasil, Mikey & Big Bob for the 96.1 Kiss FM Listener Appreciation Party.  Kiss really knows how to throw a bash- $10 power cards, free t-shirts, megaphones & basketballs, appetizers & n/a beverages...  Apps are flowing & delicious, everybody is happy...  Nice Bash Kiss FM...!"
"I've probably only been to 3 Dave & Buster's in my life, but this is probably my favorite one. It's a lot bigger and has more variety of games than the other 2 I've been to, though they pretty much have the same games. The prizes are also better here, and the ticket exchange rate for the prizes seemed a lot more fair too. Definitely take advantage of the half priced games on Wednesdays!!!  I don't come for the food, since it's very average. With all these good restaurants close by, why don't just eat somewhere else and come for the games?"
"im a fan  I went to this one October 2014. I was in town for my favorite nfl team the colts steelers game. I went to the game and had fun in the city.  I went on half off Wednesday. I really had fun with the games. im a young man and I like old Nintendo games. I like all kinds of games. the skee ball game acted up.  I had fun  I will go back. not to this one because of the miles to far I will go to the ohio one.  im a fan"
"I gave D&B 4 stars because our waiter was very geniune and nice! The place has definitely changed over the years, becoming a very pricey venue. The food was mediocre. The fries were cold and the sliders were subpar, almost like White Castles from the freezer section in most grocery stores. My buffalo wings were rather tough. As for the games, they were mostly the same, but included a lot of the newer 'app' style games like flappy bird. Skeeball and Free throw were still fun, along with the coin drop machines. But, wow, we went through $50 of games really fast. The gift section is full of fun tchotchkes and prizes if you pay enough to rack up the points! Nevertheless, it is still a great destination to celebrate any special occasion with family, friends or coworkers."
"Fresh and good...but I was starving.  I will obviously be returning since I have such a favorable memory.  I must say, though, my spicy chicken sandwich was fresh-out-of-the-fryer hot and very crispy while my bun was toasted.  The french fries were also fried to an artery clogging perfection."
"Ordered pizza and wings from here with delivery.  The pizza was pretty decent but the wings were just so-so.    The prices were pretty good and delivery was quick.  I'll definitely order pizza from here again."
"Nobody has reviewed this in a while, but I am surprised at the lack of lovin'!  My husband and I ate here a few nights ago and we liked it a lot.  We started with drinks--he got the house-brewed Portland Wheat and said it was quite a good beer, and I got a mixed drink (Red Rock) that was also tasty.    He got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and I got a mahi sandwich.  Both great--the fries and side salads are good here too, and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  There were tons of things on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying.  We are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake, come on!  Our food and service was great.  They had the Penguins game on all the TVs in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game.  Seriously, what's not to like!?  I'm thinking this place has changed for the better since the last review a year ago... :)"
"This is literally the first place I went when I first came to Pittsburgh - and I loved it. Hearty, full-sized meals, lots to choose from, and not too crowded or noisy. Although, for the sake of full disclosure, I didn't sit at the bar and I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on that. I go back to Pittsburgh often and Rock Bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night. Really, I have no complaints about this place so I'm surprised by the few low ratings here."
"Pretty good! Excellent beer sampler - bargain!  Veggie burger awesome. Onion rings awesome. Fried Mac n cheese was delicious - crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. Carrot cake was monstrously huge and delicious."
"First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.  Now, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.  Service was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.  Beer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.  I REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.  Verdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back."
"Beer selection was good, but they were out of the ones we wanted. 4 of the 6 people in our group ordered steaks all of them were cooked to their satisfaction. The bourbanzola was a good addition. Defiantly a place I would go again. Joe, our server, was awesome and super friendly."
"Rock Bottom is a nice hangout place. Often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise. Great if your out to see a band, but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you.    Depending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booths and tables. It's alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area. The bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. Complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender. When the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining. The view however...not so picturesque, just the entrance to the Improv. Which hey, that could be the perfect seat if you're stocking the local comics!    The bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills. On any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen TVs surrounding the bar area.   The menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. They have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. The bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a Bourbon based glaze and Gorgonzola cheese. Appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp. Steaks, pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu.   On Monday the burgers are half off...I don't think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special. However, if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gifts and specials.   http://www.rockbottom.com/MC   Needless to say I have a fun beer glass collection thanks to Rock Bottom...LOL!   Now everyone favorite part about Rock Bottom's Beers!  The in house brew master keeps it interesting with a rotating variety of frothy yummy to try along with the consistant favorites of Ale, IPA's, Rotating Darks and Kolsch.   Stop by on Thursday nights for a colorful game of trivia where teams battle it out in a game of intelligence and drinking skills!"
"We've all had this happen to us - you go past a place one hundred times and never go on. Then, once you finally do, you realize how many opportunities you wasted!  Rock Bottom is definitely a solid bar. As a microbrewery, their beer list is full of house brews. There are better beers in the world, but there are a lot of worse beers out there, too.   What really makes Rock Bottom standout, though, is the food. My girlfriend and I shared an order of nachos, and it took everything we had to finish them. They also make a mean soft pretzel.   The Waterfront may not be the most convenient thing to do while in Pittsburgh, but no trip to the Waterfront, is complete without a bite and a drink at Rock Bottom."
"Rock Bottom on Thursday nights is the place to be. Team Trivia starts at 8pm and it is free to play. The DJ (Todd) is great.   The food is good, but the Ball Park Pretzels with Spicy Spinach Cheese dip is the best. The wait staff is generally pleasant and on top of things, a few servers are excellent. I am not a beer drinking so I haven't tried the microbrews but the mixed drinks I've had have been good and a few of thier specials perfect.   On nights that are not trivia nights, Rock Bottom is quiet and a good place for a small to medium party. Larger parties will usually be split into two tables.   Overall, an enjoyable place at which I am a regular."
"So I have not been to one of these in awhile since I normally have an aversion to chain restaurants, but since I was with colleagues on travel for work and they chose this place I went along.   First surprise: decent beer.  I remembered the normal RB Brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles, including a very good imperial IPA that for $5/glass cannot be beat.  Second surprise: pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than I expected.  Recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna - both were great.   Service was a little slow (not sure why) so a 4-star review is downgraded to 3.5. I'll be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh for work."
"The beer is good. Their light beer, Lumpy Dog, is very good-- doesn't taste like a light beer. When I was pregnant I became quite a fan of their root beer floats, too.  As others have noted, the pretzels are really good. I'm not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband likes it. Veggie burgers are always good, too, though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order, say, the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger. Long, long ago, when I used to go to the Rock Bottom in Boston, there was a hot mushroom / sundried tomato / cheese dip on the menu that was fantastic... if they resurrect that I will gladly add another star!"
"I've always been pleasantly surprised with the food I've gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say \"surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \"chain\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \"bar-straunt\" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).  But besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!  I've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.  I definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more."
"Happy hour at Rock Bottom, 2 thumbs up!  Good prices, the pizza is delicious, drinks are a few dollars off the regular price, good service, and the atmosphere is always casual and fun."
"Rock Bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl.  As expected, the bar was lively, the food was good, and the service was accommodating,  The beers are better than Church Brew Works and the bar was populated.  The bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl.   I vote for Rock Bottom as the anchor store of the Water Works."
"I haven't been to Rock Bottom in years.  Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it's been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.    As I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.  When we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest.\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.    During our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!  My only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won't deter me from returning."
"I very much enjoyed my first visit here. I got the Turkey Meatloaf and it was really tasty. It's more sausage than turkey. The cheesy mashed potatoes were excellent. The star of the night was the appetizer, the artichoke and crab dip. It was awesome. My only complaint was I ordered a Red Ale and they were out. I had the Curmudgeon instead and it was very good, but still."
"First time I was here I had chicken quesadilla's and they were bad.  We went again last weekend. I had the chicken avacod sandwich.  It was very good.  No fat in the chicken.  Just a mess to eat, but still awesome.   Also had the chocolate stout cupcake, it was amazing."
"Thanks to the staff here For being so friendly and Cool with our whole mess*  *rock bottom allowed our bachelorette party to eat and drink and hang after dave and busters orphaned us"
"Went to Rock Bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased. My coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer. The waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla. If you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's - the filling tasted like that and I am a big fan!   Mondays are half off burger days and I tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup. It was delish! The ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy.   The prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on Monday, it's totally worth it. I think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but don't expect for pay under $10 for a sit down.   I felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive. The service was quick and I think you can get in and out in under an hour."
"Mostly come here for the beer and sports. Fun place!"
"I go to Rock Bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer, so I was really really excited to have my bridal shower there.  My maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant.  My MOH and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with.  My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  Not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  It would have just gone to waste!  Also, not at all related to the shower, their trivia night is super fun!"
"I'm giving 4 stars mostly because of the beer....large selection & decent prices.   The food is pretty good, but nothing to rave about.  The menu has a good variety, and everything I've tried has been good.  Portions are large.    One side of the restaurant is the bar & bar atmosphere....with several TV's & 2 pool tables.  It's very wide open with extremely high ceilings.  The other side is more for families or people who aren't concerned about watching sports.  In general, it has a relaxed atmosphere.  I've always had quick & friendly service.    I love the whole Waterfront area....so much to do!"
"I'm not much of a beer drinker, but my fiancee is a major enthusiast, so I agreed to tag along.  I'm glad I did!  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection, and helped me to pick one I would love (the kolsch was very crisp, light, and drinkable.)  The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.  My only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy, and I spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch.  Not sure I would make the hour+ trip to Pittsburgh again, but if I found myself in the city, I may just stop by."
"I'm a regular here since their kitchen is open late and it's a good option after movies. Their nachos is pretty good. I also tried their burger and chicken sandwiches and they're good as well.  I think the only thing I did't like is the steak taco appetizer. It was too sour and kinda tasteless."
"The Cajun Pasta I ordered was just spicy enough to keep me sipping my Rock Bottom IPA. It may be a chain but I always get that microbrew restaurant feel when I'm here. They could upgrade the quality of the servers but I've never had a really bad experience with the service."
"I really miss the Northstar Amber but the specialty beers are always good.  Food is excellent and the service staff is friendly."
"Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience."
"I have to say that I've only been here when it was very busy. I found the service fairly quick and any of the food I've had has been delicious. I went there tonight and there was an issue with my food. Without going into detail, I will say they handled it wonderfully. Our waitress Mallory was very kind and she was quick to fix the problem. I had the salmon for the second time and it was just as amazing as it was the first time. I had one beer that's similar to a blue moon and that was good too. I would go back again!"
"The staff here is very nice and the set up has TVs all around the family so enjoy mostly all sports, the music is nice and pretty mellow and the place is very spacey and the prices are pretty reasonable. And most importantly is the place seems to be kept clean at all times."
"Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.  NOTE: There aren't too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose."
"I've never been crazy about the food here, but my friend likes it, so I do eat here once in a while. We stopped in last night and I had the chicken finger appetizer with fries. The food was a little overcooked and nearly tasteless. The ranch dressing was barely good enough to make up for it.   My friend had the mac & cheese with chicken and bacon, which is what she orders just about every time she's there. It looked delicious and the portion was huge. I'll be trying this dish next time we're there.   We've also had the Ball Park Pretzels in the past, and they're really good.   I'm giving 4 stars because the service was great, there's outdoor seating, and the Berry Bash Sangria was delicious (if expensive). We'll be back."
"Every time I've been here the food has always been delicious and the service has always been very exceptional. My go to is the Laredo burger and the Mac n'cheese as a side. They Mac n' cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic! I've had a few other menu options as well that have been superb. The beers on tap are always great. My newest favorite is the First! Pumpkin Ale.   One thing I really appreciate about Rock Bottom is that they aren't one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you're done eating. The food comes out fast (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's never any rush. I was just at Rock Bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. We got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the cinemas. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.  My only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain.   Overall I definitely recommend eating here if you're in the Waterfront!"
"I am not a fan of chain restaurants typically and had to slowly break my boyfriend from wanting to eat at chain restaurants all of the time. The one chain that I can't break from is rock bottom.   Their beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol).   As far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10.   Almost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well.   Another item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good.   They also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones.   Their side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum!   I usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless. Which turned me off to trying new items there. Plus I am just too in love with the Baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else.   Service is always great, the bartenders are friendly... I love this place. Ask about their rock bottom rewards !"
"I always enjoy Rock Bottom. Standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well.   I prefer the bar seating as to the dining room, but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos.   Nachos, nachos, nachos. Truly the best in the area. Great burgers, chili and salads. Really...I don't think I've had a bad meal here. Nice outdoor seating in the summer.   This is a great place to watch a game or just hang out. Iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold.  I know they have other cocktails here, but I can't order them at a beer place. I've seen them and they do look good, but I'm stuck to the beer selection.   They have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week.   Service is always great whether there are two or 10 of us."
"We have been going to Rock Bottom for sevesrl years and Love it! It is our go to place, when we want a nice meal, in a nice atmosphere,  with good service! We have had 1 maybe 2 not so great visits but for the most part, service is EXCELLENT and the food is consistent!  After leaving another restaurant (just trying to do something new for a celebration) because of poor service, we were greeted and seated in a few seconds!  Our server was at our table within seconds even though she had a large (10 to 12 guests) Group at the table near us. We had our drinks in minutes and were checked on twice within 5 minutes. Our food came out rather quickly and was delicious! Our server was very attentive and social. As usual, a save by our go to place! I know we will retun here again!"
"On a Friday I went to Rock Bottom with some friends for their happy hour which takes place from 4-6. Our server was a spunky brunette who was very attentive and even let us sample as many beers as we liked until deciding. I ultimately decided on the Pom-berry Cosmo which was excellent. I also got the ball park pretzel which is amazing. During happy hour it's only $5 and you get two big pretzels served with this delicious cheese dip. My friends got the nachos, the quesadilla, and the artichoke cheese dip. Everything was very tasty."
"First, I have to say that I've been here twice in the past few months, and each time was with a very large group (one group of 20, one group of over 30) on a weekend evening and I'm thoroughly impressed with the friendly, efficient and professional manner in which the accommodate groups. Whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks, they are flawless. Lots of other restaurants could learn from them. Impressively, even with providing separate checks to such large groups, they chose not to add gratuity (and we obliged with good tips), l managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time, and processed payment of the checks in no time at all. Bravo to this restaurant's management and service staff, it's top notch.  That being said, the food and beer aint all that bad either! Fish & Chips, chicken mac'n cheese, salmon bites, guacamole and the Maker's Mark burger are all quite good, as are the beers (the Kölsch is my favorite!)."
"Great bar. Great atmosphere. Great food. Cool place to be.  Definitely one of those places you could keep going back just because it's so chill and it's a great place for friends to just enjoy some drinks and eat some good food. Nothing too too spectacular by any means but satisfies the taste buds. Their apps are the best part and the highlight of the restaurant, in my opinion. The nachos can be split among 4-5 people easy. Lots of toppings and yummy all around."
"Great american style bar food with quite a lot to pick from the both the food and drink menus. They are also great at accommodating large groups and these are one of the few places that allow you to call ahead to reserve a spot. Been here plenty of times with my group and we enjoyed it every time."
"I am a FAN of rock bottom.  This is my 2nd time here and i can say i am a FAN.  We went on a Saturday night after a day at sandcastle.  The wait was 45-60 mins for a table of 5 which was to be expected on a saturday evening.   Our server wasn't the best in my opinion.  She was very friendly and some what attentive but it definitely took awhile to place our orders in for our drinks, appetizers, and meals.    Since we were all hungry, I ordered us the nachos.  They were AWESOME.  Very happy and pleased with that selection. My sister ordered pretzels which were pretty good,but the clearly had TOO much salt on them.  The cheese dip that came with the pretzels however was AWESOME.  Definetly pleased with our selection.  We placed our order, which came out in a timely fashion.  Everyone was pleased.  The prices for the meal were about average for everything that you got.  I got the the margarita pizza which was pretty good.  My wife got jalpeno burger with fries.  My son got the kids pizza.  My sister and her husband got the seafood taco with shrimp and crab i believe.  The best part of this place is that they brew their own beer here.  Everyone got a honey beer (can't remember the exact kind) but it was 7.75 for 25oz which was a fair price i think.    All in all, its def a place worth going."
"Good beer, food and service. Arrived on a Wednesday night for business and sat at the bar. Bartender was attentive and nice. Food was great. I had the Bison Prairie Burger. It was cooked perfectly and the flavor and fries were great. I'll be coming here again on my next business trip."
"They did a good job accommodating a large group. Mac N Cheese with chicken and bacon was good. In house beers were moderate and selection was limited. Good service, franchise-ish ambiance, nothing extraordinary but easy enough."
"I'm not someone that's mechanically inclined, so I can't say for sure that the deal I got was a good one. But that said Alan and the crew at Master Muffler certainly appears to have done a great job fixing my car to a degree better than I expected and at a price much lower than I was expecting. And with a great warranty on their work I feel comfortable knowing that if there is a problem I'll be covered. I would absolutely recommend them to all my friends."
"The Improv Comedy Club at The Waterfront is the best comedy club in Pittsburgh because there is only one other one and this one gets more famous comedians. I go there just about every other week.  Pros: Great comedians all year round! The food/drinks are very good and the wait staff is wonderful! The Improv is a great venue for upcoming and new comedians, I always see new, local talent opening for national comedians. In one show you will see 1-2 local comedians, and 1-2 national touring comedians. The Improv has a nice environment inside with general admission seating (first come, first serve). The EMAIL LIST is essential in order to receive free ticket packages and perks, as well as reminders of upcoming comedians!  Cons: Prices can be steep (it is expensive/difficult to be a regular). Food and Drinks are not cheap (no specials). Expect to pay $15- $40 for tickets depending on the headliner with a two item minimum. Waiting in line before the shows wouldn't be bad if you weren't forced to stand outside in any and all weather conditions. If it is raining and you'd like a good seat, you will pay the price.   Overall: This 21+ venue is a great place to spend a night out with friends or loved ones. You may buy tickets in advance online/phone or buy your tickets at the box office at the location. I highly recommend joining the mailing list to receive free tickets! Check the calendar for upcoming shows and open mic nights during the week! Support local comedy, and enjoy The Improv at the Waterfront!"
"I always enjoy a good comedy club and though I'm a loyal Helium fan, I gotta give props to the Improv near Pittsburgh. They chose a great location, with surrounding restaurants of all genres and fun bars and shopping.   We bought tickets to see a comedian I had never heard of (he was decent) for $25 each with a two item purchase minimum. I really dislike that rule but you can't really get around it.   The only thing I didn't like, aka hated, was having to wait in line outside before the show started. It was freeeeezing! They should put heaters outside. seriously."
"You know that place where you've never gone, then you go, then you're going all the time? Well the Improv for me is one of these places.  I am thankful to have a venue to see some of my favorite comedians.  Most recently I saw Hannibal Burris, Tommy Johnigan and Doug Benson. All three performances were a hooting good time.   On Saturday afternoon at 2:20pm I went to see Doug Benson I was accompanied by my boyfriend. You may know Doug Benson from the hit documentary \"Super High Me.\"  Ok so:  PROS  Wonderfully talented comedians  Clean bathrooms  Pretty wait staff  has Coors Light on tap ( 5.75 per draft)  Every seat in the house is a good seat   Cons: Expensive drinks Expensive food  Flavorless food  Dirty silverware  Far from my house  Mayo with french fries   Any way, I have enjoyed all my visits to the Waterfront.  I can certainly see myself seeing more shows at the Improve.  The club is well maintained and the wait staff is friendly.   Bring a lot of money with you, you're going to need it. I don't know if it's true everywhere but at this Improve there is are 2 item person, minimum order requirement.    They served us warm Mayo with our fries, what is this Holland!!! That sh*t was gross. It was both gross and also unusual.  Anyhow to catch a comedy show at the Improve is a pleasure."
"This was my second visit to the club and it was still a blast. My girlfriends bought tickets for John Witherspoon for my bachelorette. We were all looking forward to it and it was hilarious! He was wonderful.   The servers were fantastic. They always came back to check in on us and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink. I suggest the Pink Cadillac for a drink as well as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert.   The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building. We were to see the 9pm showing so the doors were to open at 8:45pm. They came out and explained that the show had run over and we wouldn't be able to even enter the building until 9:20pm. It was 28 degrees outside. We finally were able to enter the building, order drinks then the show finally started at 9:45pm.  The host did offer a blanket apology which was nice but hardly made up for the fact the show started almost an hour late."
"I have been here twice in the last month. It's a pretty great time. My first visit, the service was pretty poor and the food was cold by the time it got to the table. We had to sit all the way in the back and the comedian was not that good (although that is no fault of the club). But when I went to the second show, the service was much improved. The burger I ordered was fantastic and warm. Our waitress kept the drinks coming without interrupting us while the comedian was on stage. We were also able to sit in the front this time and it was a great experience. I'll be going back soon!"
"Good! I can't comment on the food or the bathrooms, but from what experienced it was great! The drinks were decent, and I  believe you must order two items at minimum. The staff is quick, but they should have more people working on a Saturday night. Before you can ask for anything else they bolt to the next table or to the kitchen.  The comics we saw were funny as well. Will definitely go back!"
"I was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to go here to see funny man Bill Crawford, part of the DVE morning show for those of you who never heard of him.  That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven't... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there.  So I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum.  Well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order.  This was nice.  I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so.  There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10.  The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00.  Now that may seem rather expensive and it is, but doable so I indeed did it... My husband got a domestic and it was between 4-5 bucks.  We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later...  So the show was good.  There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable.  There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford.  I actually really enjoyed them.    The one or two things I didn't like about the place.  The bathrooms are in the lobby.  As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid.  I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance.  The same also goes for smoking.  Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering.  Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this.  A stamped hand?  A ticket stub?  Not sure but I know I would have felt better unlike feeling like I was sneaking into the place.    I would definitely return to the Improv.  I just hope I always have a rather positive experience!"
"I went here for the first time the other night and had a great time!  The comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends!  My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket, but every person needs to buy 2 items of food/drink and the drinks aren't cheap (around $10-12).  However, I would definitely go back sometime!"
"Wast there last Friday. Seats right in front if the stage. The show was good. The headliner, while a bit long, was good. Fantastic service from our waitresses. Will definitely go back."
"Absolutely loved it at the Improv! I saw Sheryl Underwood and she was fantastic. It was my first time being at the Improv. After years of saying that I wanted to go, it really did meet my expectations! The ambiance is inviting, with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place. We were 8th in line so we had good choice of seating, though we were encouraged to fill the seats in the front by the stage first. The seating is layered in tiers. Each tier has a long booth with tables and chairs for seating. It was very comfortable, roomy and an interactive set up. The stage is close to the seating (some tables are right at the stage) with little space between you and the comedian, which made it very interactive and fun. We arrived at the Improv around 9:45 pm for a show that started at 10:30 pm, with doors opening at 10:00 pm. We waited in line until the doors opened at about 10:15-10:20 pm, so they were really behind schedule. The show started around 10:45 pm with two opening comedians before the main act. The show was over around 1:00 am. The only negatives were that the staff was not very friendly and immediately told me that I have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu. ($30/ticket isn't enough?) I was not hungry and did not want to drink, so this was a bit frustrating, especially because it wasn't disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else. The server did not hold us to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and I got away getting 3 drinks for the night. The food menu looked great and the prices seemed reasonable, though if you want water you are looking at $5 for Fiji or sparkling. It was $8 for a glass of wine. $11 for bottomless soda, complete with a take home Improv glass. The other thing that I didn't like was that an employee takes your tickets while you're waiting in line and marks your hands with a dry erase marker. After one bathroom trip, the mark was gone, so I think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already paid customer since the employee takes your proof of purchase. These negatives did not affect my overall experience negatively and I would most certainly go back! It is a fun place where you are guaranteed to have a good time with a lot of laughter!"
"Nice little venue for quality fun.  I saw Greg Warren here last night and had a really good time.    Check out yippit.com or sign up for Goldstar.com before buying tickets at full price. You can usually find substantial discounts for shows on one of those two sites. Sure there's a two drink minimum but I'm thinking that it helps pay for the comics and helps keep the price of admission down.  When you think about it, it's really a win-win."
"The Waterfront at Homestead is insane, and saves me the trip of driving all the way to Ross Park Mall. Anyway, the Giant Eagle here is enormous, as you'd imagine. It's still a standard Giant Eagle, aka the best grocery store ever."
"I like this Giant Eagle. They have the organic section and they're currently(Feb 2011) in the process of remodeling too, which is both annoying (now) and exciting (for the future).  PROS: Always seems to be decent parking available; They have those cute little double-tier carts; Organics section; Wine Vending Machine (that's freaking awesome--Yay, Pennsylvania!); Lots of Self-Check-Out lanes;  CONS: Sometimes the staff is a bit cranky (but that can occur anywhere, i guess);"
"As far as GE's go, this location is great. It has basically everything you need and is well organized. You can find a lot of ethnic ingredients you can't get at other GE stores. They also offer a wine kiosk, hot bar, salad bar, and bulk olives. I would venture to say this is better than the market district."
"Waterfront Geagle is my primary market. Now that they've expanded and reorganized, I rarely even have to set foot in Target anymore. Yippie! There's a wine kiosk (suck it PA liquor laws), you can buy crazy expensive 6 packs, cheese market, bakery, salad and hot bar, butcher, florist, dry cleaners, international foods, pharmacy, and a little cosmetics/beauty/bath area. They usually have a sufficient number of lanes open, and it doesn't get nearly as crowded as Market District. I do wish a bulk spice selection was included as part of the expansion, but you can't always get what you want, I suppose."
"You're getting an extra star for two solid reasons.    One is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again (and a bit fancier).  Two, and thee most important part, this iggle has the best quality and well made sushi out of any Iggle's out there!  Believe me, I've eaten many a rainbow roll from many different locations around the Burgh and nothing has compared.  Dare I say, it's as close as you get to going to a good sushi restaurant.  Bold statement, right?   I  just love me some sushi and want it often, quick and convenient and this serves all those purposes with upholding the quality.  Need a quick sushi fix?  This place is it!"
"oddly enough, of all the giant eagles i have visited in pittsburgh, this is the only location that carries the toothpaste that i've used for most of my life (outside of pittsburgh). the location is clean and the staff are friendly.  i sometimes resent having a market district being the closest giant eagle to my apartment, as many of the items that i buy there are severely overpriced. but whenever i run out of groceries and toothpaste at the same time, i take the hike down to waterfront to shop here, although they may not carry all the groceries that i'd like."
"This is a absolutely beautiful Giant Eagle.  I only stopped in to grab a quick bite from the prepared foods section, but I was rather impressed by how clean it was.  It was 9 oclock at night, and they still had a huge section of prepared foods available.  The Starbucks inside was closed, probably due to the fact it was a Sunday night, but that is another plus!"
"I'm with Rachel C. on this one. You get an extra star for being a pretty Giant Eagle and a Cafe with a very decent beer selection of 6packs and individual bottles. Even though the Giant Eagle in Robinson is better in my opinion you, Waterfront Giant Eagle, are not bad and pretty close to where I live."
"I found everything I needed and I liked the expansion, the antipasta bar is on point and they sale Vanilla Coke which made my hubby very happy.   Great store."
"Just about every you need.  With great hours, a solid hot bar, sushi (if you're into that),  a dry cleaning service, pharmacy, tons of produce, bakery and butchers counter you can't go wrong. Two things that drive me crazy always needing to use my perks card for self check out and the lack of hand carts in the front. I always have to walk to a lane and hunt for a basket then double back, super annoying.   That said its a small, and easily repairable (hint) issue that shouldn't keep you from visiting."
"One of the best grocery stores in the area. Good produce, wide variety of cheeses, good cuts of meat and there's even a six pack shop on the premise."
"Years ago I would have given the Big Bird 2 stars. What changed my mind? Competitive pricing.  Thanks, GE for making it worthwhile to shop your sales. While your no Aldi, you definitely are winning on this front.   This is my goto GE. Always clean, organized and great selection. Added beer a couple years ago and the deli, prepared foods are up to par as well.  Always busy and parking never an issue."
"I luv store, plenty of cashiers. My father eats there couple times a week. He is a senior citizen and he usually get free coffee because he is a veteran. Last week he was told they no longer doing that program. Today he went to the Edgewood Giant Eagle and they gave him free coffee."
"This giant eagle is one of the only things I miss about  old house. The produce section and deli were great. Also had an overall nice selection of everything."
"One comfy seat in the entire place, but they have a cafe, they have good books to look at, and they are open until 11pm.  What more could you want?  Why an APPLE PURSE of course!  And a nice Earl Gray tea thrown in for good measure.  Wow...I love this place.  I am such a nerd...only a nerd would enjoy going to a book store and reading as much as I do.  The extra amenities just make it that much more enjoyable."
"Like any Barnes & Noble, it has a nice comfy cafe, and a large selection of books.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They stock a decent selection, and the prices are pretty reasonable.  Obviously it's hard for them to compete with Amazon.  However since all the small shop bookstores are gone, it's nice to walk into one every once in a while."
"I love books. I love to look at them, hold them, read the cover, thumb through the pages, and then finally I love to dig into a juicy story. When I'm in the area I love coming in here for a latte and book browsing/reading. Most of the time I cave and buy a book.  This store is clean and their employees are helpful and kind. They have two entrances/exits available, a fairly large section for movies & music, study guides, and other organized sections like self-help and history. I personally love the variety of cook books there. One of the attractive points of this store is a cafe. I can come in, sit down, read a magazine or book and just chill. The downside is the chairs aren't super comfortable (to me) and the cafe is usually packed with people. I wish they had more seating options around the store.  It's a convenient location to come in and kill some time like others have mentioned. There's a lot to find in there so come back and browse!"
"Fantastic food.  This place is mainly a \"bar\" and does get crowded but I really like the pizza here.  In fact I've never had a bad meal.  The staff are ussually very helpful but it does get a bit loud inside when crowded."
"Don't even think about not getting the pretzel dippers its pretzel sticks with honey mustard, cinnamon butter, and a spicy queso dip. The queso is my favorite but they were all delish. I also got the bruschetta which was very garlicky but delicious. 5-7 M-F is 1/2 off appetizers so I was able to get both the pretzel sticks and bruschetta for 7 bucks as a meal. The menu had a pretty wide range- my friend very much enjoyed a pear and chicken salad. We didn't get drinks but some looked good..."
"Went here for drinks and nachos and it is a very nice establishment.  The nachos were very good the drinks pricy but t be expected in a setting like this place.  There are fire places outside on the patio a huge bar and even though it doesnt seat many there is a very nice cozy setting upstairs.  Go here to relax or enjoy good food both thumbs up."
"I've eaten just once, mostly I go for drinks. Nice, lively place, nice outdoor seating for the summer and fall. Drinks are good, service is good. Location is great as well, right across the movie theater."
"love the ambiance and food!!"
"haha only came here once for happy hour, but i am just pleased with the price. i guess coming from ny, anything would be better price wise. $3 for draft and a big selection of beers so good times. also it's right across the theater so it's a good place to go and chill before the movie starts.. which is exactly what i did haha."
"I must say, my experience last night at Bar Louie was wonderful. I was hesitant to go because of the other reviews here, but my husband convinced me to give it a try.  The place is seat yourself and it's LOUD in there. I was a little underwhelmed by that at first but I got used to it and found myself enjoying the energy. Our service was fantastic. Courtney was great - super attentive, brought our drinks out in less than 5 minutes, brought our food quickly, checked on us just enough... And the place was packed. The drinks were perfect, just strong enough. We tried the Peach Lighting and the Tiki drink. I liked the tiki thing better but that's just personal choice. There were real berries mixed into that one. Yum. On to the food... My turkey/ham/Brie sandwich was delicious and my husband loved his burger. The highlight of the meal though was the Whiskey cake. Sonnet-worthy. We'll definitely go back again."
"Man, haters gonna hate.  Listen, y'all, Bar Louie isn't fancy.  It's just not and their extensive martini list won't fool me.  However, the food is good ole American bar grub and their beer selection is decent.  The staff has been nothing but nice even when my wannabe rowdy group of friends spent many a summer day sitting a table for four hours drinking dollar beers.  As long as Bar Louie still keeps having $1 Burger Days (Tuesdays) and $1 Beer Days (Wednesdays), I will continue to be a fan.  FYI, It's a fanatically cheap movie & dinner/drinks weekday date spot."
"I rather like Bar Louie for my outdoor dining experience after biking the rail trail or before a movie.  Been there twice now for both of before-mentioned occasions and both times had their appetizers.  Note that if you can catch them during their happy hour from 5 to 7pm on weeknights, your pocket book will thank you.  The two of us diners selected three appetizers to share the first visit and two on the second visit and were quite satisfied with presentation, quantity, and quality.  I would highly recommend the Bruschetta Pomodoro and the calamari (breaded just right and not overdone)."
"It's what I expected. Cooler then a Fridays and the food was about the same. It was clean and out waiter was really cool. It was so slow he even took a seat with us and chatted but in a good way and we welcomed him to do so. I had the bar Louie burger for my meal and it was good. Nothing outstanding but again what I expected. My group ordered the avocado fries and meatball appetizers. The avocado fries were good but we had to add salt. The meat balls with the small slices of garlic bread was fun to share and yummy.  We went on a slow Sunday night. It was clean and the food came out on time. Again I rate a places on what I expect it to be and what it try's to be not what I think it should be. So just a different kind of Fridays. Also great music playlist."
"My boyfriend and I dined at Bar Louie at the Waterfront about a month ago; it was my first time eating there and I was pretty impressed!  We got loaded nachos as an appetizer and all the toppings were as fresh as they come, not to mention delicious!  I ordered pasta (I cannot remember the name) but I asked for no artichokes in it. It turned out the artichokes were pre-mixed in the recipe, but the waitress came and informed us that the chef was whipping up a special batch just for me! I was extremely grateful and impressed.  Everything was delicious, the decor was industrial chic (which I love) and the atmosphere was buzzing and fun. The menu was a tad exotic for my small-town pallet, but it was great. My only complaint was the fact that you had to seat yourself, because we wandered around the crowded restaurant for about 10 minutes before we found a seat. The food and service certainly made up for it though!"
"Dollar beers on Wednesday Night and Loaded Tater Tots, pretty much two solid reasons to visit.  Matter of fact, they have some sort of special every night of the week wether it be food or drinks or both!  Located across from the movie theater this is a good place to go before or after a flick with your hot date.  I say skip over priced Burgatory and come here on Tuesday for dollar burgers.  Just as good and half the bill."
"Was there for Saturday dinner at 6pm and still had some seats opened.  We sat down right away.  You sat yourself and menu was at the table.   Very casual place, yet family place.   A little noisy so not for date nights.  A little bit sports bar like but not like Champs.  Food was great.  Had boneless chicken nuggets (el fuego).  Side salad was very good.  I had verde chicken pasta and my husband had cod skewers with shrimp fried rice - I had some and it was delicious.  Clean bathroom- very important."
"Great place for late dinner after work. Kitchen stays open late. Real good food. Full bar and real good service. Great location."
"I love Bar Louie's happy hour. $5 martini and half priced delicious veggie flatbread? Sign me up!  They also have a few other apps that  are part of the happy hour, but the flatbread is the one I usually get.   The melon martini is my current favorite, but most that I've tried have been good.  I don't recommend the shrimp appetizer. And I'm not sure about some of the other food, but happy hour is 5/5 stars. The rest of the time, Bar Louie is probably a 3 star place.   So, if you're in the waterfront and are thinking of Bar Louie, go for the happy hour!"
"I'm not into waterparks as much as I am into amusement parks.  I go to Sandcastle maybe once a year.  But my Chicago friend Catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo, we donned our swimsuits and came here.  The main part of the park is closed in the evenings, but the Sandbar and the Sandbar Pool and the Hot Tub remain open for the 21 and over set.  The Sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $6.00 cover charge to get in.  Occasionally there's live entertainment.  It's hard to believe that before they built this place, it was the site of an abandoned steel mill.  Actually, it was the railroad yard for the nearby Homestead Works.  But after site-clearing and clean-up, they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening.  The view across the Mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side.  There's even a boat dock, so you can arrive by river if you desire.  I'm glad I renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully, I'll get another chance to come back."
"How many times do you get to fall at 70mph, wearing only shorts? Sandcastle can make it happen.  If you're going, it's best to stop by Giant Eagle and grab you some discount tickets from the customer service desk.  $25 is still a bit much in my opinion, but it's better than spending the full $30.99.  There isn't much I can think of that's in Sandcastle that isn't a great time, except maybe walking around and scorching your feet on the boardwalk.  I personally am a huge fan of some of the faster tube slides, and of course the massive speed slide.  If you're looking for a more relaxed ride, check out the Lazy River, or screw around in the big pool.  There's also a pretty nice wave pool there for your amusement.  There's also plenty of stuff for kids to do... But I don't have kids, so I don't know how all that is.  They do close at 7PM, which is a bit early, so be warned: you definitely want to show up earlier in the day.  BUT it's definitely a good idea to close the park if you can: right toward the end, the lines disappear, and you can ride over and over.  Win!"
"So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.  So to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.  I seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it.   There was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)  The food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly.   Overall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground. Now go off and have some fun! :)"
"Now here's a place that knows what it is. A place to ride a few slides, relax on the lazy river, and watch the hilarious pittsburghers walk around with Jesus tattoos and many children.   Come for the slides, stay for the people watching."
"Haven't been to TGIFridays for years and was never really a huge fan. I get tired of going to the same places all the time for lunch so we decided to try it out. I must say that I was very impressed with how extensive the menu was and all of the delicious options. I had the two for $10 lunch special with French onion soup and terriakyi glazed chicken strips. I was told that the broccoli soup is very thick so I opted for the French onion. It was okay but I think that I would get a salad instead of the soup next time. The chicken strips were wonderful and I am still craving them. The portion was huge and there were leftovers. My co-workers ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler and burgers and were jealous at the portion and choices from the pick two. The service was good and we had no issues. I will definitely be back."
"Dining outdoors after a bike ride on the rail trail.  Just the right venue for that.  Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp.  The ribs were divine.  The shrimp not quite there -- I'd say they were overdone.    Our server, Ed, was very attentive.  I asked for celery in my bloody mary.  Not only did it come with a celery stalk in it, he brought over more celery.  Yummmm...."
"Good food.    I guess one reason I like this place is they don't hide how bad the food is for you. There is a little Kiosk with all the calories right by the door.  All in all I get the flat bread pizzas and really enjoy them  The steaks are also good and the price is reasonable.  Service is always friendly and the establishment is kept really clean and neat"
"I didn't know what to expect when I walked in, but I am now a fan. There is a cool way to review the menu on a touch kiosk to find out the calorie count.   The place looked nice. It was clean and really cool looking. The food was really good and our waiter was nice and friendly. I will be going back to try their pizza and other food.   We had a burger, which was really good, and we had the lobster slider. French fries were good to."
"My girlfriends made reservations here for my bachelorette party last Saturday. I highly suggest that you make reservations because we were able to just walk right in and sit down. There were people there waiting 30 minutes+. We had the sangria which was amazing. Our sever Alex recommend it and it was perfect for the 4 of us.  I had their thin crust pepperoni pizza which really hit the spot. My two friend had salads which they said were amazing and my other friend joined me in ordering a pesto chicken pizza. Let's just say there wasn't any food left on the table when we were finished.  I will be back for sure."
"Unos has been around for ever, & I feel like this restaurant chain peak in popularity in the 80's. Honestly the decor inside still kind of looks 80s to me even though its nice with sleek booth and exposed brick.  If you haven't died and he recently I ordered you to come back and have a meal here again because honestly the food is really quite good!  They have the best chicken salad wrap ever! I love that rap so much I want agreed to walk the south side River Trail from where the Steelers practice all the way to the damn waterfront just because I knew that I could convince my boyfriend to go to Unos with me for lunch.  Full disclosure:  I made him call is a cab and we took a taxi back to the parking lot after lunch.  Listen... The food and pizza and service are very good, surprisingly so! I don't know why this place is not busier but next time you're down at the Waterfront please do consider dining here!"
"All in favor of a deep dish pizza say I!.......IIIIIII,  ok now that i have that out of my system. This place is such a great hangout/eat-in spot. I hadn't been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening. I was so glad they were paying cause  I was low on funds at the time.  We arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad considering the crowd. We looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. Pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches.   After ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.  I'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount.   We came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what?? I will probably always eat this pizza whenever I come.   Only down side is slow service. It took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked. He got the numero uno which was ok but mine had way more flavor!!"
"Wham! 4 stars outta the park! The deep-dish pizza we had was amazing. I wasn't crazy about the avocado egg rolls, but the chocolate chip sundae was superb. Great service too from Maranda, a doll. Decor is cute. Ambience is lively. Recommended."
"I had the deep dish pizza and it was very good!  The individual size was smaller Than I expected for $12 but I wasn't starving so it was very filling.  Our waitress April was very nice and attentive for how busy it was.  We had about a 30 minute wait but it was worth it!  I can't wait to try it again!"
"My kids who are 3 and 5 ordered the make your own pizza. I initially had some reservations but it was actually fun for them and tasted pretty good too. I'd suggest it for anyone looking to do something sorts cool with their kids for dinner."
"Nice place to grab a bite and a beer. Service is quick, friendly and accurate. They've got a respectable selection of craft beers and the atmosphere is very clean and comfortable. Good view of the TV from any angle in the bar area (watching a Bucco's game at the moment) and the bar itself is full service. The Baked Stuffed Spinoccoli chicken that I had was delicious. I have no idea why I don't come here more often... I should!"
"Service is always great at Bath & Body. You know you're going into a scent filled area.  I can spend a mint in here.   Service at this location in particular has always been great. Even on the busiest of Black Fridays. I'm guessing good management and good training.   B&B always asks for an email address, by I no longer get email coupons. ?? Like for years. I get them in the USPS, but why ask for email address then?  Update*** I asked about the email coupons to the sales associate. She instructed me to call the number on the receipt to let them know I'm not receiving. She also gave me a 20% off coupon because mine I found online was only for online purchases. Much appreciated!"
"Stopped in after leaving a friends house and avoiding going home to do laundry. I love BBW & especially the holiday collection. The employee was very friendly. She gave me her opinions on her favorites and told me about the Buy 3, Get 3 Free holiday sale they had going on. She sang and hummed the holiday music being played while i enjoyed browsing and checking out the items. Love BBW!"
"I usually have good luck at this store, and, aside from Goodwill, it's where I get my work slacks and jeans. I find there's a good classic to trendy clothing ratio here, so I can get a great white button up shirt or basic tees, and peruse the more trendy-ish items. There's always a great sale, and the salespeople are friendly. It's a good bargain to get the Ann Taylor credit card (and pay it off every month) because you'll get lots of great coupons for in-store and online shopping."
"Within the last six months, Loft has become my go-to store for tops. My daily commute takes me by the Waterfront every day, so it's easy to pop into this location and check out their newest inventory. Loft does a great job of turning inventory quickly. Every couple weeks, the store has new product with a full clearance section. I'm also signed up for the brand's emails so I know when promotions are going on. They offer 30-40% off the store every month or so (generally around major holidays) and also offer 40-50% off clearance pretty frequently.  I enjoy the layout and store appearance much better than Ross Park and Robinson. Ross Park's store is very bland, and Robinson is currently in a temporary store. Shopping in an environment with bright fluorescent lights and boring white walls is just terrible, so I enjoy the Waterfront's pretty street-side location best.  The employees at this location are just OK. Sometimes I am cheerfully greeted at the front door but am generally ignored the entire time that I am shopping. I recently had a very attentive sales associate who opened a fitting room for me when my arms were becoming full, but I thought that I noticed someone with a District Manager vibe lurking around, which probably encouraged the associate's motivation.   I actually had a very negative experience at this store during a recent sales event. The event ended at 7pm on a weekday, and I rushed to the store after getting off work. I hurried around the store and jumped into line at 7:02pm. All associates abandoned the registers at 7pm, totally ignoring me and the other two girls waiting in line. When I was finally helped several minutes later, the snippy associate told me that the discount may or may not go through... that corporate determined when the discount was turned off. OK, that's great, but then why did you totally ignore me and your other customers for several minutes? Did you want us to not get the discount? I was appalled by the rudeness of both the associate and a manager I spoke with earlier in the evening, who was equally rude about the sharp end time of the discount. What made the situation much worse is that a good friend of mine was a manager at Loft a couple years ago and told me that ringing up after 7pm would not be a problem. Hah, well it was a problem at the Waterfront location!  The only reason that I gave Loft 4 stars is because I love the brand, discounts, and quality of product as a whole. The staff at this location is sub-par and do not reflect the brand well. I hope that Loft does not lose customers based on negative customer service experiences.... They're lucky that I like the product enough to ignore some occasional rudeness."
"When I lived in Los Angeles a year and a half ago, P F Chang's was no great shakes, one of millions of places with good but not outstanding stuff on the menu.  Here in Pittsburgh, it's the only Chinese place I've found that combines genuinely good service with quality food.  Not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in LA's top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here.  The Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles.  Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too.  Their fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don't quite like.  Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do.  Portions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came.  The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees.  If you live in LA, forget P F Chang's.  If you live in NYC, I'm sure there are a dozen better places on a single block.  But here in Pittsburgh, it's just about the best place around."
"I like PF Changs.  I think I've only been here a total of three times (twice it was take out), and I only get vegetarian dishes, but what I've had has been pretty tasty.  I would definitely eat here again."
"I am writing this from the standpoint of someone who can't eat real Chinese food because of gluten issues. That said, I am loving me some gluten-free Chinese food here! If the gf issue didn't exist, though, why bother when you can get real, honest, non-chain GREAT Chinese so many wonderful places in the Burgh?!  But average Chinese is better than NO Chinese if gluten is an issue so thank you Mr. Chang!"
"Pretty Good Stuff!  PROS: Nice bar area Cool ambiance nice dishes with good flavors  CONS: Pricey for \"just chinese food\" typically a rather long wait, especially on weekends. Very difficult to even get noticed by the bartenders once its busy at the bar area.  Suggestions: Lettuce Wraps (just get this as you meal!  LOL) Fat Cat Martini (OMG, YUMMMMM!) Pot Stickers"
"Our go to place at the waterfront.   We usually order the crispy green beans as an app., they are always fried just right and never really greasy. As an entree I always get coconut curry tofu, the veggies are bright and crisp (no open pea pods or limp broccoli!) And the tofu is simply delightful.   Always consistent. Never disappointing"
"My vegan friend, Deb, turned me onto the fact that one can dine at PF Chang's and stay on a vegan diet.  Vegan friend Deb (VFD) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. The waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version, but it was never put on the menu. Warning: even though it's vegan, it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt, fat, and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. The vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken.  They also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic, eggplant and garlic, and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables.  I always loved the fact PF Chang's offered brown rice. That nutty flavor goes so well with their meals.  The service staff at Chang's is always top shelf, I've never had a bad time here and love when we go."
"We visitied PF Changs on Sunday with a large group of 20 people.  Although they had to split the tables - everything was delicious!  We enjoyed everything from the spring rolls and chicken lettuce wraps...to the mooshu that they made special vegetarian for one of the guests...to the fried banana dessert!  if you are with a group, and you want dessert - get the fried bananas!  They come wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and with coconut/pineapple ice cream.  Overall, we had a great time and would come back here again."
"So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try.   We came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food."
"My daughter & I enjoy  PF Chang's each time we dine there together. I am in Love with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps delicious! It is always a wonderful experience!"
"I've always liked PF Chang's and, generally speaking, this location is pretty good. I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely personable and fast.  The food is typical PF Chang's: delicious. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of \"Chinese\" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entrées and have never been disappointed.  I've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones.  The only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more. If you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. I've yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait. PF Chang's, included."
"used to wait hours for food here a few years ago  second visit in 6 months -  kung pao shrimp was very salty  very good service  great wall cake still very good - kids will not leave without having it"
"singapore street noodles.  The end"
"The service started out slow, but they eventually picked up the pace. We ordered the chicken/lettuce wrap appetizer, and we enjoyed it. For the entres, we had the fried rice and mongolian beef, both of which were delightful. I would not mind going back to explore their menu."
"Good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef.  Bar service was fast and Efficent.   Good value.  Not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat.   Fortune was even Postive!"
"I usually have fair experiences with this PF Changs. I've been inside the restaurant, and have used the curbside to go service. I finally decided to review this based on my most recent experience.  I can't remember her name, but whomever worked curbside to go on Oct 30, 2013 around 6:30PM deserves a mention. She was very nice, and provided us with the exact amount of condiments we listed on the online order form. They're usually stingy with the chili and hot mustard sauces! She also gave us a couple other sauces to try (not sure which ones), but these were very good.   The food here is always in point. I like to get the edamame, sesame chicken with brown rice, and the flour less chocolate dome!   I'm reducing a star because of past experiences with service."
"Really awesome food and amazing customer service. I really enjoyed my experience here if I am back in the area I will be certain to come back to this location."
"First, this is a big chain - not my favorite type of eatery.  For me, four stars is max for this type of establishment for the simple reason that no one has license to create anything truly unique...  However!  The Chilean Sea Bass Marinated in Oolong Tea is freakin' fantastic!  10+  Now - everyone was happy with their meals and let me tell you it was a ridiculously busy night, servers were threading their way through patrons waiting to be seated and our service was very good.  I've been to PFC Vegas and PFC NYC - our Homestead PFC definitely beats them both.  So many great little places to try in the 'Burgh, but I wouldn't resist going back to this particular PFC."
"We had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was much improved. There was no crowd to fight and we weren't seated near the door as we were last time. As I expected, getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience. Our service was good and they accommodated our 1 year old nicely. I appreciate that they serve steamed veggies on the kids menu.   I still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places, but we were satisfied and happy."
"Went here for lunch yesterday with a friend and it was so yummy! Started out with chicken lettuce wraps and it was totally hitting the hungry spot! Lol. Tried chicken lettuce wrap at my places but this place is one of my fave. Their wonton shop is also full of chicken chunks and shrimps as well... which is different bc you don't normally get all that in a wonton soup bowl.  By the time we ate the lettuce wraps and our soups, we were almost full. LOVE the way their Mongolian beef is made here and my friend had the crispy honey shrimp and it was so yummy as well. Definitely will be back because this place is clean, service is quick, food is delicious, and the price isn't so bad either."
"This is the fourth Changs I've eat ate. It was pretty good. The food was kinda like it had been previously frozen. Had a strange texture. Some of the changs chicken pieces was stuck together and the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was mushy and falling off the chicken. Overall still pretty good. Would eat at this one again."
"Excellent beef with pepper and onions. Waiter made a good wine choice. Fastest food delivery, less than 5 minutes, honest. Both meals less than $30, in and out in 45 minutes."
"Meal was about what I expected. Service was good, not exceptional but good. They are trying a new menu with tacos for breast cancer awareness.  A nice thought but they should stay in their wheelhouse which is Asian. Obviously stick with what you know..."
"If I had to pick my very favorite chain restaurant, it would be PF Chang's.  I'm aware that it's not authentic, but that doesn't mean it's not delicious.  We stopped by after some shopping in the area on a snowy Friday, and were able to get a table pretty quickly.  The hostess and server were both friendly.  My husband enjoyed a glass of sake, and I had a mai tai that turned out to be delicious.  We split an order of lettuce wraps as an appetizer; they don't custom-make your sauce any more which is disappointing, but they did happily provide us with chili paste and hot mustard to doctor it up ourselves.  His Chang's Spicy Chicken (extra spicy) turned out great, and provided the extra requested heat.  My Orange Peel Shrimp were as good as I'd remembered-- perhaps better because they have some fresh orange slices included as well.  We also ordered a Great Wall of  Chocolate.  If you like  chocolate cake at all, you'll love this one.  PF Chang's consistently provides good Chinese in a trendy (but still casual) atmosphere at a decent price, and I'm always a fan."
"I live close by so I go here frequently pretty much for the free WIFI and espresso. But here's a secret - they don't seem to know what an Americano is so often I am charged like 75 cents for a double shot of espresso to which they add hot water upon my request. Needless to say coffee is not expensive here as you can fill up as many times as needed without being hassled. Although there regular coffee is undrinkable to my taste. Pastries are baked fresh and are plentiful. There is other foods to choose from ie whole grain bagels are edible and about a buck with no extra charge for butta. Outside seating and people watching is always a good distraction plus there are all kinds of people who frequent this Panera from the very very old and decrepit to the fashionistas taking a break from Victoria Secrets, Ulta, Wet Seal and the other various shops at this water front location."
"I Love all Panera, equally! I am def a fan of this easy, better than fast food, time-killing eatery.  Great place for a lunch social/date with good eats and a good place to sit and talk for a while or to get some work done between appointments.  PROS: Great Food; Free WiFi (though some locations are limited to 30 minutes during the lunch hour); Seating is always tricky at the lunch hour.  CONS: pricey for salads, soup and sandwiches; tables should be wiped more frequently--even if you have to ask a newly seated guest if they would like it wiped, the tables should be wiped!  For Pete's sake, give a fork with the Mac and Cheese, not a SPOON!  lol"
"I really enjoy Panera, and this restaurant meets my expectations. I particularly love the Asiago Cheese Bagel, Caesar Salad, Bacon Turkey Bravo Sandwich, Tuna Salad Sandwich, Smokehouse Turkey Panini, Broccoli Cheddar Soup, and Iced Chai Tea Latte. I've ordered all of these items at this location, and they have been very tasty.  I have had this location run out of the side of French Baguette once or twice. However, last time that occurred, I asked for a bread bowl as a replacement, which I was given for free.  I'll definitely be returning soon!"
"It's the same Panera food you've had before.  I like the other ones better as they are often  faster at preparing food than this one.  That said the food is fine and the staff is nice enough.  They have warm cookies for $2.00.  That is a nice feature."
"This use to be my go to Panera Bread.  When I worked in the area I would stop here before work to grab my breakfast and then stop to get my lunch as well.  I was happy when I left the area and moved on to bigger and better things.  My waist also appreciated it.  Those scones are delicious.  I recently stopped back here when I was shopping and was pleasantly surprised.  With all my new allergies I came in here hoping to get some bread.  Not knowing, nor doing my homework before I showed up, I asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not.  Not knowing the answer herself, she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes, ingredients included.  After looking through it for a few minutes I was able to select the bread I wanted.  They will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now.  If you would rather slice yourself, I am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way.  Yes, it's true, it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf.  But it is much better tasting."
"It was my first time here.  Was recommended by my coworker.  However, I was a little unsure as I've read some bad reviews about this place.  The first visit was great.  The receptionists were helpful and gave me guidance on how to get my dog licensed.  Everyone seemed happy and talkative.    Dr. Bezak was very nice.  He had a smile on him the entire time I was there.  He was very quick to give me information about anything and everything relating to the dog.  Overall, I had a good first visit and definitely going back.  The only thing that made it didn't earn a five-star is that my appointment is at 12:15pm.  The entire office have their lunch at 1pm.  So I can tell there was alot of hustle to get me out of their asap.  I don't mind that it was a quick visit, but I would have liked to had time to ask more questions.  If you want adequate time with the doc, consider making your appointment after their lunch."
"As not only pet-owners, but as dog breeders let me say - we love this place!  We've heard some bad things from several acquaintances and counldn't believe our ears...Dr. Bezak is great and the staff is really friendly and helpful."
"What can I say, I'm a shill for Target!  Like another reviewer says, you have to watch the impulse buying here because it is so easy to do!  But as for the name brands here, I've never had a problem with them.  I bought some Woolrich blankets and sheets here that my husband and I have been very satisfied with.  The housewares section here is positively unbeatable.  My husband Rick is an amateur chef and he could blow his paycheck on the kitchen utensils.  He particularly likes the Michael Graves ones.  He is also an amateur photographer and he still works with film, so he likes the film development here.  Me, I also like buying household cleaners and personal items such as soaps, toothpaste, deoderant, etc because the selection is so good.  I've also purchased a lot of my casual wear here."
"Oh Target!  You are big corporate America!  But how can I not love you so?  Your prices are the best whenever I need household goods like detergents, cleaners, etc.  For personal effects such as toiletries, soap, etc, you can't be beat!  Your cookware and bakeware department is every bit as good as Macy's!  And I see you have the retro tees too.  You know:  Yes http://www.dovenetq.net.au/~mahayes/Graphics/YesLogoFullCircle1.jpg Boston http://www.vinylrecords.ch/B/BO/Boston/Boston/boston-63.jpg Led Zeppelin http://henrikfalck.com/blog/uploaded_images/LedZeppelinLedZeppelinalbumcover-716782.jpg  We know what \"retro tee\" means:  faux aged, catering to boomers and teens, and costing way more than they origianlly did.  Oh and made in China of course!"
"After working for the rival of Target for years, Target has become my favorite mega chain store to shop at.  Although it does not seem to have every single item as other stores I'm still able to get in and get out in a hurry.    Depending on the time of day, it may be a task just to find a parking space due to the traffic light at the end of the road.  If you don't mind walking a bit, the aisle where the pharmacy sign is on the building usually has spots closer to the front of the store.  The only downside I can find for this location is the smell of overly burnt buttered popcorn as soon as you walk in due to the cafe location.  I prefer not to vomit as soon as I walk into a store, maybe after about ten minutes in I'd consider it."
"This is a really great pharmacy - friendly, quick, knowledgeable, and inexpensive."
"Target is pretty standard. If you've been to one of them, you'll know largely what to expect from this one. That being said, this store is clean, and the deals one clearance can be good. Just make sure to check the circular and the website, as sometimes additional coupons can be found that the store personnel aren't aware of.   The electronics department staff are not very knowledgeable, and tried to pressure me into buying a different TV by repeating marketing lingo, but were unable to explain what their claims actually were when challenged on them, so make sure to do your research beforehand if purchasing electronics."
"Target is one of my favorite stores -- I just love wandering around late at night when the store is quiet -- it's just so therapeutic! This location is now my closest store, so I drop by pretty often.  This store is pretty average. Inventory and customer service aren't particularly stellar but isn't poor either. I've generally been able to find what I need here and check out pretty quickly.   In addition to the common pharmacy and photo studio found in most Targets, this location also has an optical department. Of the 10-15 locations in the Pittsburgh area, only this store and the Cranberry store sell glasses. I purchased a pair of glasses and sunglasses through Target Optical three years ago and have been very happy with their product and customer service."
"I was in and out, and I didn't wait in long to long so I'm happy."
