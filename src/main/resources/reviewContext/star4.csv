after a second visit to bravo, ive become a fan. we had a satisfying first meal at lunch time, but werent overly impressed. our second meal left a more lasting, favorable impression. for the most part, we did not feel any of the growing pains that normally would be experienced from a newer restaurant. bravo is solid option for us and a nice addition to the galleria expansion.its was our fault the we had a pedestrian experience on our first visit mainly because my wife and i ordered pedestrian dishes. i had the fettuccine alla bolognese with a cup of wedding soup and my wife ordered the candied bacon burger. we split the bravo cheesecake for dessert. everything was satisfactory but i did get a little perturbed from lack of communication by the kitchen because with my seat facing the kitchen, i witnessed the cook sell my pasta well before the burger was finished, leaving my entree to sit dying in the window for at least 78 minutes.our second visit was enjoyed outside on the patio with perfect weather. i recommend dining alfresco as you have a nice view of the newly built canopy with some palo verdes dominating the nice landscaping. my entree was the spicy scallop marinara and my wife ordered a bravo chopped salad and the broiled tilapia with spicy tomato sauce. although these items from the light menu were easy on the calories, they were heavy on the flavor. comprised of many components, with sweetness from the scallops, tang from the artichokes, bitterness from the spinach, and heat from the sauce, the flavors were still well balanced and i was happy with my choice.service was excellent on both visits and everything ran smoothly without complication. parking is directly in front of the restaurant so your walk wont be too far. theres also a happy hour which could be a possible getaway spot to grab a snack and a drink if the wife is dilly dallying in the mall for too long.
lots to like here. service is always super solicitous, makes me double check the prices to see if im in a more expensive restaurant than i first thought. the lasagna looks amazing but it is packed with sausage and then some. just know what you are getting.
we split a chicken berry salad and split an eggplant and pasta dinner. the salad served was the wrong one and the pasta with the main dish arrived cold. our waitress brought us a hot bowl of pasta.the restaurant is lovely . i also noticed a  nice private room .
went here for fathers day. the restaurant is located byin the galleria mall in henderson. can a good restaurant be in such a location? absolutely!i had my doubts since the eatery is not in a freestanding building but attached to a mall.... i was blown away by the ambiance of the place and the food was top notch. the portions looked small until i started eating. i only got halfway through my dish when i hit a wall and couldnt go any further. i would definitely come back.
forgot about the happy hour free appetizer in yelp. the deal was two full course meals for 29.95 which runs sundays thru thursdays. everything was good chopped salad, bread, entree and dessert but waiter didnt attend to our empty waters. well go back! large portions not like some restaurants.
my wife and i came here for a nice lunch after walking around the galleria mall. we had the following:chicken, spinach  bacon flatbread 8.49grilled chicken  candied bacon sandwich 11.49scallop marinara 13.49the flatbread was great. the bread was quite thin and crispy while i could taste all the ingredients also. my wife said her scallop dish was good, nice and spicy. i tasted it and the only thing was that the artichoke slices in the dish didnt need to be there. they were a little chewy and made the overall texture of the dish awkward. and by the way, the scallops were baby scallops and not those ones you see in fancy restaurants. my sandwich tasted good and the accompanying, wellseasoned sweet potato fries were probably one of the best fries ive tasted here in vegas. note to yelpers: dont order the chicken flatbread appetizer and chicken sandwich as they have basically the same ingredients. overall, id say this was a nice experience.
dont get the pasta bravo! entree.now that weve gotten that out of the way, i think i can say that ive had enough good dishes to recommend this place. located next to dillards and larsens grill and facing sunset road, bravo! cucina italiana provides a sitdown option thats more upscale than other galleria mall dining options such as chevys and red robin.i had the complimentary rosemary focaccia on both occasions. its soft and herbaceous, and it soaks up all the liquid you might want. their house olive oil and vinegar is quite tasty, but i wasnt as impressed with the herbed red dipping sauce that they provided on my second visit.i had mamas lasagna bolognese 17.99 during that first visit. it isnt exactly a traditional italian lasagna. its presented in an oval ceramic bowl, and it has an alfredo sauce and a bolognese sauce, but it does have that gooey mozzarella on top, ricotta inside, and tasty ground beef spiced in an italian way. there was a bit of a vegetable inside that give a crunch, and i enjoyed this as well. oh, and the server handgrates parmesan cheese to top your lasagna to your liking. i had it 50 off on national lasagna day, and while im not sure how i feel about the full price value, i was quite happy with the deal.the second time around, i focused on their happy hour menu. they call it bar bites and provide it in the bar  high top seating section 3:306:30pm on weekdays, and all day on weekends. i shared some appetizers with my friend because theyre such a good deal.the first app was arancini 3.95 bar bites price, which they describe as fried cheesy risotto. maybe risotto is a bit off, and although they do invite comparisons to tater tots, theyre very crunchy outside and creamy inside. they went well with either of the two dipping sauces, one a mildly spicy cream diavolo, and the other a simple tomato sauce pomodoro.the crispy mozzarella ravioli 4.95 bb was perhaps more delicious. it has a similar blend of textures as the first app, but richer flavor from the mozzarella. it comes with a horseradish aioli and a marinara sauce. again, everything was good.the spicy bacon  boursin flatbread 4.95 bb sounded a lot better than it tasted. it should have been a home run with candied bacon, chared tomato sauce, caramelized onions, mozzarella, parmesan spicy aioli, and green onions. it wasnt bad, but none of the components stood out.finally, we split that underwhelming pasta bravo! 15.99. underseasoned if al dente rigatoni, underseasoned dry chicken, uninspiring mushrooms, and a decent roasted red pepper sauce needed all the help it could get flavorwise, and i did have it in the form of leftover sauces from the apps. i just didnt think to use it until the last few bites, and it shouldnt be necessary. im disappointed that a dish that bears the restaurant name and is described as their signature dish was so underwhelming, but at least a 10offanentree birthday credit via their mybravo rewards program took the sting out of the wallet.i didnt have any service issues, especially not on todays visit. they took orders and delivered food promptly all apps simultaneously, entree son enough afterward. also, they processed discounts just fine. i was glad to see that the bogo bar bites appetizer w yelp checkin worked in addition to the 10 credit.i avoided downgrading my rating to three stars because i would definitely come back to bravo! for cheap happy hour appetizers and the lasagna. legit sitdown restaurants are few and far between in this area of henderson near sunset station, but it looks like this sister restaurant of brio tuscan grille has managed to fill a neighborhood niche, give or take one particular pasta dish.update 122315: visit 3. had 10 credit again for some reason, so i went back to bar bites. my favorite tonight was the bravo! fries at 3.95, with wellseasoned fries, delicious crumbled bacon, gorgonzola, creamy horseradish aioli, and green onions cut on the bias. the bravo! burger at 5.95 is quite serviceable overall with american cheese, the same aioli as the above fries, and unadorned fries w a side of ketchup. i thought the bun was rather bready though, and the patty wasnt perfectly mediumrare throughout. the crispy shrimp napoli, 5.95, was the most disappointing due to toosoft shrimp and a relatively tamebland sauce.
decided to check out the new place in town and was very happy here!  the food is large and so good.  i had the bravo pasta which was creamy and very full of flavor.  the lasagna was very good as well.  my fav was their calamari which they serve with two types of sauce... the white one is much better then the red! beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff.  go give this new place a try!
i have dined here about 5 or 6 times now. its not olive garden basic, but its not gourmet italian either. if you are craving pasta, this will do the job. however i have to agree with fellow elite chris v., do not get the pasta bravo. its just unimpressive and nothing special. the alfredo sauce is good. the house salad with the creamy parmesan dressing, super yummy. honestly all of the salads are great. the steak is a solid choice but again simply mediocre versus wonderful. nothing is bad, but the only thing that makes me love coming back is the dam cheesecake. a huge slice with a creme bruleed crust, worth the average food, every single time. and the service is outstanding. even when they are slammed busy, or i order take out, they seem to be on point no matter what. i have also had a couple cocktails. this place would be great for salads, appetizers, and a bottle of wine. truly between 3 and 4 stars, but considering there is nothing wrong or bad, i will go with the 4. i am just a picky italian girl with high end taste. this place will get the job done.
i hesitated coming here because initial reviews were just average. we had shrimp napoli for our appetizer and thought it excellent with the right amount of heat. our entrees, pasta bravo and lobster ravioli were both good. we thought the portion size for the ravioli was small but it ended up being the perfect size. we had no room for dessert. we were in at around 3pm., so the restaurant was not busy. i probably would have been irritated at the noise level if the restaurant was full. good inbetween restaurant...not fast food and i think a bit better than olive garden for food and ambience.
i went in with low expectations and had a great time.  i didnt even know she was a singer.  i dont think i am her target demographic.  i was the youngest person there by about 20 years.  i know her mainly from threes company and thighmaster infomercials.  i had never heard most of the songs she sang but her stories were entertaining and she has a great voice.  she still looks amazing too.  there were several smitten older gentleman in the audience.  she gave them a little extra attention.  it was cute.  she shows a lot of clips of her career.  that was interesting.  i would have loved to bring my mom back to see the show but it looks like it has been cancelled.  bummer.
opening day, and after seeing the menu, i was eager to try it!went to the bar for happy hour, and it wasnt packed. a good crowd for an opening day monday. nice big space and exceptionally large patio also!the decor is somewhat unique, with the schooled theme  all. i had a ninkasi brew draft which was 4 on happy hour. the 2 apps i had 4 street tacos 7  deviled eggs 5 were very good. both were pretty spicy and i imagine they will be toned down, though i loved the spice. maybe they had more staff on hand in order to handle a large crowd or maybe its a heavily staffed kind of place. overall, worth trying for the great happy hour deals and a nice, brand spanking new patio with quite a view!
omg! what to say but fun and yummy! our after work recess happy hour was more than i could have hoped for! i love the school theme including bp and j sliders as well as recess games like giant jenga and beer pong! we also got to enroll in the honor rolltheir loyalty program! i totally recommend this place as our server valerie was great and everything we had was unique to eat!
usually when a place first opens it hits or misses.  this place hit!  didnt even know this place existed until our friends insisted we leave our happy hour to do their happy hour.  we were not disappointed in the food, value or service.  all were great.  great list of food and drink happy hour items.  great school vibe with cleaver decor including the style of the menus.   they had jenga and beer pong on their big outside patio. fun to play or even watch.  we will be back and recommend this spot to others!
the new hot spot in downtown summerlin!  awesome look. huge layout. sweet outside wrap around patio. good food. try the pbj sliders. very unique twist!  tasted great.
good place. good potential. still shaking off the opening jitters. wait staff could use some bussers to focus on the customers but the food and drinks are good. cant wait to come back when theyve had time to settle in!
food decent. prices decent. good beer. ok mixed drink options. the it place right now.  very friendly staff and servers.
perfect place for breakfast, brunch, lunch... will try at dinner later... excellent food and service.. our waiter christian was very much pending to our needs. we will be back... definitely...
we ordered wild mushroom pizza, ahi tuna tacos and the cutting board which is charcuterie. loved the pizza but it was too crispy for me. the tacos were amazing. the cutting board was nothing special. because it being new, service was just okay. theyre still learning. the outside terrace is amazing to hang and have a drink.
was looking for somewhere new to eat for my birthday and found this place online. came in and found myself to love the experience of being in school. bookshelves, books, world maps, an amazing solar system lighting piece, chalkboards, list goes on..the menu is on a notebook, loved it. and specialty drinks listed on college ruled paper on a small clipboard. definitely a schoollike atmosphere. we started with tater tots with sriracha ketchup bomb!!, and ahi tacos tasted a little too acidic for me, then went on to order the steak salad steak perfectly cooked, though the salad itself a little too oily for my taste. couldnt tell if i was drooling or if it was the salad oil dripping, but overall good. my colleague ordered the adobo taco with cilantro lime rice i shouldve ordered that, that was crazy delicious, then sampled a few brews before deciding what we wanted. our waitress was amazing, though i have to admit the service was a bit slower. it slowed after we ordered our main dishes appetizers came out fairly quickly, so i cant blame the waitress likely an issue in the kitchen, there werent too many diners, as we were served after about 3035 minutes the drinks did hold us down enough to barely notice the time. since we were in a bit of a rush at the end of the meal, we asked for our deserts to go, which we came to find out always includes ice cream, so the waitress kindly offered me a gift card instead. i was happy with that, as i will definitely come back for recess.
seriously impressed. we came in for fathers day as a last minute decision, and im very glad we did.the service was rocky at first, but quickly turned a corner and i was very pleased.we ordered the pancetta deviled eggs, a bloody mary and a draft beer to start. everything was great. the marys are spicy, so if that isnt your thing be forewarned  i believe the spicier the better. it comes topped with a chicken wing would have preferred bacon and olives or something else.my husband ordered the adobo tacos with rice and i ordered the ccb with brown bag fries and sriracha ketchup. the first burger came out slightly raw. when i let the server know she was so wonderful and the manager came over and let us know how sorry he was. they sent out a new one and it was better than i expected. the sriracha ketchup had just the right amount of kick i really liked it.even though we were stuffed, we saw a lemon meringue pass by and i couldnt help but order. im so glad i did. it is probably one of the best lemon meringues ive ever had.all in all, i highly recommend this place, and ill definitely check it out for recess soon with my friends.
i really liked this place  i went in on one of the very first days. i enjoyed the unique food combinations and we tried a lot! the service was very friendly and accommodating. my favorite thing about them is the very large patio. they have spots for beer pong, oversized jenga, oversized connect four. i like where its located also. hopefully they do well! attached is a photo of the beer pong area.
this is a very cool trendy new bar! i went here for brunch and had the best chicken and waffles ever! the green chili cornbread waffles were so tasty and very original. the menu here is somewhat limited, but the entrees are unique and made from highquality ingredients. the jungle juice cocktail was a refreshing drink. they also have a nice variety of draft beer including some rare taps.
this teacher loves recess... aka, happy hour at ps702! i dig the school theme, which carries throughout the restaurant decor math flashcards clipped up around the bar and menu shareable portions are in a section called study group. theyre a theme restaurant without being tacky about it.farro  brussels sprouts salad: surprisingly filling, this could be a late lunch. the sweet curry vinaigrette is interesting and there are a lot of contrasting textures.crispy cauliflower: the breading is superthin and slightly spicy, with buffalo and bleu dipping sauces, served in a mini cast iron skillet. one of the better versions ive had, not greasy!parmtruffle frites: you know you want them. they smell great, but lets get real, everyone has fancy fries these days, right? these come with a spicy ketchup and lemon aioli. get em.speck  eggs: another dish everyone has, with the ps touch adding crispy prosciutto and a kick of spice.  nicely creamy filling.crispy ahi tuna tacos: you cant go wrong with ahi. tiny wonton shells filled with avocado and ahi, lightly dressed in ponzu. one of the lighter options, pairs well with the salad above.pbj sliders: the dish i was most excited about and the only one i was underwhelmed by. menu only states blackberry habanero jam with smoked bacon and for some reason my eyes interpreted the word slider as a mini sandwich, most likely heated, on a thick challastyle bread. its actually 3 typical sliders mini patty and bun with the two condiments gracelessly smeared on. with less pb and more j, this might have been palatable but dry beef  sticky pb  nope.all of this, with a beer and tip, for 40 can easily feed three. service was awesome when it was around, bar staff were constantly busy to the point of being overwhelmed. our server apparently went home altogether, and after nearly half an hour of waiting around to close our tab, kourtnie kindly took care of us. not sure id come back outside of recess hours, but its definitely fun. the food is approachable with some innovative twists rather than the standard safe staples i expected.
i think this might be my new favorite spot! we have now been here 3 times and have not been disappointed! the staff are great as is the atmoshpere. let yourself be a kid again and play giant jenga and shuffleboard!
yesterday my husband took me to this place. i absolutely loved the concept of the restaurant. this place reminded me so much of something i would probably see back in ny! the menu is short and simple. their drinks were good. i had the chorizo mac n cheese as an appetizer with was delicious! and i had the mash bangers for my meal. now my meal was supposed to come with chicken instead it came with chorizo, but it was still good anyways. i had a fruity drink, i forget the name, something jungle lol. it was really good but beware it is really strong. it alcohol will creep up on you. my husband had the flat iron steak and he loved it. we also had dessert. my husband did not enjoy his brownie at all. it was way too rich and dark chocolate for him. i had the nutella cookie and it was pretty good. the prices and portions are good and the staff was very nice. i would def come back and try out the rest of the stuff on their menu!
heard about this from a fellow yelper and last minute changed my plans to go here instead of cheesecake factory! im glad i made the change and so was my friend.we came in and the placed was very spacious, well lighted with natural light from the glass windows. the globes on the ceiling was very nostalgic. so were the chalk boards and even down to that weird smelling brown paper towels they used in elementary school i know they also use it at other places but still.another surprise was when we were sat down and saw the menu. the throwback to the notebook, the scanttron test menu for brunch and the napkins! once we were down with the nostalgia overload and i so wanted to grab a pencil 2 and fill in the test , my friend and i went through the menu. everything was decently priced and we so wanted to order everything but we had to control ourselves. our waitress, kaila, suggested we do the beermosa... wow. i didnt think beer and champagne would be great together but i was proven wrong. that and 10 for a bottomless, why not?we ordered the mezze plate, mac and cheese and ahi tuna nicoise.mezze plate looked like it could feed 34 people but between me and my friend we did our best. the highlight was the nice firm and not too salty marinated feta, tapenade and hummus. the flatbread was nicely grilled and perfect. downside was the babaghanoush needed more citrus and saltseasoning. the fried chickpeas was ok. but for next time i will try and see if they can accommodate a double babaghanoush and hummus only :3ahi tuna nicoise was great.  big portion. would serve 1 person for a full lunch meal but great split between two people. we were given the wrong salad initially  we were served the scallop and brussels sprouts salad... was so tempted to say yes that it was our salad and that she forgot  our ahi but we are definitely coming back to try that salad . the dressing was great. perfect citrus notes and  not too over powering. the take on the eggs being served deviled style was a nice surprise. bibb lettuce had not lost its very little crunch to it meaning the salad was perfectly dressed. the one thing we did not care for was the potatoes.  it seemed like an after thought to their composition as it had no saltseasoning. trying to mix it with the salad dressing didnt save it so we just picked around it.the fact that we had to stop ourselves with this order should tell you the portions are great. we got the bacon mac and cheese.. and man seeing those salt and vinegar chips on top.. i was in love with the dish. not too cheesey and not too dry. one of the best mac and cheeses sorry for me you guys havent beat out beechers mac and cheese.these little nuances is not the cause of the 4 star rating.  the rating mostly goes to the amount  of beermosa refills we had. you guys have definitely beat out dw bistro for my go to brunch place from now on, but the lag on the drink refills was the one that did you in. my tip to myself for future visits and to others with a small group... sit at the bar and see if they can fill up your drinks on the fly without the wait.other than that i will definitely be back along with some friends in the near future!  definitely have to come back and try the recess!
very cool spot, great for dinner or late night drinkssnacks. we got there shortly after 9pm on saturday night and it was busy! we sat in a booth near the bar and there were outlets and usb outlets on the wall every restaurant should have this!.ordered the crispy buffalo cauliflower, which is possibly the best vegetable ive ever eaten, and the bacon cheddar tots. in an attempt to be healthy, i got a tomato and watermelon stacked salad. it was just okay. my hubby got the steak, which came with chorizo mac and cheese. the mac and cheese was fantastic! not too cheesy, not too greasy, and still very flavorful. i often feel like a 70 year trapped in a nearly 40 year old body, so it was a little noisy for my taste, but if we were there at 6:30 on a wednesday night instead, im sure it wouldve been a slightly different experience. but overall great food and id definitely go back!
fun atmosphere and interesting spins on some traditional food.this space is a lot of fun and themed! who doesnt enjoy a fun back to school moment? theres books, note pads, globes and so many fun decorations. the noise level is really loud so i wouldnt recommend coming here for romance or good conversation. we ordered some liquor and the jungle juice got me a mild buzz, thanks bartender! i love it when you cant taste it but you can definitely feel it!we decided on their take of deviled eggs which had a kick to them. i prefer good ol traditional ones which i cant seem to find anywhere i go. next came the margarita pizza which again had a kick  again i prefer a traditional approach. i have to comment on the nicely done thin  crispy crust which i really enjoyed. and now we get to the charcuterie board...pretty damn great! cheese with crackers or bread and jam or honey is my thing! i cant help myself and they offered a really nice balance of mild, sweet  savory items and i enjoyed them all. our waitress was awesome tonight and overall we had a good time. im very interested in going back  trying more items. note  they have a very large outdoor patio area but we couldnt do it tonight because it feels like hell outside.
came here on a wednesday night and it was surprisingly busy. the wait for a table was about 10 minutes long  once sat the service was extremely slow : my waiter only came to my table three times once to greet, once to take my order, and once after i paid and when my pitcher of water at my table needed a refill it took a little while to get someone to refill it. i ordered the chorizo and shrimp and it was delicious! not too spicy but still had a light kick. my date got the bangers and mash and it didnt look too good but he liked it so thats all that mattered to me : the atmosphere is very great. its kind of noisy, hip, modern, chill, etc. everyone that works here is very friendly, young, and accommodating which i love! but 1 star knocked off because my server didnt come around enough times and i like when my server is alert, aware, and around.
being a frequent visitor of downtown summerlin, sephora....need i say more? when i first noticed this place my boyfriend  i decided we needed to eat there asap. we came here on a friday around 5:45 or so for happy hour. it was packed  we were told happy hour was in the bar area or outside on the patio. we chose the latter. it wasnt too hot  each booth had a fan. i absolutely love the theme of this restaurant. the menus look like the old school composition notebooks. the managers walk around dressed like teachers  i mean, its adorable. when we sat down it took a while for our server to come over to us  ask for drinks, but it was super busy so it wasnt a big deal. by the time he came over we already knew what we wanted to order from the happy hour menu which has really good choices! so we put in our food order as well. my boyfriends beer came out first, and about 10 minutes later i finally received my drink. i ordered the crushed velvet which its their spin on the classic moscow mule. it was really good, and im not much of a drinker. it had the distinct flavors or blackberry  lavender. super yummy. our food came out pretty quickly. one by one. we ordered the speck  eggs which were really good! the ahi street tacos, also good. the farro  brussels sprouts salad wasnt all that great, only because its not my kind of thing. after receiving all our plates our server went to another table. we decided almost immediately that we wanted to order a couple more things before happy hour was over at 6:30. i looked at my phone  saw it was 6:10 or so. i knew our server would be back before 6:30 so i wasnt worried. also as a side note, when we got our first plate, my boyfriend ordered another beer. but heres the thing...our server didnt come back. not to check on us  see if we liked the food, not to drop off my boyfriends beer. nothing. finally another server or runner brought out his beer....20 min later. yep. 20 minutes! what? thats just nuts. so from 6:10 or so to 6:28 we waited for our server to come back so we could order more from the happy hour menu. finally he came  we told him wed like to order one more beer, and another dish from the happy hour menu pbj sliders and something off the happy hour menu shrimp  grits. to which he responded...well happy hour is actually over right now. but ill try  see if i can get it in. i responded with but its only 6:28. i thought happy hour ended at 6:30. and he replied with the same thing: ill try to get it in. i didnt bother telling him that if he had come back to check on us before 18 minutes...we couldve put in our order sooner. i knew that if he couldnt get it in then i was going to speak to a manager. so he left our table  went to the table directly across from us where a group of women were eating  they too ordered from the happy hour menu. he told them the same thing, that happy hour was over, but hed try like hes doing us all a favor. __ and they said what i didnt want to say. well we wanted to order sooner but we couldnt find you. you never came to our table again. if you cant do it, id like to speak with a manager. he replied with ill try. alas we all got our food at the happy hour prices, and it was bomb. our server was a super nice guy. he just needs to work on spot checking his tables more often. i have to say the shrimp  grits were delicious, but the star of the show is the pbj sliders. we werent expecting them to be a mindblowing revelation. but they were. they have a beef patty, crunchy peanut butter, and habanero jelly. they are divine. if youve made it this far into my review, i applaud you. and you take away only one thing from it, please let it be this: order the pbj sliders. carry on, fellow yelpers.
we tried public school 702 shortly after they opened for business.we started with a couple of appetizers. i didnt love the calamari, but i typically dont enjoy fried calamari so that wasnt too surprising. the tater tots were the highlight of the appetizers. for an entree i ordered the cobb burger and chose the kale and brussel sprout slaw. when my food came they had given me fries instead, but quickly noticed their error and brought me the slaw. the burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors were great. lots of bleu cheese and drippy egg and the slaw was on point as well. i enjoyed my meal quite a bit. the service was very attentive. some were a bit overzealous since the restaurant just opened but i appreciated the extra effort. id be interested in coming back to try more of their menu and possibly happy hour sometime soon.
the service was fantastic! brittany was very knowledgeable about the menu and friendly. great beer selection. try the yellow smoke cocktail,
food and selection is excellent. great fresh food prepared perfectly. great happy hour deals and regular menu items still a great price for what you are getting. a few standouts the burger, chorizo mac n cheese, meat and cheese plate, tuscan kale salad, and farro salad. been there 3 times in less than 2 weeks definitely will be back.
the service is very good in a very nice and open atmosphere.   we liked tge simplicity of the menu and were so happy with our choices.  the lamb burger medium is fantastic as was the watermelon and heirloom tomato salad.  fantastic!
okay so ill start out with the bad first, the kitchen was slow and we had little particles floating around in our water and some on the sides of the glass which you can see. our server was very kind. she seemed like she was running around in the beginning, she got to our table and was out of breath. i just wanted to tell her to take it easy lol. we ordered a bloody mary half way through our meal and although it was garnished with a chicken wing we couldnt finish it because it was too spicy, salty, etc. i would say try to make the drink like more of a drink than a spicy sauce for a hickey wing. it was just too spicy to the point that we only sipped maybe 25 of the drink 4 of us were sipping on it. but now onto the good stuff! the food was amazing. we had the calamari and chorizo mac and cheese for an appetizer, i didnt get a picture when it first came out due to the fact that i was excited and hungry. the calamari was delicious and a good size as an appetizer for 5 people. the chorizo mac and cheese was the shit! never tasted any mac and cheese quite like this one, they even come with potato chips on top to give em a little crunch. next up was my entree, i had the fish and chips and to say the least it was good. it didnt have the right flavor i was looking for but mind you, it was my first time ever ordering fish and chips, so for those of you who like fish and chips and love tartar sauce, this is the place you that you should go to. next came dessert, and since we waited a while to get our food they gave us a complimentary dessert which were the nutella chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich and the lemon merengue. the desserts were outstanding! just keep in mind lemon merengue packs a little punch but it was delicious. i rated this place 4 stars because the food is awesome, and even though the kitchen was slow management actually showed that they cared about our dining experience. there are a few things that need to be fixed like the little particles in the water, maybe tone all the spices down in the bloody mary as well. but other than that i have no complaints because the food was absolutely delicious, and thats what i went there for right?! definitely a spot to check out, its on the second floor so it had a pretty cool view.
best pizza i have pretty much ever had. my dad and i went for lunch and were very pleased with our italian chopped salad and pepperoni pizza. the ambiance was fun and very well done. our service was excellent. i know some people had issues but our server was amazing. but, as usual, there were a few cons to my experience. and truly i would give this place 4.5 stars if i could. cons: loud. loud. loud. if i had been with my friends having some cocktails, i wouldnt mind but being that i was with my dad, it made any lengthy conversation difficult. electrical outlets at the table. thats right you technology obsessed folks out there. there is an individual outlet at most tables with usb ports. im sure this is a huge thumbs up for most but this freaked me out and made me sad quite honestly.  managers? there had to be at least 8 men walking around in these plaid shirts with their super important ipads and things in their hands just tapping away and meetings over here and meetings over there. i was just so random and so bizarre.but, none of this had to do with the food or service and lets face it, thats why we go to a restaurant. so hands down, i will be back.
ive decided to make it my mission to try all of the restaurants in downtown summerlin, and next on the list was public school 702!this restaurant was very cute and charming, with a schoolhouse theme throughout. it appeared that they were training new employees when we visited for lunch, as both the hostess and the servers were shadowing other employees. everyone was cheerful and pleasant, and aside from the newbies asking a few questions of the more experienced, it didnt detract from the service at all.we settled on an appetizer of the cheese and bacon tator tots. they were yummy! deep fried tator tots, with bacon and cheese inside, served with sirracha ketchup how can you go wrong? for my main course, i got the ccb, which was their version of a cobb sandwich. it was a chicken patty, served with lettuce, avocado, bacon, and onion, with their own special sauce. it was yummy! i loved the bread too, although it didnt hold up too well by the end. their fries were good, not great thin fries, but again, that sirracha ketchup helped add a little kick.my friend enjoyed his burger as well, but i didnt get to taste it. they have a vast selection of beers, if you are into the brews, and what looked like a really fun outdoor area.another downtown summerlin restaurant checked off the list! i wouldnt mind getting detention here, though!
read all the reviews and ordered  some as directed.  the shrimp and fried grits were a hit.  a little spice but not overwhelming.  hamburger good, fries o.k.  fried cauliflower was exceptional.  pizza was very good as others have said.  our service was very good, and it was very busy for a tuesday night.  we had made reservations on line.  the manager came out and spoke to us, all were friendly.  we will return as we dine out once per week and like to have different experiences.  two in our party had beerhard cider and enjoyed those.  water was plentiful for all.  atmosphere was fun with many partying at the bar.  inside or outside dining.  enjoy!
nice atmosphere , ppl were kinda bland but environment made up for it, seating was very unique and confy. the food wasnt quite filling but i enjoyed it
having wanted to try the original downtown la location for the longest time, and just never getting the chance to, public school 702 was probably one of my more anticipated restaurant openings this year. this new location in downtown summerlin sits on the upper level between crave, and the yet to open second shake shack. its a pretty large space with a lot of seating, a good size bar area, and an outdoor patio as well. but even with all that, it gets busy, and youll likely have to wait for a table. for just 2 people at 7:30 on a wednesday night, the wait still tipped 30 minutes.after being seated, we were handed their regular notebook style menu that has a quite a few appetizers, and all kinds of entrees from burgers to chicken and waffles. we were also handed a separate list of their current rotating tap beers. thats one of my favorite parts about ps702. not only is there normal beer list all craft offerings, but their rotating stuff seems to be filled with unique and even some hard to find limited release stuff. if youre not a beer drinker though, theyve got plenty of cocktails and wines too.since there was only 2 of us and pretty much every appetizer on the menu sounded good, we decided to get a few items to share, and then split one dinner. we started off with some of the smaller items, the speck  eggs, and the crispy buffalo cauliflower. at just 6 for either of these, they are must try starters in my opinion. the eggs were perfectly boiled, had a creamy yok filling, and the little piece of proscuitto was a nice salty, crispy touch. and the buffalo cauliflower was excellent. weve had a few different versions of it at other places in california, where it seems to be more popular, and ps702s was excellent. its got a thicker breading and was served piping hot with sauce on the side, instead of tossed.the other appetizers we tried were a little on the bigger side. their mezze plate is huge for 8 and includes 5 different things to pick off or dip in, and huge stack of thin, crispy pitalike bread. my favorite things were the marinated feta, and something i had never had anywhere else before, crispy chickpeas. we also really enjoyd the chorizo mac  cheese. it was the most expensive starter we got at 9, but well worth it. the pasta was cooked perfectly, its super cheesy, theres plenty of chorizo in it, and even though i thought it was strange at first, the salt and vinegar chips on top added both flavor and texture.by this time, we were pretty full, but our order of the fried jidori chicken  green chili cornbread waffles was already on the way. sadly, it didnt impress nearly as much as the appetizers, especially with its 22 price tag. i personally really liked the slightly spicy waffle with the cornbread like texture, but the wifey wasnt a fan. and even though the flavor on the chicken was excellent, it was mushy and only one part, a leg, was bonein. the gravy had good flavor as well, but because the chicken was soggy, it made the whole dish just overly mushy. had the chicken been crispy, this would have been a huge hit for me.unlike a lot of the other reviews, our service was excellent. we even found out later on during our meal that our waiter was in training. he did an excellent job though, and no complaints from me at all in the area.ps702 is a little on the pricy side, especially when you get drinks, but its not out of this world crazy. with both of us getting drinks, then adding on 4 appetizers and a main entree, we only spent about 90 with tip. besides the main chicken and waffles dish being a bit of a let down, it was well worth it, and ive got to say ps702 is one of my new favorites in downtown summerlin, so i cant wait to go back.
great place. my friend and i walked in, sat at the bar and we were promptly taken care of by bryan. he informed us of the happy hour specials, and made us delicious cocktails all night. hes a great mixologist. great service at the bar.next time will try the food and outdoor fun.
loved this place!  after hearing very good things about public school 702 from others, my wife and i went to this new addition to downtown summerlin for the first time last night, and brought friends along from out of town.  it was definitely worth the time it took to drive downtown to get them, then drive back to summerlin for this dining experience.with its school themed decor, the atmosphere is unique enough that the interior doesnt look like just another gastrobup and bar.  the vide was happy across the entire restaurant, with everyone looking like theyd waited all week to finally be there.  im not sure why, but it was noticeable and different than many other comparable places.  the waitstaff kept active all the time.  i never saw anyone stop, and although we had a dedicated waiter, several others would quickly swing by the table to take empty plates away, bring more water, etc.onto the food:  delicious!  i had the grilled salmon with summer succotash, my wife and one of our friends had the huntsman burger, and our other had the shrimp and grafton cheddar grits.  the food was hot and perfectly prepared.  everything looked fantastic when they brought it out.  the succotash with my salmon was the best ive had anywhere.  tell you what:  this was definitely not public school cafeteria food.  ill definitely go back and try many of the other dishes on the menu.beer:  lots of craft beer choices with a standing list in the menu, plus another sheet at the table of beers theyre temporarily featuring.  of note, they had at least one sour beer on the menu.  id only recently heard of this kind of beer and was pleased to see sour options available in a place that features craft beer as a part of the dining experience.  you really need to take a look at the menu to see all your standing beer choices.definitely make a reservation when you go.  we had a seat near the window and could see a line forming at the door periodically as people waited for a tables to open.  you can make a reservation right from the restaurants website or through yelp worked great!.  to the restaurants credit, the hostesses seemed to work through the line very quickly every time it built up, although i couldnt tell if folks were queuing up waiting for any table, or for a table they reserved.we sat inside, but noticed theres ample outdoor patio seating overlooking the more scenic part of downtown summerlin.  the option to sit outside is always a plus!take note, its loud inside.  not ridiculously loud, but the larger size of the dining area tied to a lack of decor that would help muffle or absorb sound fosters a fairly loud environment.  even so, it wasnt a detractor.  even though this is definitely not a public schools cafeteria, the volume may remind you of those days when you and your friends were carrying on conversations in the buzzing school cafeteria.  again, not a problem; just know it going in.  this isnt the place for a quiet, intimate date.one small misstep i chalk up to a restaurant still finding their stride: no salt and pepper on the table, but it was quickly remedied when we pointed it out.  well definitely go again.  and again.  if i could, id give them 4.5 stars right now, and assuming public school 702 hits its stride they way i think it will, dont be surprised to see me update my review to a five stars after another visit or two.
came here with two of my girlfriends to check it out and we loved it! the atmosphere is really cool and we loved the fact that the games outside gave us something to do rather than just stand around a bar.  we only got drinks but we peeked at the menu and will definitely be back to try it out.  i got the jungle juice which was really good and they both got beers which were great! the bartender was very helpful, giving us suggestions and samples.
my husband and i had a feast at public school 702 on a monday evening during happy hour. happy hour specials are available in the bar area and outside on the patio monfri from 3:30pm  6:30pm. we ended up out on the patio with a nice view of downtown summerlin. im thanking my lucky stars we stumbled in here just in time for recess.  crispy cauliflower 4 hh: the favorite of the evening. according to the menu, its supposed to be served with blue cheese dressing and buffalo sauce but we only got the blue cheese. the cauliflower is amazing! id highly recommend getting an order of these. 55 parmesan truffle fries 4 hh: a large portion of flavorful fries, but neither of us cared for the lemon aioli. they tasted better straight up! 45margherita pizza 6 hh: lightly dusted with red pepper flakes and a pinch of basil leaves. would have liked for there to be more basil and less charred black dustiness on the crust. 35crispy naked wings 6 hh: came with 7 or 8 goodsized wings and my guy thought they tasted great. we learned public school 702 does not serve ranch and that their sauces are made from scratch. 45chorizo mac  cheese 7 hh: sans the chorizo so we could both share. the vinegar potato chips layered on top added an unexpected crunch, as did the surprise arugula. the mac  cheese was slightly spicy because of red pepper flakes in the dish  wise choice. 45   fountain drinks 2.75 hh: my husband ordered a coke and it came in one of those cutsie bottles. unfortunately, refills are not free. the extra coke was 1.50. what are we, in europe? i just had water, and our server left a nice vase of water at the table so i could get all the refills i wanted. 25vibe: public school 702 has a class act theme, complete with menus that look like old school notebooks, chalkboards displaying the specials, and an awesome galaxy set up that would win any science fair competition in the main dining area. this new gastro pub feels industrial and trendy, and i love it here! 55 service: selina was an awesome server! she checked up on us often and was super nice. 45worth a return visit?theres still so many happy hour menu items im dying to try. and, i will definitely get the legendary nutella cookie dessert yelpers are talking about next time i visit! two thumbs up public school 702.yelp 100 challenge 2015: 187
this place is generally good. the only things  i will complain about is that is sort of half upscale sports bar and half casual fine dining sort of weird but it works for them. also because of the half sports bar atmosphere there are tvs which play sport and loud people screaming at the tvs and it gets extremely obnoxious especially since im paying 60120 to have a meal there. the pricing is in no way in line with the atmosphere they have crated. although the theme is cool, ill give them that.  i think the food is good but overpriced for sure probably because its downtown summerlin but id say definitely worth trying out be prepared for a meal for two to be at least 60 thats the minimum. i had the salmon succotash it was good but it was a bit too lemony for my taste and it said grilled and i though it was more blackened but maybe my definition for grilled is different. i finished my meal. i paired it with a red wine cabernet which went nicely with the salmon. my boyfriend got a huntsman burger which he enjoyed but he said the ketchup it came with was weird and too spicy for his taste mine too i tried his burger it tasted good and was seasoned well not 20worth thoughall in all its good but no better than like yard house or something and way pricier too.
turn down the music please! its not a night club. when a round table of 6 young people cant hear each other talk, its more annoying than enjoyable. the server got 4 things wrong and i think its because she couldnt hear us!!! the food and drinks are good, so the next time we eat here, if we cant sit outside, we will just pass.
any restaurant that can handle a huge group of 14 crazy people who havent seen each other in three years so they are all talking over each other and sharing stories while the waitress is taking orders is awesome in my book.  and that is just what public school 702 did.  they did a great job of managing our table, our requests, and our one food complaint my friend was upset that he only got 4 shrimp in his shrimp and grits while i got around 10.i realllllllllly like the food here.  the brussels sproutsfarroscallop salad is so flavorful and light.  it is a huge portion to boot.  the shrimp and grits has a nice grill to it, and the cutting board is a good mix of meat and cheese.  i liked all of the apps except for the calamari, which was just soso. i have tried three of the cocktails on the menu, and none of them were fantastic to me.  i was a little disappointed in their drink menu, but their full bar and nice selection of craft beers well makes up for it.the space itself is such a cute theme with napkins that look like lined paper, to the menus that look like composition books, to the library wall inside the restaurant.  there is ample seating, a large patio, and even beer pong and jenga for socializing.  great spot for groups, a happy hour, or a date.
we were quite excited to eat here, the menu looked right up our alley and its a gastropub.  the dining area is very loud, if you want to be able to hear each other sit outside.  the outside area is very nice, great view. theres misters and fans.  the music needs help, but i just blocked it out with good convo. the service here is good, we didnt get utensils but they came after we asked. the guy seemed new to serving, which is fine, we got the right order and drinks were filled.  the food was pretty good, not slammin, but delicious. we had the tater tots and chorizo mac and cheese to start.  the tater tots were very greasy, hardly any crunch and lacked the bacon flavor they were supposed to have. they missed the mark on that one, but the idea was good, if they could execute it they would be great. the tots just fell apart and were mushy. the mac and cheese had a sausage chorizo, and had big kettle chips on top.  it was cheesy but i love that crunchy bread crumb topping on mac and cheese, and it didnt have it, the chips just fell off and were useless. i wished they also used ground chorizo, that stuff is excellent when mixed with gooey cheese.  for the main courses we had the shrimp and cheddar grits, this was really good.  great sauce, it was light, and the grit patty had a nice crunch to it.  they did that right, awesome. we also had the short ribs.  they were a bit fatty, but the meat was very tender and great flavor. it reminded me of a meal youd have at home on a holiday.  the mashed potatoes were sitting in a nice gravy, and they give you plenty of meat.  they also put some crispy brussell sprout chips on top.  they were really good.  nice and salty with a slight char. all in all it was pretty good, they have some kinks to work out, but its a great place to eat outside and have drinks and food. if they play some good music itll be a hip hang out. id go back for sure.
great atmosphere, great food, reasonable prices. a hip and trendy place to go with friends.went there for a working lunch. the bacon  cheese tater tots and the deep fried cauliflower were delicious. sauce complemented both appetizers well. i ordered the lamb burger; it was cooked perfectly and wellseasoned. it was delicious. the side salad was a little bitter, and a blemish on an otherwise excellent meal.bottom line: make it a point to go back to school. youll be glad you did.
food and service was really good! i wished they had more of a selection of food for the lunch hour. will i be back? yes. but i will need to come and check out their dinner menu. i also loved the location of this restaurant. prices are affordable too which is a plus in this city!
just checked out this new downtown summerlin spot.  i would highly recommend it!  it had a very cool vibe, the service was very friendly, and the food was excellent!pros: food was great!  service was friendly, outside area was very nicecons:  inside was very loud, they were out of a few beers on tap, overall, very well done, definately a place i would go back to!
when i finished work one day last week, i met shannon  the family for dinner for my visit to public school. i had never heard of ps before, but when i arrived, i fell in love with the decor and ambiance. as i was walking towards ps, i could see my boys waving to me through the glass wall from the balcony. what a wonderful welcome to a new hot spot. the food was good  the server was the best server we have had in a long time. i admit, i had an event later that evening, so i arrived late joining the family for dinner at ps  left early to go to my event, but my experience was really good. i liked the food and im looking forward to going back again soon so i can write a more detailed review.shannon  the grandparents werent as impressed as i was. we all agreed that the tater tots were the best item we had. and the kids meals were extremely small.
mini yelp gathering with some of my favorite yelpers in vegas. most of us was the first time dining at public school 702. including me never been but for the most part only heard great reviews! it one of many restaurant in downtown summerlin. off topic say love love the fact downtown summerlin finally filling out all of the retail and restaurant spaces. i still remember first open walking around like is anything open. back task at hand. so we had big party so got to see decent amount of food off the menu. no reason but good one for us. the kitchen cooked up extra appetizers so found home at our table. i got try the devil eggs, and bacon cheddar tots. not sure if extra or someone on the table ordered it but crispy buffalo cauliflower. the presentation not only for all for the table or appetizers thought was well done. i like the incorporation of cutting boards. to the little cast iron servers for both the tots and cauliflower. i think both of them use the same breading cause looking the same. it nice golden brown outside, hot on inside, and fried goodness. the tots admit enjoyed the best out of the three. i enjoy the combination of bites of bacon and the cheddar all combine in one bite. the other two never ok but nothing special. the eggs really liked the presentation the most out of the three. my entree went with the fried jidori chickem  green chili cornbread waffles. it been while since had fried chicken and waffles. the last time was down south in atlanta, ga. it was pretty darn good. public school 702 took fried chicken and waffles another level. the fried chicken not your normal wing and thigh pieces. i enjoy mixed it up then traditional. they incorporated chicken tender meat with the breast. still have the wingdrumstick. one of the things that stood out for me once got the dish. the hot sauce had on top of the chicken but not completely soaked in it. the batter they use fan of big time. i love the crispy crust. it has ton of flavor and the meat inside on all the pieces was cooked perfection. the waffles adding green chili not just plain waffles. yay! f could would order each one separate just double the amount. when put both together then throw some of the bacon sauce or whatever in side dish. unreal delicious. memorable. hearty. no doubt heart attack. once in while want indulge heavy not good for your health dish. this is the way to go. i wanted to try the sirachi ketchup mustard sauce with the brown bag of fries. the fries are just that fries. the sauces are devine. the honey mustard sauce that could use for spread on any sandwich. the sirachi one of my stable condiments and fan of. it was tasty. if want take fries another level make sure use both the sauces. everyone else dishes on the table looking good. i got try the truffle mac and cheese. i like it!!!! it had nice balance between the truffle and cheese. it came with the steak dish i believe. i know your can order for side. the staff is awesome. our server she was amazing. there was nine of us she on top of it. explained everything for the first timers like myself. made great suggestions on the menu. friendly. i know lot of times big parties restaurant reluctant split checks. she said not problem at all. think two or three appetizers lucked out got for free. thank you public school 702. i will be attending class again sooner then later............good stuff!!!!
arrived for brunch and was immediately greeted. the dining area was full so we were offered the community seating or the bar. we chose the community seating. our server was great, very funny. gave us multiple suggestions and offered his opinion on multiple dishes and beers. the decor was cute, a bunch of things related to being in school encyclopedias, flash cards, gloves and chalk boards, etc.. i was pleasantly surprised when the female staff wasnt running around in skimpy school girl outfits like they would have been if this was located on the strip. i had the smothered breakfast burrito. it was very good. the avocado that was on top was a little old you could see some brown spots. the eggs, cheese and tots on the inside were cooked to perfection. the chimichurri sauce that smothered the burrito had just the right amount of kick. mike had the chicken sandwich. he loved it. the chicken was moist and the sweet carrot habanero aioli was spicy but good. if youre not a fan of spicy things ask for light or on the side. it came with a choice of few sides. he chose the fries that came with sriracha ketchup that was absolutely amazing. in terms of drinks, mikes first beer, old rasputin,?was extremely small and it wasnt a good pour at all. the second beer, dawn of the red, was a good size and good pour. the third beer, wookey jack, was in a small glass once again but it was a nice pour. overall it was a nice place that we will try again, maybe for the happy hour that everyone has raved about.
very good for happy hour. nice selection of food at good prices. very good beer selection and decent wine choices.  service staff was a bit overwhelmed during happy hour but theyll work that out. great service for brunch. the regular menu is available plus a too small brunch menu  some additions to that would be welcome. great vegetable hash. the french toast tasted terrific but the bread could be thinner and the bloody mary mix is delicious. definitely worth trying if youve not yet been.
good food. loud tho hope da food is tha same. they have my wife drinkin beer lol food had been beyond expectation so far
our dining adventure continues through downtown summerlin. public school 702 offers brunch on weekends along with the regular menu. the restaurant is a large space with an enormous outdoor patio. indoors the room has high ceilings and hard surfaces but was conversation friendly. at check in we requested a booth and only waited a few minutes for one to be cleared. service was prompt with our server offering water while we perused the menu.. refreshments include bottomless bloody marys and mimosas. if you drink more than two it becomes a money saver. review the large chalk board at the entrance if you are beer lover.we chose the ahi tuna tacos as a starter. there are four to an order with avocado salsa, and lemon aioli served in crispy wonton shells. the ahi tuna was fresh and flavorful. the shells provided a nice crunch.chicken sausage  cheddar grits are on the brunch menu and come with two fried eggs, blistered tomatoes, grilled corn, bacon, greens and a beer sauce. the chicken sausage has a little heat and the entire dish is a nice mix that will fill you up. grilled salmon with summer succotash is on the regular menu. our server did not ask the degree of doneness for the salmon, however it was prepared to my satisfaction, cooked all the way through with nice grill marks. the salmon is served with roasted  vegetables, edamame, corn, squash and citrus butter.public school 702 has a happy hour in the bar and extends to part of the patio. since the patio faces east i would recommend it for when the sun move across the roof and adds some shade. ceiling fans help with the circulation. the beer menu has a wide variety of choices. a return visit is a must to further explore the offerings.
i agree with a few others reviews in that its loud! they seriously need noise dampers. its also very bjs, yardhouse, cheesecake factoryish style menu. but i feel like the food here is pretty good. service sucks but thats just vegasesque. nice happy hour menu, beer menu changes weekly... overall im a fan. ive been multiple times. wish they had more tvs tho. patio in the springfall will be a good time.
well we found a new favorite dining experience. we had the buffalo cauliflower, tater tots, speck and deviled egg, chicken and green chili waffle. it was awesome. i now have a new way to eat cauliflower. sheena our server was really engaged and knowledgeable. we actually came back today to try other menu items.
i liked ps 702 for the most part. we came for lunch which worked out as there was a small wait if you came after 12. we were seated right away and i commented how big this place was. the menus and the napkins definitely fit in with the theme so good job on the details. now on with the goodies...i couldnt decide on what appetizer i wanted to try. i ended up picking the mac and cheese over the cauliflower even though the hubby said i could get both. however, being 9 months pregnant i can only take a few bites and feel full. i already decided before i got there that i would get the fig and prosciutto pizza. my other half decided on the bangers and mash. the food came out fairly quickly luckily because i was a lil hungry. the fig and prosciutto pizza was good, but a bit spicy for this preggo. i didnt know there was a bit of a spice factor and i wouldnt have ordered it otherwise. it was good, but i wish there was more of a fig taste. i couldnt see any fig bits or really taste it so that was a lil disappointing. i didnt try the bangers...only the mash. you know me and carbs! it was a good sized portion for lunch and the price definitely was well worth it. it was gone by the time i was done eating so i assumed it was delicious or my husband was really hungry. ; as for the mac and cheese i really liked the kale in it. the ladies next to us kept eyeing our mac and cheese and i told them they had to get it next time. not a big fan of the chorizo but thats what your eating partner is for!overall, i liked this place and the atmosphere. i wouldnt be afraid of bringing my kids because it is fairly noisy so other people wouldnt notice if your kid was talking loudly. service was great in the beginning and at the end our server was no where to be found. granted it was the lunch rush so just be prepared for a bit of a wait if you go during a rush.
this place was really really good!!!!! we got the tots, calamari, huntsman burger, and the ccb. we also tried the temperanillio wine, a local ipa beer, and this blackberry moscow mule type of drink. everything came out in a timely manner, the interior was beautiful, and all of the food was amazing!my only complaint was the soggy burger bun, and everything was a bit pricy for what it was but this restaurant is a very typical hipster restaurant.overall i will be back to try the rest of the beer and to try everything else!
its awesome that summerlin finally has a good gastropub!  this is a great place to get together and get some good food.  we had the following:beers:  they have a seasons selection that changes, if you cant make up your mind you can get little tasters.  i ended up with this golden ale that tasted more like a guinness but with coffee flavors.  interesting tasting beer for sure.chorizo mac n cheese:  awesome!  were fans of salt and vinegar chips so to top off the chorizo mac n cheese with that just added that extra pop.  it does have some greens, kale, but its hardly noticeable for those non veggie lovers.grilled watermelon and heirloom tomatoes:  surprisingly this was a great refreshing plate for the summer, definitely a winner in our book.chicken and green chile cornbread waffles:  heard a lot of great reviews for this, but was a bit disappointed with this one.  the chicken was pretty tender, but the waffle itself was pretty dry and a bit hard to eat without extra gravy and sauce on top of it.short rib:  this dish was delicious!  tender short rib draped over the mashed potatoes with some grilled onions.  this came out steaming hot, but the flavors were on spot.nutella ice cream cookie:  a lot of reviews about this one too, we liked it for the most part but after a few bites it gets too much.  its a decent size so if you have a group of four it would be perfect to split.  the nice thing about this dessert is the ice cream has bacon bits for those bacon lovers!overall the service was great, we had a super friendly waitress.  she was helpful with suggestions and also joked with everyone when she came to the table.  well definitely be coming back here!
tried public school for lunch today and our experience was fantastic! im sure it can be a little loud during meal hours, but we enjoyed the atmosphere and had a great meal. their beer selections are on par and loved the crispy chicken sandwich! phenomenal service staff from hostess to our waitress vanessa. if you want some solid beer recommendations  shes your girl! great time, will be back to try more dishes and to explore the mixed drink concoctions.
great food great beers. service is hit or miss at times. has improved tremendously since the first week they opened. the patio is impressive and big.
went for happy hour with friends. they have a good selection of well priced drinks and appetizer type specials. chicken wings delicious, truffle parmesan fries good. service a little slow but they were very busy so understandable. we will return to try more things.
i was very excited to try public school 702 at downtown summerlin!this restaurant was very fun and charming there is an overall schoolhouse theme! all the staff was pretty friendly and helpfulthere was a group of four of us and we were not starving, so we decided to have a few things to share amongst us .... bacon cheddar tots with a sriracha ketchup these were deep fried tator tots, with bacon and cheese inside, served with sirracha ketchup chorizo mac  cheese emmental, cheddar, kale, sea salt  vinegar crunch hand tossed pizza house pepperoni mozzarella, provolone, crushed tomatoes, jalapenosi really enjoyed all of our choices and would order them again!
public school 702 is located in downtown summerlin. the restaurant is huge. the ambience had school related stuff from books around the restaurant and their menus resembled composition books.  we ordered the calamari and macaroni and cheese for appetizers. the calamari was pretty good but not life changing but the mac and cheese was worth remembering! it had chips on top as a garnish. i found that interesting. we also ordered tacos, a breakfast burrito and an egg hash. everything had great flavor. their presentation was really nice!
the food was pretty good, there is this awesome citrus beer. but what makes this place truly special is by far one of the best wait staff that i have experienced in vegas.  grace is soo attentive and knows the menu backwards and forwards and certainly gives wonderful recommendations!
my husband and i were out shopping with our daughter and my mother in summerlin. i had heard rave reviews about this place through a few coworkers at the wynn. we decided to try this establishment with my two year old. fingers crossed it was perfect! even the kids meal presentation was on point. i had the steak salad and my hubby had the fish and chips. very good. ambiance was not too loud but just enough to drown out her fun that she was having. we are looking forward to going back this week for a little date night. the menu had a great amount of options and the decor was well thought out. food was very fresh. hoping that this restaurant opens up another location soon!!! please go check it out. well worth the money.
awesome and fun place to eat. really liked the admisphere.  the decor and the menu really took me back to the good old days  of school. the waiter that we had was a lot of fun. he gave us quizzes. haha, loads of fun.
came here for girls night  enjoyed it very much. this restaurant is located inside downtown summerlin. the decor  the concept of the restaurant were both aligned very well as it made you feel like you were in school. my girl friends  i sat on the patio, it was lovely. the food was great  was brought out with little wait. i give it 4 stars because though the food  the restaurant was great, i feel that our server could have been better. she spoke really fast  was somewhat short with her answers. didnt really smile at us which made it feel like she didnt really want to be there. other than that, everything else was perfect.
great new restaurant at downtown summerlin. food is good, nice craft beer list and unique spins on the traditional cocktail. the atmosphere inside and out is fun with beer pong, big jenga, shuffleboard and tvs. service can be a little slow at times and if you sit by the bar it will be loud.
having came here for the first time, i picked the wrong time to come. 5:30 pm on a friday...its cougarville city here. the inside of the restaurant was packed, no seating at all, and the noise was deafening. i was glad we were able to find a seat outside. even outside was getting super packed. if tables were full, people were sitting on the arms of couches or standing. our server, vanessa, was incredible. honestly, its been awhile since ive received such good service. she was great with beer and appetizer suggestions. and, as they were so busy, she let us know that things would take awhile to come out. what a concept! i feel that more waitstaff members in vegas need to be doing this! its an easy to set realistic expectations and enable diners to plan accordingly. drink orders, as warned, took awhile. but i was surprised how quickly everything else came out. our total order was two rounds of beers and two appetizers: buffalo cauliflower and mezza plate. they make the mezza plate with white bean hummus. so, if you are a hummus hater, do not despair. try this instead! the buffalo cauliflower does live up to the hype. get it. dont think, just do it. although, im really not a fan of the chunky blue cheese dressing that goes with this. added bonus: our waitress noticed we had too much humus and not enough bread and brought more out free of charge. thank you, vanessa, for the amazing service!
four words  chipolte mac  cheese.  hands down this is the best mac and cheese ive had in my entire life!!  we had the mac  cheese for an appetizer  then for entrees we had chicken and waffles and the huntsman burger.  the chicken had fantastic flavor and the cornmeal waffle was awesome!  the huntsman burger was underdone and the char on the outside had nothing to balance it out like strong cheese or sauce so it was a bit offputting.  i probably wouldnt order it again. for dessert we had the brownie  the nutella cookie sandwich.  the nutella cookie sandwich was twice the size of my burger and the pecan brittle was amazing!  i really didnt taste the nutella due to the other flavors but i would definitely get this again and share it with 3 other people.  the brownie was less brownie and more fudge  it was very dense and the top of the brownie seemed to have dark chocolate icing.  not being a fan of dark chocolate i wasnt a fan but my husband liked it.  overall, we would definitely come back... and i might just order the mac  cheese as my entree!
very nice atmosphere, feels almost like youre in a different city when youre here. the chorizo mac and cheese is delicious, but certainly one to share as an appetizer. they have a decent selection of beer, but i wouldnt come just for that. the best part was the chewy nutella ice cream cookie dessert we got. however big you may think it will be, double the size in your mind because it is huge. we shared it between four of us and didnt finish it. the cookie is really very yummy, chewy and moist, with the perfect amount of nutella on both sides. the vanilla bean ice cream in between was not as flavorful as it looked, but all in all was delicious. the only con was that drinks, including beers, took a pretty long time to get. for all of us who ordered drinks, they all took a noticeably long time to get to our table. other than that, not really any complaints. the server was very friendly and knowledgable.
such an awesome place and the service was on point. i was a little disappointed to see that their menu was not more expansive but still found great items to eat.their menu seems to me to be more about their beer and drinks. the ambiance is great and would be an awesome place to hang out, eat, and drink with friends without having to go to the club. we sat on the patio area of the restaurant and it was beautiful. the conversation was good, so we didnt realize that our food hadnt come out for an hour. our waitress was very attentive and was actually the one that brought it up to attention. they came back up to us to apologize and bought another round of drinks for us. awesome save public school 702.
this is a great place for a night on the town.great atmosphere. inside is a little loud for the large group we had. we could not hear across the table. outside when weather is nice would be great. they have beer pong, jenga, etc.. tvs outside to watch sports, great small bar outside hidden in back..will go back for nighttime drinks on the patio.
really, really cool spot!  i met a friend at downtown summerlin since she hadnt been there.  we decided it was way too hot to hang out outside.  the mall was completely dead and we quickly realized everyone was in this restaurant!  it was happy hour time, but i had my 3yearold with me so we couldnt order off of that menu since hh is only for the bar, obviously.buffalo cauliflower: yum!  i normally hate mayobased sauces, but this had so much blue cheese in it that i kept dunking.grilled watermelon  tomato salad more like a stack:  my favorite thing.  very refreshing and flavorful with some sort of white cheese it looked in the shape of white chocolate shavings...tasted like feta sort of, but cant confirm because the shape of the cheese shards confused me but they were good.  plus balsamic and oil drizzle.  loved this!chicken  waffles:  the waffle is chile cornbread!  very yummy.  it said there was syrup on it, but i couldnt tell because the chicken was saucy and the cornbread was savory.  it was good, but i felt it needed more sweet syrup to give it a true chicken  waffles experience.we almost got the fish  chips, but decided against it because my kid wanted it and it was on the kids menu.  we thought we could just try a bite of hers.  when the kids meal came out, it was a ridiculously large bowl of fries, with 3 small pieces of the best fried cod i have ever had.  the texture of the coating was insane, and the inside fish was still perfectly cooked i hate when it dries out and is over cooked.  we took one of my daughters pieces and my daughter ate the other two.  she hardly ate any fries.  then, she wanted more fish.  great.  it was 8 for her meal, and i had to order more fish for her...but this time i said no fries regardless that i had to pay 8 again because it was just a waste!  other than being annoyed at spending 16 for my daughter to have enough fish  chips our fault for taking one of her pieces, everything was great.  very filling, indulgent meal.  not expensive either.oh, and the service is great!  at least our experience.  our server was a tad slow but it was busy in there so he had a bunch of tables im sure.  but even the servers who werent ours were super friendly!  my daughter kept playing peekaboo with them since we were near the orderentry computer station, and every single one of the servers gave her attention and talked to her.  very cool, i was impressed.
even though my husband kept referring to it as a damn hipster restaurant, we both really enjoyed the experience and the meal. we had a great waitress to start things off! her name is vanessa, she wasnt a total foodbeer snob, she made great recommendations on the menu, and made sure we had a positive experience. we started with drinks, my husband is kiiiiind of a beer snob so he enjoyed the selections. i had the crushed velvet and loved it. great drink, freshly made, superb balance of alcohol and mixer. i was super impressed. we chose the buffalo cauliflower for our appetizer, and it was awesome! flavorful batter on the cauliflower and extra buffalo sauce if you wanted to make them spicier. i highly recommend this appetizer to everyone. i got the the huntsman burger for me entree, and it was good. a little undercooked but im cool with that. very hearty, and the carmelized onions help balance the flavor. my husband had the wild mushroom and telaggio pizza. he loved it! again, great balance of flavor. we finished off the meal with the nutella ice cream cookie with bacon brittle. yum. dont need to say much else. it was a really positive experience and i will definitely be back. the only con is that the music is really loud. or maybe im just getting old.
my friend  i visited this place last night. loved the patio. great menu. food was good. i have to agree with other reviewers, the bar service was extremely slow, over 15 minutes for a beer and a bloody mary!! our server made up for that by including an order of the deviled eggs which were good. we will be back. hopefully the bar will get their act together.
i love the atmosphereeverything has a school like theme. youre also allowed to sample a beer before you buy it, which is great. pretty crowded during hh but a fun place to check. out.
public school has my attention. we had the parmesan truffle fries, margherita pizza, pbj sliders,  the chorizo mac n cheese. walking in it was louder than we expected it to be. classic cafeteria chatter echoing throughout. they didnt do the best job explaining howwhere to sit, but our wandering caught the eye of someone who ended up being helpful. its a make friends atmosphere which grew on us. the pizza was our least favorite  luckily it was also last. not quite sure if its simply because it paled in comparison to everything ahead of it. pbj sliders are a must! that habanero jam makes it! chorizo mac n cheese was good the vinegar crunch was the best touch. the texture of the chorizo set it off a bit... tough  chewy. not sure if that was just ours or how it is, but good enough to go back and try again!we also had the dawn of the red by ninkasi brewing co  slight hints of pineapple, mango, and papaya. an adventure for your taste buds!i was on assignment so i had to check out happy hour items only but i was eyeing a watermelon dish that i will update w name later.overall good time, good taste. atmosphere gives you something to automatically talk about a
public school 702 is a very unique restaurant and bar.  i absolutely  love  the  theme and decor of the restaurant, which embodies the whole school theme.  i can only imagine  their happpy hours  here.the food selection at the restaurant  is very typical : burgers,  pizza, fries, and of course  drinks.  their brunch menu contains a limited number of breakfast items; however their chicken and waffles  are good.  i also enjoyed their endless, well almost endless  styles of mimosas.  overall,  this is a fun and exciting  restaurant and bar  to hangout at.
made a reservation here for lunch as i was advised to by two different people.  this was the best advice as when i arrived a group in front of me had to wait. i didnt. : upon looking at their menu online i was worried as it didnt show prices. to me, this usually means its going to be expensive. the menus took me back to my school days as their brunch menu was a test scantron and the regular menu was a composition book. being as it was lunch and i wasnt feeling breakfast so much i went with the bison bbq burger. at the beginning the servers were attentive, but closer to the end of my meal, they stopped coming by as much and i waited a while for the bill.my burger was tasty.  however, i didnt taste any bbq sauce which i was rather disappointed with. the cheese ratio was astounding! usually i feel restaurants skimp on the cheese, but here it covered the whole burger. it also came with a side of fries and sriracha ketchup.  the fries were ok, and although i cant eat spicy the ketchup was addicting! the atmosphere in the restaurant was nice. they played reggae tunes which made me feel like i was at home in hawaii.  the decor was eccelectic and kept my eyes wandering. i had a great experience here and would love to come back to try other foods and their beers.  i hear they have a great happy hour.
nice atmosphere from the moment you walk in the door. great view from the outside balcony! great beer selection and helpful, knowledgeable staff. nice menu and several rotating selection of beer as well. great addition to downtown summerlin
we really enjoyed this place! the happy hour was awesome! food was delicious and unique. the drinks were also excellent. however, the service needs help, our waiter was mia when we needed cocktail refills several times. and we wanted dessert but he never came back to take our order, so we just said okkaayy i guess well skip that. his tip would of been much bigger had he stayed on it! overall, great place and well go back hoping to get a better waiter.
located in downtown summerlin. ok so they may not win any awards for service, but i will say this, the weekend brunch almost bottomless bloody mary for 10 is quite the deal the bloody mary is garnished with, among other things, a chicken wing, allow me to repeat that a chicken wing!!!!!  also try the beermosa. i will say theta they have a very good happy hour as well. its worth a stop in, get there early on the weekends and avoid the crowd. live it up you are in las vegas for cryin out loud!
went on a friday night.  approached the host stand and were quoted 40 minutes.  after some thought we decided to put our name down and have a drink at the bar.  keep in mind we almost left because of the long quote.we sat down at the bar and were given menus immediately.  after the menus went down the attention went away.  it seemed the staff behind the bar was more interested in sampling the beers on draft than they were servicing the patrons.  we finally were asked if we had been helped and put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and ordered a cheese platter.  after 10 minutes at the bar we were texted that our table was ready...??  definitely the door needs help quoting parties accurately.  we had to cancel the cheese platter and went to our table outside.the outside and inside are 2 different animals.  the inside was very loud and reminded me of a college bar atmosphere.  the outside was much quieter and enjoyable.we ordered the cheese platter, the hummus platter, and the chop salad.  all dishes were great and portions were more than enough.  the server was very friendly and noticed my wife from another visit.  only issue i had was that she spent too much time chatting with other tables and it hurt the refills of our wine and ordering process.there seemed to be a lot of staff at the restaurant.  all in all i loved the food and the concept is unique.  if given the choice and the weather is favorable go for the patio booths.
i only give the restaurant four stars because they seated us in an area without a server. we were ready to leave but our server tyler saved our evening. the restaurant gets four stars but tyler gets five stars. we were not in his section but he ensured we had a wonderful meal!
labor day. expected it to be crowded, and it was. the great thing about public school 702 is its size. even while busy, like today, you cant tell it is because the tables are spread out nicely to not give the appearance that its  bustling.ive been here a handful of times since its opening and have never been utterly disappointed with the food. its just good bar food but does not blazea trail of culinary excellence or originality. service always seems to start off a little slow but due to team service model, once the order is in, food and drink get out at a good clip.that being said, this is a review for weekend  brunch service. the brunch menu is more interesting that the regular menu, and we enjoyed it much more. flavors were bold and serving sizes were huge.  we had the jidori chicken and green chili cornbread waffles and the chicken sausage with cheese grits. the chicken and waffles was one of the better interpretations of this classic dish. the waffle was more savory, and the slight heat from the green chili offset some of the heaviness of the dish. the chicken sausage and grits were good and plentiful stuffed with wilted kale, cherry tomatoes, and topped with an over easy egg. the menu didnt indicate that it would be spicy but there was definitely some heat in the vegetable mixture, which i appreciated.  paired with the grits, it was a very filling meal. i wouldve appreciated a biscuit or some piece of bread to sop up some sauce, but then again, i may have had to wear a biscuit since i was so full.for those with kids, this is a good place to eat some grown up food and appease some kids boring palates. they have a kids menu with the standards  mac and cheese, pizza, chicken, cheese burger sliders, etc. portions are large a couple of young kids could share a pizza but its not the cheapest kids meals either. noise level isnt too much of a concern because theres always a game of shuffle board where the banging of the pucks sound like large wood planks slamming against each other. its a good choice for the whole family and especially if youre walking around dt summerlin. cool inside dining and if eating outdoors is your thing, they have a nice patio, but most of the view is parking lot and a little of the water feature at the north end of the mall.
this place is good! im glad they opened one up here in vegas because i really liked the one in downtown culver city in la. this one is much bigger and the food is decent. the huntsburger was really good, i also liked the succotash and fried cauliflower. nothing thay spectacular but overall a quality gastropub lol.
we visited on a tuesday night and sat in the bar to take advantage of public schools awesome happy hour.the good: 1 service was wonderful; 2 the decor is very cute, even if its a little heavyhanded. i love a good theme and i like it when a business really commits; 3 those pbj sliders are money; 4 huge beer selection.the bad: 1 the deviled eggs and kale caesar were no bueno. the eggs were bland and the salad was really sweet. unexpected with a caesar and not in a good way; 2 the bar area gets really loud so conversation can be a challenge.the final word: really unique spot in downtown summerlin. its worth a visit and, in my case, a second visit. i went on a tuesday night and the bar was a sausage fest. on a saturday night, this place must be a single ladys wet dream.
service has definitely declined on visit 2. food is still awesome!!! cant wait for service to return to normal....
made reservations which was needed on a saturday.  very funky old schools atmosphere with text books the menu look like composition notebooks.   everything was good..the cheese and bacon tator tots were just ok and husbands lamb burger was suppose to be medium rare and was medium well...but he doesnt send food back so his issue.   scrimp and grits were interesting the grits were more of a palenta cake not grits fresh corn was perfect!    best item on the menu was the cutting board with chef selected meats and artisian cheeses with the most delicious fig jam!
cool spot. great food with a pretty impressive beer selection. lots of seating including outdoor options for when its not 100 degrees. i will define;y be back.
my dad and i paid a visit to public school 702 last night to check out the new brews that left coast brewing released. my dad is a bit of a beer connoisseur so trying new beers along with some good food is right up his alley. the new beers were being launched at 7 so we got there early enough to enjoy happy hour, or recess as they call it. right off the bat i noticed they had a nice selection of craft beers and our server jared was extremely knowledgable when my dad expressed his desire to try a new stout. we ordered so many different beers during happy hour and the left coast tasting that i dont remember what we got but everything was delicious! now for the food: we got the speck and eggs which is a deviled egg with prosciutto on it, the mezze plate which consisted of pita bread with hummus and baba ganoush for dipping, crispy buffalo cauliflower with franks hot sauce and bleu cheese for dipping, and sliders. for me the sliders werent anything special but i enjoyed everything else that we got. my only gripe about the cauliflower is the dipping sauces. this place markets itself as a gastropub so it would have been nice to see a sauce they create themselves.overall this place gets a thumbs up from this girl and ill definitely be back!
had a very fun time here. the energy was uplifting and positive as the servers all looked to be enjoying their job. the service was outstanding. amanda was our server and she made our time spent there very pleasurable. she was very knowledgable about the menu and drinks, and was more than willing to explain items as well as offer beer samples. the grilled watermelon was excellent. had a burger which was cooked just the way i ordered it. i can see this eatery only getting better. they are off to a great start. will return!!
stumbled across the awesome spot while wandering downtown summerlin. even though they were busy they sat us quickly. our server melissa was great. never ran out of water, checked in on us in reasonable intervals without being bothersome. everyone was friendly and seemed to be enjoying where they worked. i ordered the flat steak with the chorizo mac and cheese for my entree and we had the tater tots as an app. those tots are feeling amazing. you will want to order more than just one order its seven in a single order, so if you dont want to end up in a fork war or having that awkward moment when there is only one left... the steak was incredible. it came out exactly as i ordered it and no steak knife was necessary which is an amazing accomplishment for the cooks, as flat iron steaks can be very tough. there was just the right amount of truffle butter on top and just delicious. the mac was also very yummy. so much so that my mum decided she would just eat mine. now for dessert! if you are a bacon lover, and who isnt? you need to order the cookie ice cream sandwich! right now! it is epic. i mean... nutella spread, chocolate chip cookies, vanilla ice cream encrusted with bacon! and 6 bucks! i will definitely be returning when im back in vegas.
good food, good beer, big jenga, shuffleboard, what more do you want?  the service can be hit or miss, but has been great the last 2 or 3 times we have been there.
first thing i noticed about this place is how awesome the environment is to the name. the napkins are like school paper, the menus are composition notebooks, and all over the restaurant it feels like an old high school. its really awesome!our server was very friendly and well informed on the menu. she made a lot of good suggestions.i ordered a pizza. it was good, not great. but overall i liked it. its worth a shot. i think this place deserves at least 4 stars even tho at the time they dont have it. not sure why. i had a great experience!
a mixed bag. the tomato and watermelon salad was amazing as was the fried chicken and waffles. no issues with the food at all. the service was wonky. it was early, 5:00 on a tuesday, and they couldnt seem to figure out who was supposed to be waiting on us. we plan on giving it another shot because the food was great. beautiful space too, and fortunately it was mostly empty when we were there because i bet it gets crazy loud when its full.
great atmosphere to enjoy good food, appetizers, drinks and the different genres of music playing in the background. clean, sporty, relaxed, fun environment for family night, first date, group meal, etc. excellent location just walking from downtown summerlin mall.
went here for drinks with a friend what a cool concept! they have live music outside and the inside looks like you walked into your high school! the specialty cocktails are very yummy! especially their version of a moscow mule!!!
had to check out this new cool place like yard house but better atmosphere. the service at the bar was very attentive at lunch time. my chicken sandwich was crispy, with lots of good stuff inside. overall, i would return.
second time. after getting the cold look at wp, next door, i got excellent service and grilled salmon here.... glad i came....
great atmosphere, fantastic food...lots of different appetizers like grilled watermelon stack which was delicious!  i ordered the lamb burger and loved it!  i just wish i could have a cup of decaf coffee!
public school 702 has the type of refined brand youd expect from a chain restaurant, which it is, but manages to feel more like a smallscale, chefdriven spot thanks to a modern menu and great craft brews. as a gastropub, youll find pub and bar fare that will hit the spot like bangers and mash consisting of snappy chicken and herb sausages and a hearty bacon brussels mash. other top dishes include chicken wings with a crackly, crispy exterior; the adobo tacos that come with two roasted chicken and two short rib tacos; and the massive farro and brussels salad with pan seared scallops.they serve brunch on weekends, too. their french toast varies, but the blackberry lemon curd version i tried was equally sweet and tart. even better was the fried jidori chicken and green chili cornbread waffles. well seasoned with a thin, crispy crust, the chicken sat atop mildly spiced, savory waffles covered in a gravy full of bacon bits. topped with a fried egg, the brunch version differs from the one on their regular menu which has more chicken and no egg.unfortunately, some dishes fall flat. i wasnt a fan of the broccoli or salt and vinegar chips in the mac and cheese. and, the grits in the shrimp and white cheddar grits dish was too soupy and runny for my liking.their beer list changes frequently, but theyve had some great ones on the menu like jommegang by ommegang a belgian style dark ale and parabloa by firestone walker a russian imperial stout.service has been solid the few times ive gone, but the restaurant is so large, with a long rectangular layout, that you can see servers struggling to race to the bar to pick up drinks, race to the kitchen on the other end to grab food, and race back to the tables. i think all the servers act as food runners and bussers too so the amount of work they have to do isnt conducive to great customer service. its an issue with management and the layout more than anything, but often reflects poorly on the servers.
overall, the food was quick, tasty and had character! i definitely recommend ordering the crispy cauliflower, its something else. the service was wonderful, but i really recommend making reservations so you dont have to wait a long line!
located in downtown summerlin...we went during the 1st anniversary of downtown summerlin. it was crowded everywhere. we had a 25 minute wait even though many tables were open. the waitress said that they didnt expect too be that crowded today. it was not a problem because they take your cell   text you when your table i s ready...so we walked around the art festival  farmers market. it was worth the wait! both our meals were delicious! i just wish i had room for the nutella ice cream sandwich :
a great place to hang out, delicious apps and entrees, fun ambiance, and their watermelon mojitos are amazingly good!
this place was the bomb, and several yelpers and i went after an event.great beers, and great company.  havent tried the food yet, but would love to do it.   whats awesome though are the people.  the wait staff is actually amazing.  granted that it was a monday night and there wasnt too much going on but theres not many times that a waiter is walking past, and were talking about dating sites... and he just enters in the answer to the question we had.i mean, thats what you can call service!what can you say?   the live music was decent.   the only thing that i think they need to do is to drive a bit more traffic on the offnights.   perhaps there might be a yelp event in the future here?hard to say.  im just saying....  if the staff that served us, did the tables for a yelp event.. you know itll be great.
think about yard house but with a school theme, better food, and a more limited drink menu. location  atmospherelocated in downtown summerlins little circle of restaurants and random rock formation fountain, public school 702 gives off that perfect local hangout vibe. its always poppin every time ive been. the restaurant itself is very large and they really stick to the schoolhouse vibe the menus are super cute composite notebooks!. its obvious public school 702 is a recent addition to an already successful chain of restaurants. i love that they make each location unique to its area code, including the menus.serviceif service was amazing this place would definitely be a 55 in my book. it can get very unorganized and since the employees are dressed casually its sometimes difficult to tell who is who. in addition, some of them are not the friendliest people and i sometimes feel like im burdening them when i keep having to get their attention.however, some servers are super friendly and go above and beyond. it really is hit or miss here. one cool thing is that you can get samples of any of the drinks! they bring you a little shot glass of beer to try things out.food  drinktwo words: cutting. board.i dont know why im so obsessed with it but the cutting board 14 appetizer charcuterie plate is just bomb to me! its a combination of the delicious cured meats, cheese, and thin crispy bread. they meld together so well! also love the onion and capers. its so worth.also the ahi tuna tacos are amazing. i have never liked those kind of newfangled tacos ill stick to my adobada and tripa, thank you but this one had the perfect amount of freshness, delicate fish, and thin crisp. it just melts in your mouth! 10 gets you 4 tacos.i had a couple other dishes but none of them really made an impression. as for drinks, i have only tried a few of the craft beers on their menu. campfire stout is alright but i was happy to see they carried ninkasi dawn of the red. the bill can get a little costly here depending on your appetite for food and alcohol but sometimes its worth the splurge, especially if you get to sit on the balcony on a nice evening. i have yet to hit up their happy hour but will definitely come back soon!
food was good enough to warrant a return in the future. service was ok, the two of us stood for a few minutes when we first arrived and the restaurant was not super busy, but they had us seated within 5 minutes. the hamburger was awesome. ground chuck, super tender and juicy with an egg. cant beat it. beers are a little on the spendy side, and i didnt like the one i ordered, so probably wont be doing that again. not for 8 bucks anyway. the bacon cheddar tots were really good, dont even tell me what the calorie count was! dont need to know!
good happy hour specials. this place can get extremely packed! i enjoyed trying the buffalo cauliflower for the first time. and their jungle juice is amazing!! ill be back! good place for a crowd.
went there for the first time last night. weve tried to go once before but the wait was too long. decided to try again but earlier. arrived at about 5:00 and still had to wait 2025 minutes for a table. however, the wait was worth it. we sat on the patio and the view was great. i had the chicken and cornbread waffles. it was awesome. we will definitely go back.
brunch options are great. relaxed atmosphere on the sunny terrace. chicken sausage, eggs on grits was very tasty. oj was fresh squeezed. server not too attentive though.
food is delicious and locally sourced and the beer selection is pretty decent too! my friend was on a diet and asked for just chicken and shredded romaine lettuce, no dressing... no anything but they charged her 16, which seemed ridiculously steep. if the pricing was more appropriate, i would have given this place 5 stars.
very solid four stars. our food was excellent and five stars were possible if not for the smallish portion of salmon on one entree.  shrimp and grits were 5 stars. 17 and a very hearty portion. interesting presentation with the grits in a cake like state at the bottom of the bowl. very tasty. excellent beer selection. very good service. there is beautiful patio seating, however, we did know about it when we got there and sat inside. lighting was too bright for me in the  bar area.
i used to go to the public school in downtown los angeles many times since ive lived near it. the decor here is a lot better and more spacious. happy hour has more of a variety and priced very well!  i wouldnt suggest bringing kids since its more of a bar scene. also when i went to visit it was more on the quiet side so no one was sitting in the main dining room.
perfect place to hang out with your friends.service: 10 1 to 10 each menu served by different server  all of them served with a big smile and make us feel so happy place to be.  very positive energy.food  9  all of them excellent, except pizza too salty for me. we had a happy hour menu  10.00 for one liter red or white wine. tuna taco, parmesan truffle fries, mini cheese burger, deep fried cauliflower, and pizzabathroom  10 cleanwe suggested to manager, like to have a hook under the table to hang the purses. i dont like put my purse on floor next time  sitting a dining table for a dinner.love this place!
the food is so reasonably priced for how unique and delicious it is. they have an amazing happy hour menu. everyone who works there is so polite, patient, and strangely attractive... i love sitting outside because it can get a little loud inside, especially with the music.
the cauliflower buffalo bites are delicious. ordered them each time weve come and they really are tasty. did not care for the humus plate, it wasnt tasty or creamy. it was more like peanut butter consistency, rather than creamy. the happy hour specials are decent. decent portions, decent prices. definitely get the cauliflower bites, those are delicious.
first time today and it went very well! went around 230, wasnt busy, so we got seated quickly. unfortunately we were too early for recess love thathappy hour.interior: very cute motif, loved the menu! waiter: didnt catch his name but he had a ponytail and glasses, haha, but he was awesome! one thing though, although i love the ketchup and sriracha dip that came with my food, he should have asked if i wanted regular ketchup or the ketchup  siracha, you know, just in case ppl wouldnt like the combination but i mean... its siracha! jk... maybe thats why he didnt ask..whod reject such a thing!? when i told him he should hook it up on more sauce, he did and suggested a bbq mustard sauce that would go with my food but i thought it tasted better with my brothers pizza, but i appreciated his incentive.food: i got the colorado lamb burger medium rare, omg. it melted in mouth. i thought it was delicious! loved the savory from the lamb and the sweetness from the jam together. my brother got the pizza which i thought was okay. a friend got tortilla soup and sliders, didnt get to try the sliders but it looked dry and she said it was ok. i got a taste of the tortilla soup and the flavor was light where ive had tortilla soup blasting with flavors, i mean, it wasnt bad, but just not what im used to? pro: they have dishes with kale, quino, and cauliflower, and other things if youre feeling something more healthier? i preciate that too :.  they have a childrens menucon: i kind of wish there were more selections for nonalcoholic drinks though, but i understand that its more of a pub kind of thing, but i was craving strawberry lemonade or other fruity, carbonated drinks. i mean, since they do serve burgers, maybe shakes? haha.
really like this place! great vibe, food, atmosphere and drink selection! good happy hour!
the food in this place is fantastic. weve been twice now and i got the huntsman burger both times... with bacon of course. i cant get over how delicious it is. my boyfriend got the bison burger once which he loved and got the salmon which was perfectly cooked.  we also had the buffalo cauliflower which fits great info my current cauliflower obsession.  my favorite thing, though, may be the brussels sprout slaw.  im trying to recreate it at home so i can have it all the time.  the beer selection is awesome and fun.  the servers are ok but sometimes adapt the hipster attitudes on top of the dress code. this isnt brooklyn; you can keep the clothes but lose the tude.  the biggest complaint... its too frickin loud.  not the music it would be great if i could hear that better because they have a good playlist.  its the crowd noise that is overbearing.  i hope they find a way to lower it but with the ceiling so high i doubt its possible.  im sure its nicer out on their huge patio.
just had some apps and a beer or two.  i was bummed that they were out if the two beers i wanted to try. i will definitely be  back.
i stopped by with my cute little girlfriend kim because she was being a hungry little baby, and it was beyond my expectation.  the business gave off a similar vibe as other public house themed pubbar but had better tasting food, better quality cocktails, and more interesting theme than the others.  i expected something like yardbird, but it was much better.  and the bartender, kallie, was proficient in her mixology. well done. i would definitely come back next time im in the mall. if there was something that bothered me, it was the fact that they had on a tv channel on surgeries, the nasty kind. puss popping and liposuction. disgusting choice for a place that serves food.  my little baby had to run away to the bathroom while all patrons were screaming.  i gave four stars as kim said it was unforgiving for a restaurant to make such mistakes. i would change the review if no such thing occurs next time.
i took the lunch group to public school 702 in downtown summerlin today! it was so much fun. great atmosphere. our waiter was excellent! everyone said their food was wonderful! reminds me of the yardhouse at red rock but the food is much better!
great service and delicious food. my friends and i came in for brunch and let me say i love this place. everything was flavorful and came out quickly. plus 10 for almost bottomless mimosas is such a deal.
stopped in on sunday for some beer, apps, and football. good experience here,  or waiter was cool and always checking on us. overall a good experience, well be back for sure.
went with the wife and a friend for dinner and drinks. the beer selection is unique, interesting and tasty. the deviled eggs were not your traditional deviled eggs but were very tasty. the bacon cheddar tots were god as well. the spaghetti and shrimp and grits were both good as well. the bison burger was a bit disappointing. what really impressed is that our friend left her leftovers behind and the waiter chased us down outside to give them to her. he definitely went above and beyond and it impressed me. we will be back.
great place for a group or just two. menu has something for everyone. nice servers good food and atmosphere. fun for any occasion!
enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and the food was great!
great good. great drinks. great atmosphere. great views. come here on a nice day and enjoy the outside seating.
its a great place to enjoy a fun night with friends especially in the balcony, the food is good but they are changing items on the menu all the time so you dont really know what to expect
the decor and service are awesome. went during brunch. 4 for draught beers. got a smothered burrito. looks fancy and not that much but its tasty and filling. solid.
interesting place with an interesting theme. decent service. i went on saturday but the dj there was absolute garbage and really misjudged the atmosphere of the place. none stop techno  drum and bass for an hour? no thanks. public school just doesnt seem like the place for that. i would go back to public school again but probably not on a saturday. apparently its the same dj every time.
been to public school twice.  the service is great and food is exceptional.  we will definitely go back!
im so glad they opened this poke shop next to our house!!!  i miss poke so much since we moved to the mainland...im glad this is so closeservice: is amazing always very friendly reminds me of the island, talk to the og auntie my first time here, she is the bomb!poke: first time here they had a limited menu and where out of spicy poke...even on the islands if you didnt get there island you werent getting the good poke so people crying about them being out of poke is on them....if you are from the island you know you have to get there early to get the poke you want....the shoyu  poke was bomb better then i thought...today we tried the spicy poke and it was good, but i have had better.complaints: for a local shop who got huge from the locals, kinda crazy they dont have kamaaina or even military discount.keep the good work going and the yummy poke and we will keep coming!
my boyfriend and i went for their soft opening and we were not disappointed. i ordered the shoyu chicken and it was delicious and the portion was worth the price. it came with three chicken thighs. my boyfriend ordered the chicken katsu and mind you he always orders this plate every hawaiian restaurant we go to, but he was very impressed with their katsu and the sauce. this place is worth trying and my boyfriend and i will definitely be going back
i actually really like this place. i wasnt expecting much but i was happy i went. a lil pricey but food is great.
onolicious !loved the shoyu poke  mp  but great quality.bbq combo excellent, lau lau goodhoping they will have poi and chili pepper water next visit.gonna go back for sure and try the bentos and lots more.
tried this place one more time after their grand opening.  i was pleasantly surprised.  the shoyu poke was much better this time.  no scales.  no major stringy pieces.  still pretty darn tasty.  my daughter had the meat jun and from what i am told it was tasty.  although their prices are still quite hi yes pun intended... what do you expect for landlocked las vegas?  i will need to try some other things on the menu!  if the owners are reading this  as a friendly touch to the female cashier and the older gentlemen cleaning up... you can talk to the customers!  because if you dont it just makes you seem unfriendly.  a hello and goodbye, and an occasional thank you would be great.  just a thought.
visited my mom in vegas and i told my mom i was craving some poke, she took us here and i really enjoyed their shoyu poke even though the price was a bit too steep. i will come back again but maybe to just buy half pound, 1 lb was about 20.
the corner of bermuda and silverado is the place to be. fresheasy, walmart neighborhood market, bank of america, eco cleaners, 711... i am always driving by or going to one of these places when running errands.i decided to try kahuku poke the other day after staring at it every time i stopped by walmart for the past few weeks. i got a 12 lb of the shoyu poke to go and it was a little shy of 10. i recall the lady working the register to be pleasant and it only took minutes to receive my order!the tuna is marinated in a nicely seasoned soy sauce based ponzu sauce with sliced onion and chopped green onion and is incredibly soft!! it is marinated to perfection  the tuna literally just melts in your mouth. tuna is cubed into large pieces and only a very few bound to happen had a chewy white stringiness to it.the tuna tasted fresh and not at all fishy. later found out they never use frozen fish, its always fresh and shipped in daily! its a little pricy for the portion but not at all an issue because i was thoroughly satisfied with the taste. i look forward to trying their other poke next time!
recently came here to get lunch for my boss and i since we wanted hawaiian food. the meat jun was pretty good and the portion is a good size. my boss got the 1lb ahi poke. i liked that they were just freshly cutting the ahi but im taking a star since the seasoning has not really soaked into the fish yet when i got it. overall good food and will come back :
try the tuna poke! the cashier even offered us a sample tasting of the salmon poke which was also tasty but as usual we went with our favorite the ahi poke. the prices here are a little more than the average hawaiian spot around vegas but the portions are way bigger! my boyfriend and i got the ahi poke bowl, short ribs and pork katsu! yum and we were sooo full! we cant wait to go back for the poke bowls again! the place is clean and the cashier was very sweet and informative. we got there around 6:30 and while we were eating the place got pretty busy, youll have a little bit of a wait for your food but its most definitely worth it!
first time here an i should say i was impressed. the quality is there the portion is perfect. the menu is not over done like some hawaiian establishment that ive been to here in vegas. over all a nice place to have a meal!
the good: pork katsu plate has huge portionsroast pork is one of the best i have had: fork tender and juicy!the bad:poke was ok for a place that calls itself kahuku pokelomi salmon is ok but needs to be lomied and aged a day or twokim chee needs to be fermented: as it is, it is like eating salted cabbage with some pepper kick.the ugly:pricing is high
their portions are huge and worth the price!! the only down fall was they were out of limu for their poke and i was really looking forward to it.
came here for lunch didnt order any poke. just wanted meat jun and kalbi. but again i ordered 3 plates. dam those tastebuds when they cant get along.anyway the meat jun was delicious so was the kalbi. the bbq chicken and mac salad were good. the mac was a little plain but not horrible. the laulau and kalua pig were both moist and flavor full ,so no complaints from the family there. the only disappointment here was the lomi wasnt very fond of it.i ordered the saimin also and ate the whole thing. not to salty like some of the others out there. so i enjoyed it.the staff were great and helpful. so no complaints here.
this is owned by the former rum runner owners, and all the favourites from there have been brought in. wild mushroom soup, boxty, and other things! nice atmosphere and a bunch of the old rum runner staff make it cozy. only open until 3pm daily. one star is lost because there is no air conditioning right now and its very hot in here, but otherwise awesome!
food did take a while to come but im not complaining. i was watching the game! i go for the seafood every time. its a no brainier and never disappoints.  plus my waitress hooked it up! love hooters!
nice location adjacent to the pool and with a patio! before meeting some friends for food  libations to celebrate their opening, i played some video poker at the bar. winner!great selection of poker games that arent common at bars, including 5 cent games. good to know! great service at the bar, and its a nice circular bar layout. this is billed as the worlds largest hooters  and the double meaning wasnt lost on me! youll have to see for yourself if they live up to it.we ate on the upstairs patio and it was a nice, rainy night. we had the standard hooters fare of wings, boneless wings and dessert. the wings were tasty especially when i added hot sauce and i really loved the peanut butter pie! perhaps this outlet will last longer than the previous one or two or three.
on 11 13  15 jessie was our server she was nice got our order hundred percent right she did take good care of us with a little request.way better than the girls from hooters at hooterscasino  b t w  the missing start in the one of the hostess  buttocks she was leaning by the hostess podium should be working for 20 hours straight with no break ask the other  girl to give us a table after a she asked us ...do you.....want ... to seat ..at the ...bar..well luckily jesse make the night up will be back
ive seen the new sign from afar every time i walk down sennott for the past few weeks, but i never felt the need to check it out. i heard that it replaced wingharts, which is another place ive never been to. what brought me inside was a sign out front that said half off appetizers from 812 when i was walking right by it. it was 8:30, so my friend and i thought why not?there were a few people sitting on the deck and within, and since it was hot outside, we sat inside at a table across from the barits not that big in there. the bar is long, and there looked like they had quite a few beers on tap. sitting down, the bartender brought us menus, and somewhat disappointingly, there were maybe 5 or so appetizersi shouldve taken a picture of the onesided menu. i remember onion rings, mac and cheese biteswedges?, are all that i remember. i wasnt really feeling any of those greasy ones tonight, so we looked at the other items on menu: wings, flatbreads, burgers, salads... i shouldve taken a picture of the menu... at 712 for most of the items on the menu, my friend and i were iffy about what to get. being typical college students, we were thinking comparatively of what else we could get on campus for that same price. however, a few of the items sounded interesting, like bird, cow, pig a flatbread with turkey, brisket and bacon and the salads. for another 6 it read, customers could add a meat item to their salad. basically double the price. i ordered it without. my friend ordered the panther burger i cant recall the description... the wait wasnt long before the bartender brought out our food. the burger sat on a small dish by itself, and my salad was on a goodsized plate. both looked pretty good.i like to eat my food without the side sauces first; i believe some foods taste can taste good without the addins, and when it does, its impressive. im the type to eat sushi without soy sauce.i could not tell what exactly in the salad that made it taste amazing. there was feta cheese, olives, artichoke hearts, lettuce obviously, maybe it was the hummus? it didnt need the two sauce cups of dressing. it was surprisingly really good. my friend tried it too and agreed, and said the same about his panther burger.maybe ill come back and try something else. and take a picture of the menu.
i was originally going to go to raising canes next door but noticed ll had a new location cause of the sign twerling guy. so decided to check it out and order one of my regulars chicken katsu and fries with no rice and extra mac salad. everything came out fresh and they brought the food to my table within 10 minutes of placing my order. i will definitely return.
perfect for fighting burger boredom, fast fresh grill and big portions. been coming here for months and its always been spot on. bbq mix plate is my goto, though lately chicken katsu is winning me over. made fresh so dont expect food coming out quickly.
great service, and super tasty food! i hadnt had hawaiian barbecue in ages, and i was looking for some sustenance before driving a couple hours to my next rotation, so this really hit the spot! i like that they had the usual, as well as the healthier options! i had the grilled chicken plate with brown rice  greens. it came with 2 packets of ranch dressing  a container of sauce on the side. prices are really reasonable, portions are generous  super filling, and the staff was very friendly  courteous! good spot for a quick meal!
been eating ll since i was a kid in hawaii. had garlic shrimp and it was ok. shrimp were battered with garlic sauce drizzled on top. mac salad always on point and many varieties of hawaiian suns, aloha
i got my fridge in the garage repaired. happy with the results so far. owner was easy to get a hold of and efficient. we have one more part to repair and that should be done tomorrow. if anything goes array i will update but would definitely use this gentleman again. proud to support veterans.
prepare to be smacked in the eye sockets with a fist full of beautiful. the powerful punch is mirrored in delicious caffeinated beverages. my choice: a latte of course. they offer so many different types of milks its surprising. my man went for a coconut milk latte and was filled with immediate regret. no bueno. so beware of that hiccup. they serve sandwiches, salads and buttery desserts because, hello, youre in mtl. the vibes are sunny and chill. id definitely work in this spot all day long if i could. or hang with pals. its alllllll goooooood at tommy.
endroit absolument magnifique, vraiment le decor en vaut le detour! un cafe hyper lumineux ou prendre un delicieux cafe entre amis ou etudiertravailler un peu. les tables sont disposees sur 3 paliers  on voudrait y rester pendant des heures!chaque fois que jy suis allee jusqua maintenant jai eu droit a un tres bon service. bon, cest un peu lent, mais ca va! jai eu loccasion de gouter au latte et a deux varietes de sandwichs, et tout etait vraiment bon, surtout le sandwich aux charcuteries italiennes et olives piquantes. le cafe tommy propose egalement patisseries, viennoiseries et jus biologiques. il y a beaucoup de choix pour ceux et celles qui ont la dent sucree!seul hic : les prix sont assez eleves, meme pour le vieux montreal. 4  pour un biscuit, 10  pour un sandwich, 3.75  pour un croissant, alouette!
situated in a historical building british empire building in old montreal tommy cafe looks very appealing.the cafe presents coffee classics such as croissants, sandwiches, juices and of course different types of coffees.i personally tried a large cappuccino presented italian style in a glass which i found really nice. good coffee, perfect milk combination.my 11 year old son tried a beautiful french croissant that he found was good, not too crusty, not too soft. he also tried a dose fruit juice named zest  of course he enjoyed that.the setting is a mix of a european look with a kind of madman touch  the mix works.so all in all, tommy cafe doesnt reinvent the cafe, but does make it very appealing.
magnifique interieur, un des plus beaux cafes a montreal a mon avis, je le cote bien du au niveau architectural  design, les prix sont chers expresso  biscuit  8,05, varietes de cafe, expressolattescappuccinoschaismacchiatoscubanos, ils ont aussi des viennoiseries  sandwichs. lendroit etait remplit de gens autant des touristes que des montrealais. service ok sans plus. le wifi est gratuit. bonne pause cafe ^^45 visite en aout 2015.
jai pris takeout, mais mon allonge etait tres bon et le croissant au choco etait tres genereusement fourre de nutella, alors jen suis tres satisfaite.
the interior is a beauty, perfect place to study. but. prices. i guess its simply explained by the art that we call coffee! quality is good! the mocha was yaass and the cronut a croissant donut! was crunchy and nutella all over and oooh yes! a delish! but beware! its a coffee shop, so everything is overpriced, except for a kiss, which the menu says its free. so yeah, neat and cozy, good food, warm drinks, beautiful neighborhood, everything is spot on! oh and the music there!!! old songs!!! studying there was perfect! simply a stunning place. if you decide to go to the starbucks nearby, dont, this place is cozier and same price, fancier and better music and comfy!!!
we had an excellent dinner. the chef spent time with us describing his dishes and just talking with us. it felt like a nice dinner with friends. they offer indoor and outdoor seating. our food was very tasty.
we loved the old place, il nido, but this is a fantastic transition. the place is small so reservation is a must. they are new so still working out some kinks. we split 3 things. beet salad, the cheese ravioli and the lamb chops. all 3 were amazing. the big negative i had here was the service. it took forever. i think they have a small staff and a small kitchen, however you would also think with a small number of tables you would have a lot of attention. not the case. so if you do go, plan on at least a 2 hour dinner.the food is amazing, just be prepared to wait.
wooohooo i won a free meal voucher from yelps 2015 charlotte restaurant week giveaway to aqua e vino so i was super excited to try this place out. free food is basically my favorite thing ever. making a reservation was a bit of a process. i am a spoilt millennial and it has been ages since i made reservations without an online option. it took 3 calls but we finally snagged a sunday night reservation they are not typically open sunday but made an exception for restaurant week. basically as soon as i received the certificate i eagerly pulled up their menu. i was bamboozled by that amount of unfamiliar italian words so i did extensive googling before we reached the restaurant. turns out all the wait staff were happy to answer questions on the menu. they provided complimentary bread and marinara sauce which were both delicious. i started with the bresaola cornet which was my first time eating bresaola and robiola cheese and they made a completely delicious combo! the boyfriend was adventurous and ordered the fritto piemontese  sweet bread, polenta, sausage, apple. i had never had sweet bread before either and the sample i had was interesting and tasted better when combined with the apple. the sausage was amazing! for the main i ordered the catch of the day pesce al cartoccio which was a tropical fish i had never heard of. it came wrapped in the parchment sheet it was baked in. this was a novel experience and i am still unaware of the proper way to unwrap a meal. the fish was good but a bit dry but the vegetables baked under it had a great flavor. for dessert he ordered the mixed berry tart and i had the pesche farcite both of which were excellent. the entire meal was an adventure of new tastes and everything was wonderful. we will definitely return!
i liked the quaint setting of aqua e vino in strawberry hill. the chef sent us donuts as a filler because the kitchen was a bit behind. nice touch. the donuts were more savory than sweet, but good. the wine list  aqua e vino is extensive hence the namesake? and i ordered a glass or two of red. we shared the octopus as an appetizer and, for my main meal, i ordered the salmon w butternut squash.my food was well cooked and presented well. i consider aqua e vino a pretty food restaurant with relatively small portions, hearty prices, and a smallish menu. it feels like a special night out restaurant and you could see and taste the chefs talents. i didnt love the hard bread personally which is probably an authentic italian restaurant bread choice but i dont need the extra bread anyway. :great place for a special night or date. make a reservation!
there are so many restaurants in montreal that i wish to check out but sadly i dont have enough time or frankly money if we are being truthful. for the part 3 years, the octobernovember event of mtl a table has allowed me to get to certain restaurants at a reduced price which i am very thankfully for. when i first looked at the restaurants participating this year, the one that leaped off the page for me was lili co. originally a small plateau restaurant, partners catherine draws and david pellizzari moved into a bigger space on saintlaurent earlier this year. reading the big reviews they have gotten over the past few years  including a most recent one in the gazette in july  lili co.s use of offal and offcuts really intrigued me and had me pinning for a visit. sadly, the mtl a table menu didnt have any of that  unless you paid a little extra  but i still wanted to go and give them a try.visually, lili co. is a nice clean space. the main focus is on the two wraparound bars which circle both the bar area and the open kitchen where you can watch chef david and his crew do their work. in fact, outside of a few spots  including where we were sadly!  the entire room is set up to face the kitchen. service was quick and efficient. noise level was pretty loud given the room was full. as such, there was background music throughout the night but i honestly couldnt tell you what it was. it is not the most fancy room around but sharp nevertheless.i felt like a cocktail this evening so i tried one of their seasonal specialities  the sans nom dautomne  zubrowska, cachaca, natural apple juice, teapot bitters and star anise. i like this one in theory but the flavour left me indifferent. the sweetness of the cachaca and the apple juice were not noticeable. i was left primarily with the bitterness and the zubrowska  not really i had hoped for.with the cocktail consumed, we moved on the food. first up was the pork belly served with cashew butter and creamy coleslaw. a generous peace of fatty pork with a nice crispiness to the skin. the creamy coleslaw paired well with the meat. the cashew butter was nice as well.our other starter was wild mushrooms poached in butter served with caramelized cauliflower puree and black bread crumbs. a simple dish but so well executed and delicious. the mushrooms were soften slightly with their wonderful earthiness intact. the real star though was the cauliflower puree  so rich and smooth. very enjoyable.our second course started with gnocchi a la fajiole served with romano beans, smoked tomatoes and parmigiana. a nice creamy sauce paired well with the pillowy gnocchi and the beans. only complaint would be the portion size  definitely would have been nice to have a few extra gnocchi!the second main was grilled octopus with a hibiscus glaze, chorizo, soy beans, black olive powder and lemon. the hit of the evening for us. the mixture of the glaze and the chorizo gave the tender octopus a hint of both sweetness and spiciness. the soy beans added a little extra sustenance to the plate. definitely a dish i would order again.for dessert, we were treated to house doughnuts with lemon mousse and huckleberry jam. the doughnuts were light and fluffy in the inside with a nice crunch on the outside. add the sugar coating to the jam and the mousse and you have a nice dessert right there. the final dessert was a brioche with a nut beurre monte, sumac and a wild flower glace au miel. just like the doughnuts, the brioche was nice and fluffy. the special touches of the beurre monte and the glace au miel provided some nice sweetness and richness.ill admit i was disappointed that no offal or offcut dishes were present in the menu option  since that is what attracted me to lili co in the first place  but in the end, that is on me for having waiting until mtl a table to finally visit lili co. the food was excellent and the atmosphere enjoyable  you can see why they needed to move into bigger digs this year. this meal simply reinforced that i will need to come back again. looking forward to visiting chef david and catherine on a more regular occasion.cheers!
cafe hipster : ambiance sympa
had to try their cold brew cocktails. i tried the titonic and wow. it was not what i expected at all but it was definitely good. it is citrusy and you can taste the tonic in it! i love the concept and will definitely be back to try more of their cocktails. definitely something unique other mtl coffee shops dont have to offer... the decor is awesome. right up my alley with the wood, brick and neon lighting. all and all the staff is friendly, drinks are good, and decor is on point. its a little far from where i live but def glad i went!cchehade
great addition to a strip of belanger that needed a little tlc. this neighborhood cafe has friendly staff, good pastries and fresh pressed drinks, and several interesting cold brew cocktails. i personally opted for the matcha latte because it was chilly out and asked for it extra hot. the long tables and cute decor are inviting  great to hang out with friends or for group study sessions. will have to go back and try the coffee.
le porc effiloche fume etait tout simplement delicieux, accompagne de sa sauce pommebiere et doignons caramelises, un delice. le prix est correcte pour la quantite 13 le trio sandwich, frites et boisson. un petit bemol concernant les frites qui aurait merite un peu de sel ou un assaisonnement original pour aller avec le porc effiloche frites de patate douce ?. nous y reviendrons pour gouter les autres sandwich :.
great sandwich! the fetard sandwich was really filling. the only thing is that i find it wise to stick to their sandwich.
jai pris le sandwich le gendarme. un sandwich au poulet frit et bacon. 8. tres bon, je le recommande. service rapide et sympatique.
cest cool, ya de la bonne bouffe, mais quand le monde qui arrive apres toi sont servie avant toi, cest plate. donc pas toptop sur le service. des efforts a faire surtout que on vient pas nous expliquer pk ca prend du temp.
came here a few weeks ago for a meeting, was very surprised to find a charming little tearoomcafe  situated on almost ghost town prince arthur! the place is set up as a largeish, but small, cosy tearoom, which opens its doors as early as 7 am, for the breakfast  just comingout of thebarclub set. the owner boasts hes the only one on the street to open that early, and stays open till midnight. the teas are very reasonably prices 2.75 per pot, slightly more for organic, and you can also purchase teas by weight, as well as coffee. the decor is homey, cosy, plants placed here and there throughout the  room, an old fashioned sofa in the back, with a small library,and large metal canisters of coffee lining the back walls. i was informed by the owner himself, that his breakfast pastries and other baked goodies are supplied by none other than godley  creme, and the cakes are baked by a vegan baker. light lunches  suppers are also served, if one wants. the place only opened a couple of months ago, and there are already a few regular tea and coffee aficianados who drop by at all hours and days. this is a great place to decompress at the end of a long day or evening, enjoy a super cup of tea or coffee, chat with the owner, who loves to chat, have a healthful light meal, or enjoy some vegan cake, and watch the world go by.
le sandwich vege avec tomates sechees et salade dans sa baguette fraiche est delicieux. et que dire du cafe! wow! il faut attendre, mais ca en vaut la peine.
i passed this book storepost office several times and kept telling myself i needed to check it out. recently i was in need of a howto watercolor painting book so i finally went in. i sat on a chair and went through 4 shelves of art books  and i found 3 that were just what i wanted. i was singing a happy tune as i paid for them at the register. the books were in almost new condition and cost under 20 for all.
new asian fusion spot now open on the east side, complete with a punny name! they have thai and chinese staple dishes for the traditionalists, and some fun specials, too. you can get any number of thaichinese dishes here, and theyre fairly solid the pan fried potstickers great dipping sauce! and crab rangoon really light on the cream cheese are made fresh daily, but my usual picks are the egg foo yung or the crispy pork with chinese broccoli. my guy often opts for the orange chicken, chow mein, or the wor won ton soup giant portion.  if youre feeling more adventurous, they offer some fusion specials. ive enjoyed the thairrito, the thai deviled eggs, and the mongolian beef hash and eggs. snag the garlic cheese fries during hh. beverages: thai tea, thai coffee, torani fruit smoothies, blended frappes, milk tea, flavored teas, and great honey boba. try the turbo frappe for an unbeatable caffeine rush.family owned and operated with attentive and friendly service. everything is made to order, so call ahead or using eat24.  small stage area in the back for performances and special events. hh specials available 11am3pm, and they give teachers, emt, police, firefighters, etc 10 off with id, all day, every day.december 2015 edit: theyve pared down the menu and are trying out a sushi tuesdays special.
good thai, probably one of the better in the area. the happy hour specials are very cool, its a great idea. will def recommend to friends and be back again sometime.
101115: just learned that happy hour is now 35pm daily, with entrees for 4.95. the former happy hour is still 113 daily, but its now the lunch special menu and has more options.considering that their music playlist consists solely of songs from the king of pop, jwoks name doesnt reference the right genre. but at least their food popped in my mouth.jwok cafe is a standalone restaurant located near sams club in one of those sprawling tropicana avenue plazas. the entrance and therefore the best parking is on the side facing reno not tropicana.  the menu is mainly composed of standard entrees, appetizers, and soups associated with thai and chinese cuisine. they also have a fusion menu, which i may explore at another time, as well as smoothies, frappes, and milk tea. with boba available for 0.75 extra, i wondered if it could be a decent substitute for dedicated tea shops. however, i decided not to overload on sugar today.socalled happy hour specials are available daily from 11 to 3, and i chose the pad thai 6 special with chicken tofu also a standard option, and other meats cost extra. it was presented in a plastic togo bowl container. it was as good as any other standard restaurant pad thai: moist noodles, an overall sweetness that you can offset with a small lime wedge, a reasonable amount of chicken some even with a bit of a char, bean sprouts, and greens. i barely remembered that i ordered it as a 3 out of a spicy scale of 10 because the heat dissipated quickly. other places are more aggressive with their capsaicin, and my sensitive palate was thankful that they went light instead. portionwise, its average for a lunch special, not small as id originally thought.i also picked up a 2 thai tea. i think the large size is also the one offered on the happy hour menu, but i know with certainty that it was advertised at that price and size on their blackboard today. its a fairly generous portion served in a plastic cup thats strongly reminiscent of a whipped cream venti frappuccino, and its sweet but not cloyingly so. i could see myself ordering it again as a happy hour or blackboard special.im not sure if this issue will persist for the rest of the vegas summer, but it was noticeably warm when i first stepped in. they have two vertical ac units that didnt seem to be very powerful, but it did get cooler as the meal proceeded, especially when i moved to a table directly facing one of the fans.while jwok is not a complete replacement for more traditional thai or chinese restaurants, it definitely hit the right notes for me. its a good neighborhood restaurant that i could see myself revisiting, although not for a very quick lunch because they took a little longer than id expected to cook the food which is a good sign otherwise. check it out if you happen to be in the area.
stopped in for some food saw it listed as hot and new on yelp. this place is tiny.  they had me at large thai iced tea! im a sucker for that stuff. their happy hour early! like 13pm.  so we missed it by 3 hours.  : honestly we ordered a lot of food and it still only came out to 41. good prices on good food. our server was a tall young man with glasses and while you have the option to order at the counter or be served.  we chose served.  i only saw two people working a young woman and him seemed both did the cooking and serving. very nice polite people. we ordered lumpia, wontons, garlic chicken with friend rice, and drunken noodles.  all very good except i would use the lumpia sauce also with the wontons. the wonton sauce tasted a bit too rich for these simple little things.  i would go back
super convenient location for those who live in juhl and those enjoying the wedding chapel across the street. otherwise, it is a little out of the way...right in between fremont and the arts district.their cocktail menu is really unique and fun  ive tried three or four of their cocktails and have loved every one! the bartenders are really friendly and helpful too.my complaint is largely the decor. it is like 80 there but something just isnt quite right. it feels a little too feminine and bright, not enough swanky sexy feel for my liking. i also am surprised they only have one bathroom. now i understand it is a small bar, but we all know sometimes someone locks themselves in a stall doing all sorts of things...getting sick, primping, etc...if that happens, well, no one else man or woman! can go to the bathroom!
this is my new spot since lady sylvia is gone , is really centric and hidden ! the environment and the attention was really nice , the only small problem i had is maybe i got the wrong drink , in my opinion was a little sour , but other than that was good .
hidden in plain sight. the classic jewel is one of those places you probably wouldnt be able to find without the yelp app. located on third and bonneville inside the juhl high rise apartments. this place has the look and vibe of old vegas, but with a lot modern touches. they specialize in giving classic cocktails that cool updated spin everything from mint julips, old fashioneds, and martinis. i tried three drinks during my visit here... the royal flush with absolut pear vodka, st. germain, pineapple juice and topped with castillo. this was served in a champagne glass and was very sweet. not really my normal cocktail choice, but this was very refreshing and great way to open up my pallet for my next cocktail. twisted old fashioned made with makers bourbon, muddled orange, cherry brandy and blood orange bitters. as a whiskey lover i really enjoy a good old fashioned drink, but this one fell just a tad short. it had an interesting bittersweet flavor that was hard for me to enjoy, maybe too much cherry brandy?brooklyn to vegas, made with bulleit bourbon, blood orange bitters, antica carpano vermouth. this was by far my favorite of the three drinks. heavy on the bourbon and the splash of vermouth gave it that herbal kick in the pants. great cocktail for the lover of bourbon based drinks. great spot to start you night out or enjoy a solid happy hour session which they offer 7 days a week from 46. cheers!
the burgers ate super yummy we had the burn your face make sure u get the sauce on the side super hot the dr pepper burger was amazing and the salty crunchy pickles we super yummy too
since simon is gone cafe 6 quickly replaced it. cafe 6 looks like the same decor and only a change of menu. they have a cute menu with burgers, sammiches, fries, salads, and even some dessert which they call love handles. i decided to grab a couple different items and try everything i could with some coworkers. we orders the upick burger trio. first was burn your face off, second was the turkey snack, and last was the belly wash. the burn your face off was hot and tasty. the turkey looked funny with the taro bun, which is blueish purple, but was very tasty. the apple cranberry dressing was good. lastly the belly wash was my favorite. beef and bbq sauce, what more can you ask for. we also order the blta stack. a blt with avocado, total winner. it also came with a side of fries, we go the waffles fries. it also comes with their house made ketchup. super yummy. last but not least we ordered some wangs. we decided to get the sauce on the side. we decided to try the sweet thai chili. they were very good. we could have just got them on there. it was a filling delicious meal. im really excited to try more items. for sure going to get the blta again, and maybe a side of wangs.
cafe 6 is the new cafe inside of the palms place casino. it replaces the simon restaurant that was there for a long time. i wanted to check out what was different, and what was the same. there are some similarities, plus some differences, so i will go into detail.this restaurant is located on the 6th floor of the palms place. there is self parking and valet options all around, so just take the elevator to the 6th floor when you come inside of palms place. after walking through to the restaurant, i was immediately sat by the hostess, given my menu, and my server came by shortly and asked about my drink order. looking around the restaurant, i noticed that they didnt do a major overhaul of the dining room, which is a good thing because the dining room does look elegant and comfortable, with great views of the pool and people watching.while perusing the menu, i noticed that the humorously whimsical kerry simon menu has been replaced by a simpler, more straightforward one, with a focus on being more casual and approachable. there is a wide variety of crowd pleasing favorites such as burgers, salads, sandwiches, as well as appetizers including chicken wings, and pretzels. i came in during lunch time, and during that time i was handed a drink menu that was full of standard beers, but also had a large selection of craft ones. i chose an ipa called le freak by a brewery in california called green flash. it was a hoppy beer that complimented my meal very well. the server took my food order and i waited for my food.there seemed to be a mixup in the ordering when my food arrived. i had ordered a couple appetizers and a burger meal. the burger came out first, rather than the appetizers. i didnt really mind since im not crazy anal like that, but my preference would be the other way around on most occasions.   so first, the burger. i ordered the land and sea. the burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare, just as i had requested. it was also seasoned well, and was hot and juicy. i could tell that they are using quality beef for their burgers. the crab dynamite was fresh. the condiments were subtle and very fresh, and the bun was toasted nicely, and held its shape very well. there is a choice of fries that comes with all the burgers, and i chose the waffle fries. they were hot and crispy, and seasoned well.next were my appetizers. i ordered the chicken wings and beer battered rock shrimp. first, the wings. they used the big sized ones, which i appreciated. they were good wings, and sauced well. as for the rock shrimp, the batter was light and crispy, and the rock shrimp were fresh and of good quality. heres a tip, eat the shrimp together with the celery, youre welcome.my server was really good, she asked if i was doing well and if the food was good, which it was. i thought they had priced their menu extremely well, taking into consideration that this is a casino restaurant.suffice to say, i was really pleased with my meal, and would come back again. this is a spot thats making very solid food, with good quality product. the service is good and i enjoyed myself here.
disclaimer my family and i were invited by the palms to experience their new cafe 6 in palms place.  this review is based off of our overall experience of food  service.  upon arriving, we waited for several minutes by the host counter.  no one was present im guessing because an actual host wasnt there that day.  we were seated by one of the waitresses who saw us and another party near the counter.cafe 6 is hardly reminiscent of an everyday cafediner you might think of.  this was formerly a kerry simon joint, and its possible some of the decor remained intact for this new place.  its very inviting, with the fireplace, the hard woods, the serene colors, the bamboo, and of course, the pool right outside the glass doors.  cafe 6 must be popular for the lunch lounge crowd, order from the restaurant and get served by the pool.  by night time, the pool was closed and no one was around.  cafe 6 itself wasnt overly busy for a friday night, but there was a decent crowd throughout.our server stacy was very on point.  cordial, pleasant, upbeat, and courteous.  we also met restaurant manager michelle who was equally nice and warm, attentive to anything we would need for the evening.   started off with the bottle libations menu and ordered an ace pineapple cider by the ca cider company.  it came out before our meal so stacy was kind enough to put it back on ice until our food arrived.  service!  we dined on:baked hard  salted soft pretzel 9.95  this sucker was huge!  pizza sized fresh made pretzel with a side of cheese sauce  dijon mustard for dipping.deliciousness!  really was one of my fav things of the meal.  hard on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside.  devoured.salty crunchy pickles 6.95  fried pickles with sriracha mayo, bbq sauce  lemonherb aioli for dipping.  these were good as well.  i liked how they came in spear form.  coated just right and fried, nice blend of sour  savory with good crunch.dr. peppershroom 15.95  angus burger with roasted portabella, white cheddar, caramelized onions, dijon  dr. pepper glaze on a brioche bun.  my little one got this.  she liked it very much!  burger was big, juicy, with good flavor coming from the portabella.  it was light on the dr. pepper taste though.  waffle fries on the side were also a highlight for her, hot  crisp with good seasoning.upick trio 13.95  pick 3 mini angus burgers off of the menu.  wifey chose:  1. toadstool swiss: roasted portabella, caramelized onions, swiss cheese, lettuce, dijon  ketchup on brioche bun. 2. bacon bleu: applewood smoked bacon, blue cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion  ketchup on brioche bun. 3. belly wash: pork belly, coleslaw, skinny fries  bbq sauce on brioche bun.fancy!  nice presentation on a wood paddle.  wifey liked the mini burgers very much, each flavorful even on little buns.  the belly wash was a standout, pork belly added an unctuous bite.  if you order the mini burgers be aware, they do not come with a side of fries or onion rings.  blta stack 10.95  bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado  house sauce on sourdough baguette.with the apps we ordered i went light on my main.  the blta sounded yummy, and im a club sandwich type of guy.  cafe 6 wasnt kidding, this sandwich is stacked!  comes out to your table on one of those menu order pins, each quarter stacked on top the other.  neat!  the sandwich itself was tasty though.  bacon was crunchy, lettuce  tomato were crisp, and the avocado was fresh.  house sauce was akin to a 1000island.  but the kicker were the onion rings!  a massive side came with my sandwich.  they were great, battered just right and fried to golden brown delicious.  perfect with their housemade ketchup.  careful, the ketchup does have a kick!even with the leftovers we were packing up to take home, manager michelle asked us to try one of their desserts.  we chose:ice cream burger 11.95  chocolate ice cream patty on wafer bun, with funnel cake fries, creme anglaise  raspberry saucethis was so funky!  throws you off your taste buds!  you see burger but taste dessert!  wifey wasnt really into the concept of this, but the little one  i were totally on board!  it is a novelty of sorts, but so fun to eat!  its like a klondike bar in a bun.  funnel cake fries were good too, light  sweet, good for dipping in the raspberry sauce.overall we had a great time at cafe 6.  i would come back for the giant pretzel itself, and kick back with that and a beer or two.  then probably order a burger to share.  i like the concept they have got going here, its casual fare but punched up a notch.  i will say though cafe 6 is not cheap eats!  burgers average around the 1516 mark, around strip pricing.  but there is quality there and lots of potential.  service for us was a big plus.thank you cafe 6 and the staff of the palms for a great meal and hospitality.  keep up the good work!
experience:  came to check out this new spot with a friend. it was 6:00 on a sat evening. facility:  this is a beautiful place. it does have an upscale feel, but then the view of the pool makes it feel casual. we sat at the round half bench tables that had 2 chairs at the end. they also have a full bar for beer and cocktails. service:  the staff were super friendly. our waiter, anthony, was very friendly and continuously concerned for our satisfaction. even the manager jumped in at one point to check on our happiness and corrected a small problem by offering us a complimentary dessert. 5 star service here!!!food: my friend and i decided to to the fried pickle appetizer, since you folks on yelp raved about it. if you like fried pickles, these were yummy! we shared a burger each, but split them so we could each taste two. we also got fries and onion rings to share, so we got a good taste of the menu. crunchy, salty pickles  45  they came with 3 sauces lemon aioli, sriracha mayo, and bbq sauce. i loved the sriracha mayo the most. they are spears, not chips, for those wondering. oh yeah, speaking of chips...i loved the surprise of salt and vinegar chips on the bottom of the pickles. they might have been there to soak up grease, but i love them too much to not partake. burn your face off burger  45  the waiter suggested we get the habanero hot sauce on the side, so we listened. this burger was good, and the hot sauce was indeed very hot. i loved it!!!  but on the side was a great suggestion. it was a tad overdone, but cheeses with good flavors from the poblanos and cole slaw. waffle fries  55  crisp, delicious and exactly what youd expect from a good fry!smoke out burger  45  at the suggestion of the waiter, we tried this burger and so glad we did!  i loved the flavors on this burger.  i liked the pretzel bun much better than the torta bun too. it was a tad overdone and the bbq sauce a tad sweet for my palate, but it was a pretty good balance for the rich meats. the brisket was so good, i wish i had some separately on my plate. you gotta try this burger!!!onion rings  55  these were the big fat beer battered onion rings that are big enough to replace the patty on your burger. could only eat one because they were so big!  fried cookie cutter  i am not going to rate this one, because its unfair that im not a dessert person, nor do i like chocolate; however, my friend said it was 65!  it looked very good...the fried oreos. reminded me of fair food back in louisiana. i did sneak a small taste of the vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce and that was yum!  overall:  i really liked this place. loved the ambience...loved the service...and the food was good. i cant give it a 5, since our burgers were overdone, but they were both flavorful. dont come here when your on a diet...come here when you are ready to splurge on flavorful, yummy food with a topping of great service. :
i loved the decor and poolside setting when this spot was simons, but service was terrible. glad to see that cafe 6 has tasty burgers and a total turnaround in the service department but the cuisine doesnt really fit the spalike locale. that said, id still keep this spot in mind for a great burger.fried pickles: these are spears instead of the expected chips, perfectly crisp and served with a trio of dipping sauces an acidic ranch, a sweet bbq, and a spicy sriracha. interesting presentation features vinegar chips under the pickles? the wedgie: more like a wedge salad mated with a blta sandwich, minus the bread. presentation deconstructed the wedge to more manageable pieces,  with generous amounts of avocado and bleu cheese, two slices of bacon. one of the few freshhealthy options, lots of textural contrast, would get again.mini burgersturkey snack: turkey burger with lettuce, avocado, swiss, and applecranberry marmalade on a taro bun. the purple taro bun is fun and slightly sweet, tastes like a hawaiian roll. this is a great turkey burger, surprisingly juicy.bacon bleu: angus patty with bacon allegedly, didnt detect any on ours?, bleu cheese sauce, lto, on brioche bun. lovely buttery bun and an incredibly strong sauce, burger was juicy, a bite of perfection.toadstool swiss: angus patty with roasted portabella, caramelized onion, lettuce, swiss, dijon mustard, housemade ketchup. the burger id most anticipated was underwhelming. portabella lacked flavor, mustard didnt really harmonize with other ingredients, small chopped onions were falling all over the plate and didnt stay on the burger.fullsize burgerdr. pepper shroom burger: huge, thick angus patty with roasted portabella, white cheddar, caramelized onion, dr. pepper glaze, dijon mustard on brioche bun. the full sized burgers are gigantic! aside from our cooking issues below, the sweet dr. pepper glaze worked better than expected and added to the mushrooms savory meatiness. really enjoyed the flavors of this burger. waffle fries: these are perfectly crisp and wonderfully seasoned, served with a spicy ketchup with a lot of kick. i ate way too many of these, enjoying them more than any other version in recent memory.nutella donuts: puffy donut holes, dusted in cinnamonsugar and served with a trio of sauces the creme anglaise being my favorite. nutella filling was a good amount, not overflowing, happy my bf pushed to order these despite my not being a dessert fan.  i recommend the trio of sliders 14, which allows you to try more burger styles, though the giant patty of the fullsize burger is a good value. the sliders were cooked perfectly, whereas our fullsized burger was served first overcooked to well done then redone to practically rare. if youre charging 15burger, every one should be cooked perfectly an area to improve upon.service was fairly good: lots of positive staff around to check up on us, they had no problem remaking our burger or upselling drinks, apps, and desserts. now if only they could get people in the door! despite a friday evening datenight, there were few diners here and they were mostly older groups. location away from the casino floor plus 15 burgers pricey for some doesnt really help. hoping this place lasts as a concept as i want to return for the bbq brisket burger! , but it doesnt really fit the location.
resting above the valley on the 6th floor of the palms place down at the farthest reaches of the seemingly endless sky tube, cafe 6 is a lonely place.  my friend and i went one tuesday evening a couple of weeks ago.  i was shocked to see the restaurant completely empty.  there wasnt even a hostess.  just a sign inviting us to seat ourselves.  why did i even make a reservation?  it seems it was all in vain.besides being completely devoid of customers, aside from my friend and myself, this restaurant has space that is being horribly under utilized. from what i understand, there used to be another establishment here. one that offered a greater variety. as for cafe 6, it is a faux high end place selling gourmet pub fare at gourmet prices. this space is not suited for such a menu. a nice, albeit secluded, location with a beautiful crystal clear pool just on the other side of a thin pane of glass does not deserve waffle fries and overloaded messy burgers which are served in an undersized basket that does nothing to keep the tables clean.it is these very burgers that i am a fan of at cafe 6.  i eat a lot of burgers and the one i had here was one of the best in three consecutive days of a burger binge.  i ordered the dr. pepper shroom burger.  the pattie was thick and fresh and cooked to a perfect medium.  the portabello pieces were in absolutely every bite and some even fell out into the basket below where they waited patiently for me to rescue them.  the cheese was gooey and oh so good.  i could have done without the dijon mustard but that is just a taste preference rather than a criticism of what cafe 6 has created.  and the waffle fries on the side were the perfect vehicle to break up the richness of the burger.  they were served with a house made spicy ketchup.  it was not unlike a cocktail sauce though it was a different spice than from horseradish.  i enjoyed it so thoroughly i asked for more.what is a onceinablue moon dinner without dessert?  i ordered the banana split on this night which was coincidentaly a few days after a blue moon.  vanilla, strawberry and chocolate ice creams were hidden beneath heaps of whipped cream, wafer sticks, chocolate swizzles and a cherry.  on the sides were two halves of a banana that had been coated with sugar and bruleed to caramelize them into a crispy sweet treat.  i was reminded of bananas foster without the booze tear.  eating this pushed me over the edge and i decided it was time to call it a night.i want to like cafe 6 but i just dont know if it is going to last.  if a tuesday evening between 6:00 and 8:00 is any indication, they likely wont make it too long.  i hope im wrong because the staff is friendly and the food is amazing.  they dont deserve to be tossed aside and overlooked.
my pals and i were staying at the palms, but on the ...other side of the resort.  the side with 36 burger restaurants.  we passed on those, and had gone to nearby izakaya cocokala a couple nights in a row.  however, we wanted to change it up and heard from some pals who had dined at cafe 6 the previous night that we would like it.i built my own burger and ordered a bunless they call it topless veggie burger topped with pepper jack and a roasted  poblano pepper.  i was pleased when the veggie burger ended up being a roasted corn and black bean number and was transported to a very messy get the bun, yo but tasty mexiinspired heaven.  but considering they have fish burgers, chicken burgers, and more, there is undoubtedly no end to the delish you could inspire for yourself.and my boo got the fried chicken that was enticing enough for me to sampleeven though i avoid eating the land animals these days.  it was ridic.fries were just whatever, but served in cutesy deep fryer baskets that i appreciated.i would go back in a heartbeat and scope out their beer menu.  i was too tired to browse when i visited.
excellent service by anthony.last visit  same set up as simons.kids especially like the gigantic pretzel and desserts. burgers ok.
ive been to this restaurant before when it was called simons. now its a casual burger place. its located on the 6th floor of palms place with a view of the pool. thanks to antonia rs yelp review so we decided to give it a try.came in for a quick lunch and the bartender  server seated us by the window with the pool view. it wasnt busy but didnt care cause was just really looking forward to the burgers base on yelp reviews.i ordered the burn your face off burger because im a big fan of anything spicy. this medium angus beef topped w jalapenos, roasted poblano, pepper jack cheese  slaw on torta bun was the one i was dared to try. omg...i forgot about the habenero sauce and boy...this burger numbed my lips, tongue  cheeks. i was sweating bite after bite but it was worth it :  the other patrons and our server had a good a laugh at my expense so it was all good!  at least i sweated all the alcohol from the night before.gotta check this place out. burger was juicy, friendly service and affordable menu!
this place was east side marios before. theyve got over 30 beers on tap or bottled, the food has improved significantly since its reincarnation. thursdays is ladys night with a dj. worth checking out for those in vsl, laval and the west island.
dr. lalani is the absolute best. i see him. i have a family history of thyroid issues including cancer. after i got a routine blood work results from my primary doctor that indicated hypothyroidism i knew this is where i needed to go. i drive here every week over an hour each way simply to see the best of the best!!dr. lalani is incredibly knowledgable. he caught my aunts thyroid cancer before it because a serious issue. his knowledge of thyroid and endocrine disorders has top notch staff that help you along the way. he is on top of everything with routine bloodwork to check your status, and response to treatment. i do believe you require an appointment because the wait can sometimes be long but its worth it! plus i was warned about the wait time on my first appointment when i met with dr. lalani oneonone to discuss possible treatment plan options. unlike other providers i was not rushed when we spoke.the dr actually takes time for you and thats why there is sometimes a bit of a wait. but if you want to see the best for endocrinethyroid then you go to dr. lalani!!plus they warn you about how long your appt can be so i find the other review regarding the long wait. so if you want to see the best then i gotta wait sometimes.the only issue i have had thus far is their billing department as well as the lab attached to the office actually threw out my blood instead of testing my vitamin d levels like the doctor had ordered. majorly dropped the ball and entirely frustrating.bottom line... if you want to get the best doctor with the most knowledge then you go to lalani.
convenient location in sprouts shopping center on southeast corner scottsdale road and pinnacle peak.  new, clean, fast, and very friendly staff.  enjoy it before word gets out and its too busy or has bad service like the shea  90th location.
ok the linq hotel sucks but the spa was a very lovely surprise. well thought out. very comfortable. lovely showers. nice massagetreatment rooms. service people were very friendly. i would visit again!!the fitness center is nice!
this spa was a really nice surprise. we had a disappointing stay at the hotel, but the customer service and quality of the massage for me and facial for my wife was outstanding. you are assigned an personal attendant when you walk in who shows you around and makes you comfortable. the facility is very relaxing and clean. its also a bargain compared to some of the other spas at vegas strip hotels. i highly recommend it!
ive had 2 wonderful meals at les filettes. the first was a saturday night and we went there after the reviews came out in the gazette. we were told the terasse was full but after 5 minutes they gave us a table outside. we found the prices very reasonable and i loved the food. first the butter! it casts a couple of dollars but it was amazing hazelnut and sea salt i think. i had the liver which was cooked perfectly and my husband had the salmon which had a wonderfully crisp skin and the corn sauce was amazing. a friend had the pasta and was underwhelmed but why eat italian food at a french restaurant?!the second time was for a ladies lunch! and again, great service and my food was delicious. 3 courses for 21 and that included hangar steak. other dishes were even cheaper.were not big wine drinkers but service was excellent, very friendly and they werent upset that we werent drinking much. im looking forward to going back
i came with a party of 10 for a birthday. the menu was a bit confusing but we figured it out and only once we had decided what we all wanted to order individually, the waiter offered their set sharing menu. we wouldve clearly liked to choose this option but it was a little late. the service was very mediocre not refilling the water, slow response, repeating ourselves, no ice for the white wine we ordered, etc.  an overall chill attitude from the staff but maybe thats what theyre trying for? id say take away the white tablecloths and lower the prices in that case... anyway. long story short, the food was good and thats where the 4 stars come in. the brussel sprout entree and the mackerel entree were fantastic, layered with flavour. the smoked sturgeon main was strange and salty. the osso bucco was huge and good. the desserts were delicious too. the price is reasonable and i like how each dish is different in size, cute.
opened mid may 2015. as always chipotle doesnt disappoint. friendly staff and clean new restaurant. plenty of parking.
ive personally invested in chipotle stock and this location is decent at best. awesome staff but judging the other reviews, theyre right for the most part. meat is typically oldlooking and tasting andor running out quite often. parking is asexpected due to it being in a small complex. it can be either slow or packed but lately during lunch its seemed packed. nonetheless, when i crave chipotle due to my work location i come here opposed to up the block.
our company was referred to allied print  design in 2014, and weve been very happy with the services theyve provided. patrick has been excellent at meeting our needs and providing the level of customer service that we expect. we came to him with major business card revisions that had already been attempted by 2 other companies, and his graphics skills enabled him to be on target in finalizing our cards to exactly what we wanted.  he has done an awesome job at other print projects weve thrown at him as well!  highly recommend allied print  design!!
ive been about 5 times now. service is pretty good, maybe only once i wasnt impressed. drinks are interesting, but my best ones have been ones not listed on the menu. ive sat in a variety of places, all seats are good seats. place gets really busy on the weekends. i want to try their brunch still have heard good things. good wise ive only tried the cheese boards which were excellent. love the decor. opening weekend met one of the owners and he was very nice. sundays dj flash spins old school stuff. the sangria and punch bowls are fun but not worth the 40 price tag. good for a date night or girls night. larger groups are hard to accommodate.
its a small causal bar in uptown waterloo. i like the atmosphere. we ordered mussels all you can eat for 20 and the steak. the mussels are good. i like the bloody caesar one more than the miso. i find the miso broth too salty and doesnt really taste like miso. for drinks, we ordered the rabbit greyhound. nothing special. my friend came here a couple times and mentioned that the cheesemeat boards are really good.
dropped in for first time on a sunday night. great atmosphere, superfriendly staff and open til 2am every night. sunday nights are hiphop night with a dj spinning...never would have expected it, wish i had come in sooner. just a great experience overall in uptown waterloo.
a friend and i went in to look for my first ever furniture purchase, a new mattress set. the staff who helped us was laid back and yet very knowledgeable. she was patient with us trying different beds and carefully answered and asked questions about my sleep patterns. overall i ended up picking a great bed for a great discounted price. delivery took longer than i expected but it was over a holiday weekend. i would shop here again. also there was a platter of free girl scout cookies at the door. nice touch!
traffic jam on the highway led us into mt. holly around lunchtime, and we smelled this place before we saw it  mmmmmm... the smell of roasting chicken!  so we decided to pop on by.i ordered some grilled chicken with fries, barbecue sauce on the side, and it was tasty.  the chicken was hot and juicy and tender  cooked perfectly.  the dish came with a bed of fries and cole slaw, which they let me substitute for maccheese for free!  the maccheese was just ok but again, served at a good temperature, and the crinkly fries also hit the spot.  it was just a perfect, filling lunch for a good price.you order at the front counter and then they bring the food to your table.  service is very fast.  i found the booths to be quite comfortable and the bathrooms clean.this was a solid, delicious meal for a roadtrip and i am almost glad about the traffic jam because otherwise we would have missed this place!
after viewing a movie here today, i felt the need to leave this review and heres why:first off, i suggest everyone to join their rewards program for free! im not an avid movie goer but when i do watch a movie, id love to get something back of course. today, i earned a free popcorn just for watching 2 movies in the past few months and we all know how expensive their food is. lolsecond and probably most importantly, they have recently been searching bags before movie goers could go in to the theater. im usually one to bring food in and would be offended if people searched my purse but i respect this new policy. after several theater shootings around the country, they are simply concerned about the safety of their patrons. if youre not hiding anything then whats the big deal right? today, a male worker asked for my bag to be opened so i opened my purse with no hesitation and he used a flashlight to look in for a few seconds. im sure he saw my tampons, random receipts and other things but i didnt mind. also, while viewing the movie, a worker came in 4 times just to walk around the theater and make sure everything was good. i felt safe today and it was awesome. im sure others may feel otherwise and think these new policies are too much but better safe than sorry. one more thing too: their prices are much higher for the movies, so just a heads up. if youre not down to be searched or pay higher, theres suncoast casino a few miles away and i suggest you take your business there instead.
i like this theatre, its big and normally pretty empty. my mom has a regal rewards card so we had a free movie ticket on hand that we got the last time we went to a regal theatre. we came here to watch bridge of spys. i got myself a soda and we found some seats right in the middle. the seats here are kinda weird though. im small and light and the legs kept on going up for me, i kept on rocking back and forth trying to keep my legs down. once i leaned back though it settled. the screen here is huge and there are three main sections of seats. for it being such a big theatre the place is mostly empty and pretty quite. a nice and peaceful movie theatre, a great way to kill some time.
i was shocked when i checked in on yelp, that this was the first time! i have been here so many times!!!but this was the first time going to the imax.although not the biggest or best imax i have been to, it was pretty darn great! the sound system vibrated the seats! yes!!! so much fun! i will seriously consider the imax screen for new blockbuster movies!as for regular movies, it is perfect. never really crowded, easy to get in and out from. and the bonus is there is a good food court right outside of the theater, or any one of the other fantastic red rock restaurants right there too!a few insider tips....tickets are reduced all day on tuesday! only 6 for a regular movie!!they also give discounts for aarp members, seniors and i think vetsif you are driving, the self parking lot closest to 215 is the answer. go to the back corner, there is an elevator that zips right down to the bowling alley, and you do not need to walk through the smokey casino!
well, its a movie theatre. it honestly looks like every other regal theatre. i suppose it feels a little newer and cleaner. some of the theaters are quite large and can hold a huge crowd. the bathrooms werent a mess. the staff were nice. the concessions staff were quick. im not sure theres much else you can ask for in a movie theatre. in sum, this is a nice one and a worthy place to see a film.
wolf and water has stepped in bond no 9s shoes, and does a good job at filling them! the barrestaurant is quite large, with different seating areas. the vibe is quite industrial with some scandinavian design touches. clear plastic chairs and fluffy sheepskins, i like it! if the weather is nice you can sit outside in the sun, by the water.the bar has a wide selection of drinks, including cocktail slushies and normal cocktails in a tin can. not bad! the food selection looked great, and i had the pulled pork cheese chips  a really nice combination and a big portion for a side! the prices for food were ok, the prices for alcohol a little on the steep side cheapest pint £4.the personnel is new as you can imagine for a new bar but experienced bar tenders, and they are nice, always a plus! a dj arrived later in the evening which i find gives this place a little bit of an edge over its competitors in leith  good music! wolf and water is stepping up the bar game, and delivers! its definitely more upmarket than its neighbours, the prices are higher  but you are getting a lot back for it. i will be back!
i havent heard of this until we received an invite to celebrate a friends engagement.but hey anythings worth a first shot in life.landmark: its next door to the kichen  just so we dont go off track and fall into the canal  yes stay away from the water!space  there is lots of it.  both inside and out and lots of seats to park your arse on.  there is a private room that you can here too and that way you keep an eye on your guestsfriendsmates or that relative!  mind you the private room is like a glasshouse  we need ventilation in here.food  they do food, but havent tried it myself.  please see other reviews from the yelp familia!drink  i had this lovely sav. blanc x4 large glasses and it went down very well.  i did see a variety of cool cocktails and was considering ordering one but couldnt decide!  yeah, id come back and explore the drinks menu and try a burger to make my mind up fully about this place!
they sell everything you need for gifting, living and aboding.  this store has designer clothes, fragrances, unique snacks and seasonings, and inspiration pieces for outdoor and inside.  just noticed as pointed out by my nephews they even have a toy section.  there is every reason to look here if youre looking to finish off a room or an outfit.  there is something for every member of the family and anyone youre looking to get something for.  the prices vary per group item type.  clothing is priced great!  fragrances are priced even better.  home decor is rather good, but their furniture is a little on the pricey side.  having said that: this store is messy and cluttered, but the staff is friendly, helpful and abundant.
sweet! i always love the tj, home goods combo stores! this location is huge! i need at least an hour to browse everything. tons of clearance! i like that there are registerscheck outs at both the parking lot side and the mall entrance side. the toy clearance looked like a bomb went off but every other section was pretty neat and easy to shop. if you find the same clearance item with a lower price, they will let you have both for the lower of the two! thats the way to do business!!
great people, great prices.very caring.  my little chipom mix ran into skin issues with the soap they used.  the owner gave me a hypoallergenic soap to use and suggested gold bond medicated powder to help with the itch.  i used both, plus spray from the vet for his scratches.  took a while, but he came thru it.
if you are looking for zen relaxation, this probably isnt the place for you. if you are looking to get every knot and last bit of tension worked out of you in an hour, this is your place. peter was professional and an expert in reflexology. i came in super sore from a long hard week of working out and he worked me over. i left feeling energetic and ready to hit it hard at the gym next week. i will definitely be back!
finally, this place has opened up. i didnt realize it had opened up already so i was pleasantly surprised when i was getting some froyo and saw people inside.  plus it was taco tuesday so even better. chicken and asada were good, al pastor was amazing. my son had the quesadilla which you cant really go wrong with, at least to a finicky 3 year old. my only thumbs down is th at there are no juice or milk selections for the kids menu. have to go with fountain drink options which im not a fan of. however, i will say i was way impressed when the girl managing for the guys in the back to make him some fresh pineapple juice. amazing service for them to even think of doing that for us. i would prob also like it if you had the option to get rice and or beans instead of chips with the kids meal. bottom line is, food is delicious, quirks are expected when a place just opens up so i wont harsh ice tea machine not working. cant wait to be back for some yummy fish tacos
i really enjoyed my shrimp bowlrito! the flavors mix well together and the portions are generous. there is a good variety of options on the menu including basic options tacos, burritos, quesidillas, etc.. the menu also has some unique items such as nachos that use fries instead of chips. there are also a variety of toppings to choose from! the only thing that i didnt like was finding a lot of avocado skin into guacamole. a great lunch spot!
seriously the best carne asada i have eaten in years! tender juicy grilled flavor everything you could ask for in carne asada! the al pastor is simply delicious. great food great prices i would have given them five stars but their line and kitchen staff is a little disorganized but dont worry thats not enough to stop me from getting such great food!
love the chronic tacos...delicious fresh food, friendly staff  manager! great value of your looking for a new place for a quick bite. was a little difficult to order food throughover the glass barrier especially for kids.
second visit to this place. much better service and food this time around. had the chicken tacos and got full. the place was not busy so we got our food pretty fast. recommended for your taco cravings.
really good.  better than chipotle.  im not a huge fan of chain tacoburrito places, but the portions are right for the price, the atmosphere is fun, and the food is pretty good.  el pastor wasnt amazing, but it was good and the large size burrito is more than filling.
the food is great here particularly the pork carnita tacos. the taste is oh so good. i had noticed they were real skimpy on the meat our last visit. the man in front of me obviously it was his 1st time there. wasnt too sure what was what and staff was not very helpful or friendly. the girl helping us was in training she also didnt know much about the menu. his burrito was unbelievable small almost all rice. they had to throw stuff away because they didnt quit explain the pico was the only form of tomatoes they had. the cashier should have probably been helping out the line which was backed up. ran out of green sauce it was 2:30 in the afternoon on a friday... were they making more? i say work on your customer service more, clean up the tables so people can sit and eat. ive been there 3 times 3 fridays in a row same kid is on break every time while tables are not wiped down for customers. like i said i love the food i just hope the service gets better.
breakfast burrito for lunch.. yum! the service was great and the food was good! not greasy and so much better than the other mexican grills around here. id go back again, no complaints from me!
i am happy that chronic tacos has made its way to az. i am used to seeing this establishment in cali, and i am a fan simply because they get that a lot of people prefer all white meat chicken. the nearby competitor has not gotten that message. my suggestions would be to make sure that the meat it always warm and to add another person into the serving rotation. it was a bit slow for the after 1pm lunch hour. i think they give you a lot of meat even for taco tuesday. i will definitely be back!
my bf, his dad and i come here every tuesday for tacos. great value and friendly service. our main critique consistency. there have been a couple times where i was ecstatic. the food was fresh, delicious and portions were perfect... then there are times where the meat is tough, flavorless or they totally skimp on portion sizes.over all, we are pleased and will continue our tradition here.
the line was crazy long but it was worth the wait. the subs were delicious. we split an italian and the club supreme. the tables and chairs had food on them but they were so busy they probably didnt have anyone available to keep the dining room clean. considering the craziness its forgivable. they have mug root beer yay! but no black olives...ah man. however the bread is really good, nice and soft and the meat is cut fresh. all the veggies were bright and fresh too and they have kettle chips! score! all in all this place beats out subway any day and firehouses rich sauces limit my visits so well definitely be back to jeresy mikes.
good subs, a little pricey. place had a line during lunchtime. they must be doing something right.
i got a meat ball sub and it was really good. i think the bread could be a little better but the sub was over all good and the service was prompt
we have passed by this place over the last few weeks and have been wanting to try it. jeannie and i pulled the trigger for a friday happy hour and glad we did.  great service and good food.  sampled the carne asada nachos, chips and salsa, wings, and several margaritas!   the wings were super good! enjoyed all our food and the house margaritas are served up perfectly.  this will probably become our go to happy hour place in the area.  prices are right  and the renee has the staff really focused on customer satisfaction.  thinking this will be a good place to watch football or any sporting event.  the tvs are set up well enough for it and all day happy hour on sunday.  get in here and see for yourself!
once again my wife and i were too pooped to cook.  dropped in once more to our favorite watering hole and enjoyed a fine meal.  i had a green chili pork burrito and she had the carne asada fajita.  both were tasty.  we felt pampered and welcome  the made to order michilada hit the spot. we will continue to come back.
first and probably the most important thing at this restaurant, is the perfect margaritas, authentically made and one of the best in town.  the food is a mixed bag, the best item are their tortillas, large and delicious, followed by the chips and salsa where you will want to order more of, however, the chicken street tacos were salt bombs that i would not eat again.  fish tacos are made with talapia, order the fish fried, the baked version is terrible.  the beans and rice are outstanding, and with the great tortillas you can not go wrong with any burro.  the cheese crisp was good, considering the prices here it is hard to complain about anything.  the bar is beautiful, with perfectly placed televisions inviting you back to watch your favorite game.  if there is a weakness here, it is the service which seemed out of sorts.  luckily, cory was bartending and able to jump in to make things work, while it was clear that the clueless staff must have been owners or family members by their complete lack of interest in their customers. we are going back for sure, this is the perfect casual hangout and the overall experience was very good. hope they get the service issue resolved, it will ruin their business if not.
fundido style! ok we had a little bit of most dishes, including the sampler to see which items they do best at hals. the answer? everything was so tasty! we will just have to get the sampler i suppose. totally decent margarita. and chimichanga fundido style is ridiculously good. i dont recommend the seafood one though enjoy, i know we do.
i would say this was a pretty good experience. the food was tasty and the ambiance was great. i felt like i was back home. they are still new so i think they can improve a few things but i highly suggest trying them for yourself.
i liked the menu, plenty of options. i hadnt tried new mexico cuisine, but i really liked it, a lot of roasted chili flavors. great tortillas! no alcohol  they are probably waiting on the liquor license.
finally a good mexican restaurant in summerlin!  so happy that they didnt try and do what all the other failed mexican restaurants did around here by trying to be fancy with their weird dishes and offerings.  the blue corn chicken enchiladas with green sauce is spot on caliente...great stuff!  knew this place was gonna be good as soon as i dug into the salsa. the refried beans and the arroz is perfectly seasoned. ordered tacos a la carte...disappointed with chef using premade taco shells...c mon man!  the fillings and salsa were yummy, so saved it...make the shells by hand...customers will appreciate it more.  going back for lunch this week!
this is a very unique restaurant and something i wasnt used to. when i think of mexican food i think of robertos or don tortaco. i didnt think id be too crazy about this place but it was surprisingly really good. i got the stacked carne asada enchilada and it was delicious! at first i thought i wasnt going to enjoy it because of how unexpectedly spicy it was for me but after i added a bunch of sour cream i was able to eat it no problem and it was so good! i didnt think i would finish it all but i did. i also loved the free fried ice cream my family and i got because of the special offer when you check in on yelp. will definetly be coming back! :
have been here once.  tastefully decorated.  service was excellent; our water glass was never empty and server was friendly and helpful.  salsa was good with a little heat.  enchiladas were topped with a fried egg, and tasty.  sopaipillas were served with the meal and very good.my only complaint was that food was not served very hot, but somewhat lukewarm.  we will return.  i would like to try the fried ice cream!
food was great! started out with fresh guacamole needed a little salt but once i added from the table it was perfect. i had the chile rellano with green chile and hubby had chicken tamales stacked with green chile both very good, good portion size. only downside  service was slow. not because they were inept but because they were so busy and hadnt expected the huge increase in business.  i am sure they will hire more staff because i dont see them slowing down.
tough for me to give 5 stars but this was close. carne adovado is fantastic. it is one of those once you try you compare everything else to it. it is like new mexican food in vegas!!!!
food was excellent here.  about 10 minutes from the strip in the suburbs of vegas.  very tasty.
great new mexican food! the green chile stew and the chili con queso were delicious. my husband had the beef burrito and really enjoyed it. the only thing i was not a big fan of was their salsa, but i can over look that because the food was so good. ill definitely be going back for seconds, thirds, etc.!
the restaurant has a nice atmosphere with a southwestern decor. our server amy promptly greeted us and showed us to a comfortable table. she followed up several times to ensure all was well. the carne adovada was a large portion with nice red sauce flavor and the right amount of heat for my taste. the pork was so tender that the pieces of meat fell apart with the touch of the fork. the entree includes a flour tortilla a choice of refried or pinto beans, spanish rice and calabacitas which is a mix of zucchini, corn, tomatoes, bell peppers, and onions. on the side were two sopaipillas.the menu has many choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner. definitely requires a return visit.
i love spicy food and was told about this place from a friend.  we pulled up around 7:30 on a friday evening and it wasnt busy at all. so i was a bit skeptical. im not going to lie i really thought it was going to be a gringo spot. service was great along with the decor. the waiter helped with recommendations and the menu. i was pleased with the portion to value and the side choices i actually didnt have to get refried beans i dont eat.i was very surprised the chile verde was actually hot. it was a pleasant hot i could taste my food but it had the prefect kick. my husband had the carne adovado stacks with the red sauce and it was yummy. i could have just ate the carne, red sauce and sopaipillas. everything had flavor but wasnt salty and nothing was bland. its not the traditional mexican meals which is a nice change. i wish they were closer to my house because i visit more often.
thank you nice meal, small intimate place thats good for a get together or family meal
this starbucks is pretty small inside yet the service was really fast and friendly. typical starbucks holiday decor which, was nice. ordered a gingerbread espresso. pretty yummy though not super hot.
really unique and fun ice creams and bars ice cream and fruit!this is like being a kid in a candy store! you really can try all of their ice creams! the employee that helped me was super nice and very helpful, and i was really indecisive because there are so many options.loved their pine nut ice cream! but take the time to try their corn, rice pudding, and soursop ice creams.
received a call from the manager. apparently there was a mix up and he was never notified by his regional office about the complaint. he explained and we had a nice chat, he offered a partial refund which i did not take, but he did offer. after our talk, i would be willing to give them another try and you probably should also.
nous avons reteste pour le ribfest et cette fois ci au menu le combo suivant :  12 rack de ribs 12 lb de porc effiloche salade de chou pour info cest un combo a 19 et a mon sens cela vaut le coup et represente bien ce foodtruck. jen suis ressorti sans faim et avec pas mal de sauce sur les doigts :je reitere donc avec ma remarque de la derniere fois comme quoi le porc effiloche est un de leur point fort. les ribs sont bonnes, bien assaisonnes et bien cuites ! vraiment satisfait de cette nouvelle decouverte :je remonte donc la note a 4 pour les ribs et la qualite du porc effiloche !
on a pris et partage des cotes levees de 8 places. on a bien aime le uncle ... sam?. une cote levee complete etait 23, ce qui nest pas cher pour une cote levee, mais il ny a pas daccompagnement a ce prix la, alors il faut prendre autre chose. la facture grimpe rapidement, mais apres une cote levee, on avait le ventre assez rempli. il ny a pas assez de tables, malgre quon y a ete un lundi soir. a essayer au moins une fois.
un endroit cosy, joli, chaleureux et qui propose des patisseries, salades et meme pizza maison qui font du bien, surtout lors dune apresmidi pluvieuse :
icy sweet goodness sure helped beat the heat on a hot and humid day. theres absolutely no place cool to wait, so be prepared to melt a little while waiting for your treat. lots of flavors and add ons, like like li hing powderwe had the pina colada with a scoop of coconut ice cream and a hawaiian rainbow.
went here last night after some suggestions from friends and family.  very cool place.  it was a bit loud when we got there because the womens soccer team just won the world cup. makes sense lol.  sat in a nice booth near the back and drinks were ready within a few minutes.  i got their juicy lucy, which is a cheddar burger that has the cheese melting on the inside.  i got fries on the side.  the burger wasnt a large burger, but definitely had the charred grilled thing goin and personally i love that.  i probably could have done without the tomato and lettuce as it seem to make it a little hard to eat.  the fries were good, but nothing super innovated.  we enjoyed and i look forward to trying something else next time.
im not into beer so ive been putting off going here. that was a mistake because the burgers are great and make the place. i had the bacon bleu burger and it was excellent. they didnt overdo the cheese and the burger was cooked just right. they give you a ton of french fries. you wont go hungry here!
my brother took me to this new scottsdale hangout on a friday night.  food and service was excellent.  best burger ive had in a long time.dont let the sports bar moniker fool you this establishment, is firmly aimed at the family crowd with build your own mac n cheese and adores you make at your table. i will be back!  give them a try you wont be disappointed!
lots of tvs, 100 beers available split between tap, bottles, and cans, and good food.  come here weekly and cant wait to enjoy during football season.wait staff and bartenders are top notch and have never really had a problem.  only negative is their liquor drinks.  what is considered well at other bars is treated as top shelf here.  be cautious...  a crown  coke is the same 7 that a canadian club  coke is.other than that, beer of the month is always a good choice and well priced.  only negative would say is id like to have seen larger mugs of beer.  they offer pints 16oz, and for 1.50 more you can get a mug 19.5oz.  id prefer to see the larger sizes that zipps down the street offers, but for now itll do.
if there is any sporting event on, this place is very crowded and loud. its definitely a step up from the office, which was there before. very open and lots of room, totally gutted and renovated. huge beer tap selection and tvs on every wall. food was good and service was great as well. its around the corner from my house and ill definitely be back.
good burgers. i dont drink beer. why would anyone want a cold cheeseburger though? shouldnt it be cold beers and hot cheeseburgers???
we started coming here for hh since we live nearby.  its busy, bursting with activity, and overall a fun place to come.  everything is clean since it is a brand new place.  the last time we went my wife tried the macncheese and just didnt like it.  she didnt make a big deal of it but our waitress noticed and visited with her, saying she was sorry.  within minutes the manager appeared and genuinely wanted to know what she did and did not like about it.  he then asked if he could interest her something different and she took him up on his offer of a large warm pretzel and cheese dip.  that was a hit.  it was nice to see the staff and management cared, even while very busy with others.  and yes  the beer is cold!  prices are good too.
all i can say is prime rib sliders and sweet tots! great new addition to the neighborhood!! third time to visit and as always busy , good service and yummy food.
first night and we returned 2 nights latter. the burgers and beer selection are incredible.  the sweet potatoe tots are very good.  i drank 4 different stouts at one location...    pc  some one else drove
my wife and i stopped by to grab a bite to eat last friday night.  the place was packed!  i was pleasantly surprised by the great customer service and how fast the food came out.  the only reason im not going to give them 5 stars is because the food was not amazing.  it was good, but not great and i do not give 5 starts to restaurants that do not have great food.
im always on a lookout for new brunch places to visit on saturdaysunday mornings and i came across this little place. the restaurant has a cute original decor inside and a nice terrace outside.i was pleased that they have my favorite eggs benedict with salmon. the service is good and the food is great. the only downside is that the coffee is not included with your brunch and you have to pay for coffee in addition to your meal.the portions are average, my benedicts came with oven roasted potatoes not super generous on potatoes and some fruit. nevertheless, the eggs and the sauce were up to my standards.id say this is a nice new discovery i made and i would definitely go back there again for brunch.
benedictines are great  ask and they customize add bacon etc. on busy days the staff can get overwhelmed but generally they are warm and welcoming. a safe bet for brunch not tried dinner.
this is the same building as andy foot spa with much of the same staff, too! they just changed owners : i am a long time customer and seeing the change made me a little nervous but the second i arrived, my fears were gone. they upgraded the couch in the waiting area as well as the bathrooms. 1 hour body massage in private room was 40 and comes with a little hot stone action in there too. all of the ladies ive had are great  very strong and sweet. we will be back!
really nice mexican joint in cg. i ordered the carne asada burrito. great price for the amount if food you get. the meat was very tender and flavorful. restaurant is very clean but a little small, but no problem if you dont have a large party.
this place is excellent!  best mexican food in casa grande!  fried fish tacos and sanoran hot dog are great.
wow,  new place in town is giving every other mexican place a run for its money.  carlitos is quickly making a name for itself and its here to stay.   its small so tables can be hard to come by, but that just tells you its worth the wait or hell just get take out cause its thats good.  they not only have some of the best street tacos in cg, but some of the best ive had including the phoenix area.  the carne asada is very good. not chewing or full of fat or greasy.  the salsa is fresh and a great addition to whatever you order.  the service was excellent as well. vey fire fly and happy to bring you more chips and salsa. why go on a juicing diet when there are tacos this good in the world?
i love their chicken tacos here, and their homemade salsa  chips. staff are always very friendly. food is amazing. great atmosphere every time. only thing i wish they had was a separate line for the togo orders. i call ahead of time, and still have to wait in line to get my food, instead of just walking up, paying for it, going, and enjoying the rest of my lunch. everything else is perfect. carlos the owner is awesome.
this is our first visit to carlitos. i ordered the carne asada burrito.  very good.  my wife had the red menudo.  it was good. even though the restaurant is small, it was comfortable and very clean.  even the restroom.  the staff was very friendly and helpful.  they seemed sincerely concerned about our food quality. they have indoor and outdoor dining. we do plan to return to try other menu items before fully judging them. the only concern is that the salsas werent quite spicy enough for us. but they definitely are worth coming back again.
pleased with the food and the service every time. the service is quick and the food is served hot. love that you can see the kitchen and that the owners are so attentive to the customers.thanks for bringing a little taste of ca to cg!
this is hands down the closest thing you will get to baja mex in casa grande. if your from california or are looking for mexican like you get at the taquerias there, carlitos is it. consistency and supply is off a little sometimes but, for the most part its one of the best in cg.
i came here for lunch twice, and its busy but good service. chips and salsa are good, the rest of the food has flavor.
this review is solely on the buffet for dinner. i have been to the regular buca a few dozen times. this one has a buffet offering if you like that is very strange and out of place. they have a a very mediocre set of offerings surrounding an excellent piece of prime rib that made this a four star for the review. there was one italian offering, which was not so good and a decent desert. go for the prime rib and skip everything else but the desert.
had a light lunch off the buffet.   great food and friendly server.     good value for your buck.      least expensive meal while in vegas.  would go again.
we were killing time before our show started at planet hollywood so stopped by here for a quick dinner. the portions were enough for 2 or more people and the service was great. we skipped the buffet, but for a sunday night it was great food and not busy at all.
excellent food, excellent service. i had the lunch buffet, and as soon as i needed anything, they took care of it immediately. nice, friendly atmosphere with a clean appearance to the whole place made it an altogether enjoyable experience.
as someone who recently moved here, i was very impressed with the place.i went around 1:30pm, and it wasnt very busy. i got a panini from them which tasted fine, but it was really their cauliflower soup and my moms croissant sandwich that won me over. and their napoleon tasted great too. nice staff, pretty good food, super fast.
ill first start by saying you can order online for pick up inside or what my girlfriend and i do pick it up through the drive thru. they also have a rewards card for those who are frequent drivers. tip ordering online can really help with enhancing and getting the full value out of your meal. the ability to customize your meal really pays off.the food has always been fresh for me but as others have said the lunch sandwiches can be dry. i tend to agree with that and usually dont get them anymore but the breakfast sandwiches are a thumbs up. i like the roast beef dip sandwich although they could add more roast beef. on the other hand the soups and salads have always been tasty. they have a soup of the day which is nice and the turkey bacon avocado salad is always a winner. their sourcream dressing is amazing. returning to the topic of breakfast, ive had the french toast, sourdough pancakes, omelets and even smoothies which all had great flavor and quality. ive had a few desserts but my favorite was the cream cheese brownie. overall i really like the convenience of the drive thru and the friendly service and when driving up to the menu they say to look at the menu and order when ready. its nice not being asked what you want right away like other fastfood restaurants. as stated earlier, try ordering online and picking up to customize your meal to get the best experience.
excellent bread on the beef dip sandwich. holds the au jou perfectly.  i think the amount of beef on it is fine, but could see where some may want more, if so, order with extra beef.  soups are amazing.  all items in pastry case look fantastic.
well a few things were messed up a bit but other than that i was happy! this place was a lot cuter on the inside that i had expected! i liked that it was like a little shop. they were selling a bunch of different little holiday things when i was there today! although everything was a little too pricey in my opinion.one complaint is that they only list the item name on the menu at the counter. i know there is the paper menu too thats more descriptive, but that wouldve been helpful. the desserts on display looked amazing, the chocolate mousse dome looked especially incredible. one thing that definitely earned points with me was that they were giving out huge samples! like im talking full slices a bread. a bit wasteful as i didnt finish mine but dang it was good. they had multigrain hazelnut bread, snickerdoodle, and pumpkin. the snickerdoodle almost tasted like cake, i loved it! for my meal i ordered autumn bisque soup with quinoa salad with baguette bread. they gave me ciabatta instead of baguette but it looked good so i just ate it and didnt get it fixed. my dad got a sandwich and he didnt know it was going to have mayo on it and contained onions. so he had to replace his sandwich bread with my moms ha. but overall we were all satisfied! the soup was very delicious, was a vegetarian butternut squash soup. the quinoa salad wasnt amazing but wasnt too bad. the bread is definitely the best thing here, yum!
i stop here for gas and coffee often. has what you need but not the nicest convenience store. kind of dirty with sketchy people. however, im in and out so it didnt really bother me. they also have redbox which makes it even more convenient.
im always looking for delicious pho in my area, and when i went to pick my car up a few weeks ago i was ecstatic to find that a new place had opened right in my neighborhood. my husband and i immediately decided to try it out. the interior is clean and they have a nice tv for those interested. the service was friendly and quick. we each had a soup and shared an order of ch giò, which my husband noted was the best hes ever had, i found them quite tasty as well. the soups were top notch! our check that day was very reasonable. right now, the menu is a little small, which is to be expected from a newly opened restaurant. as their customer base grows, i hope theyll add more like boba! ill definitely be back for more!
finally !! a pho joint down the street from my house!! everyone is so friendly and i got my food within 10 minutes. the food is good but not the best pho ive had. will i come back again ? pho sho!
the chicken pho was very good and the place is very nice and clean.  everyone was very friendly.  pho avina was my fave,  but this is right by my house which makes it a winner!
i move to the area about two months ago. ive gone to at least 5 different vietnamese restaurants, in search of the perfect peanut sauce. i found it here!! the spring rolls were great! the menus is small but the prices are the best ive seen. i had bun bo hue since thats what ive ordered everywhere else, so i can compare. i like that they had congealed pigs blood but the meat was dried. i was surprise they didnt do the pigs knuckle like most traditional dishes, the broth was spicy and flavorful without tasting too oily. i will try something else next time. i was so happy about the peanut sauce that i just ordered a few rounds of them. service was great which is not something you find at most vietnamese places.
a really good place for a hot bowl of pho....family friendly place... not expensive at all....love this place
my mom and i came here to get manicures and pedicures together. we were in and out pretty quickly. our nails look great and they offered us wine and soft drinks. we liked the chairs and atmosphere. the overall service was good.
when we walked in the manager white man and the hostess black girl seemed to be in an argument and carried on with their conversation right in front of my boyfriend and i. very unprofessional and rude. once we were seated our waitress asked if we wanted drinks. our waitress eileen was awesome. she carried a great conversation, was very sweet, and consistently asked us if we needed anything. we showed up at happy hour. 2 tacos and 20 margarita pitcher. great price. the food was great...the salsa was bland though...but i am from southern california where the salsa is amazing! overall, the food was great  so was our waitress.
loved it! food was really good and the service was exceptional. easy to get a table and good mexican food. you can go wrong.
i enjoyed the food and atmosphere was nice enough. texmex and everything tasted fresh. host was friendly and our server went out of her way and was quite sweet and bubbly.we had guacamole, cant deny its fresh when its made in front of you! chips had a house made red and verde. chips were made in house also. we were looking for a snack and it was happy hour, 2 soft corn tacos. im a vegetarian vegas hates us. so i got mine with minus the chicken... when our server brought them out she said the cook sent me a bowl of grilled peppers and onions since i was a veg, they were delicious and i was truly grateful for them doing that. something i would ordered wether it be happy hour or not. my friend got the shredded chicken tacos and they were loaded with marinated chicken. she said they were great.refreshing to have a personal touch and fresh food! would have gone back if we had time.
i was staying inside ballys and realized i needed some food before going out to endure a night of drinking. i checked out the menu at the entrance and it looked like a pretty good deal. grabbed a seat at the bar as it was just me and they had some mlp playoff games going so it was a no brainer. josh was working behind the bar and he gave me tips on what i should select from the menu. i got the mahi tacos an order of 3 for 11 which were a delight as he said it would be. nice flavor and a slight kick of spice going on with it...not bad. i was hoping i could mix and match with the 3 for 11 deal, but unfortunately i was told you could only get one flavor with the deal. since i was in a mexican establishment, it was only right to partake in some tequila. it was hard for me not to as i was sitting right in front of a shelf that is fully dedicated to all different types of tequila. i went with the don julio silver for smooth purposes. god spot to grab a quick bite and get on with a night of awesomeness.
we visited last night, and the restaurant was not very busy when we arrived. within about 15 minutes of being there, they became very busy though. i was observing our waitress and how hard she was working. i noticed there were only two 2 waitresses running the entire floor. yikes! this poor girl was busting her bum, and the great service we got showed that. there were people assisting with food running and bussing tables, but these poor girls were still being ran dry. great food, and great service in spite of being understaffed. still, hire some more help! thats not fair to expect one person to serve half of a restaurant. we tipped her extra and i hope she got more help. thats the only reason i gave 4 instead of 5 stars. hang in there waitresses, and dont think some of us arent recognizing your hard work!
this is a new sushi restaurant that opened up where hiromaru or cafe japon used to be. i must say the food is excellent. i ordered the 40 12 course option. i got full right around course 10. its not like any coursing menu as most of the courses are full plates and not just 2 bites per course. next time i think i will do the 10 course option for 27.
can the newest inhabitant of the former cafe de japon  hiromaru ramen spot in cathay plaza achieve longevity? if tonights imperfect yet delicious meal is an indication, then it should.michael k.s glowing review piqued my interest in sushi takashi, and when a friend invited me here, i eagerly accepted. i arrived a bit before the official 5pm start and was greeted by warm employees and cool air. the decor bears little resemblance to past businesses, with wooden tables and floors and bright but not overpowering light.while waiting for my companion, i was able to peruse the a la carte menu and the various combination menu offerings. the three roll combo 25.95 and the bottomless dinner 22.95 both seem like decent options for another time, and even the ayce offering for 79.95 might be worth a splurge on a special occasion when asked, the server said that 2 orders of carpaccio could be included in addition to the premium items listed in fine print.however, id already set my mind on the 12course sushi dinner 39.95, which contains sukiyaki, a choice of oyster or king crab, and a couple of other small upgrades when compared to the 10course dinner 29.95.before critiquing the food, i should note that the flow of the dishes was a little bit rushed at times, but nothing was left out too long, and they postponed dessert until we were ready.complimentary appetizer: kakinotane. rice crackers with soy and wasabi flavorings. great crunch. the wasabi packs a punch if youre not accustomed to it.1: edamame. my friends peperoncino didnt add much flavor, but i loved my choice of garlic. perfectly cooked beans to boot.2: carpaccio. yellowtail and scallop, shared. both were delightfully fresh, and the roe was a nice topping for the scallop. best dishes of the night.3: salad. sampled some of my friends tofu w salmon skin. some of the better tofu that ive had for sure, but the skin was a little too charred for my taste. my soba salad was ridiculously good with a powerful but not sickeningly heavy dressing, slick noodles, and substantial and tasty grilled salmon.4: teriyaki meat. the beef was tasty and grilled, and it was more tender than tough. i see no reason to choose chicken unless beef is strictly outside of your diet.5: sushi roll shared. the king club roll featured king crab, although i hesitate to call it the star. its flavor was lost until eaten alone. i wouldnt order it again since the proportion of the crab isnt sufficient. the second roll, blue diamond, was the better option. it featured salmon, cucumber, and super white tuna in garlic ponzu.6: seafood cold dish. we both chose oysters. each plate featured four plump oysters an apparent downsize from prior weeks and a parsley garnish. they were thoroughly fresh, plump, and flavorful, and as of this writing have not assaulted either of our digestive systems. id pick this again as well.7: fried food. we both chose tempura, which is a generous basket of three shrimp tempura and six vegetable tempura. the batter was a little too prominent and the sauce a little too weak. id pick something else next time.8: beef. we both had sukiyaki, which was presented in a very hot bowl. this is where we started to exceed capacity, and the best thing about this not being an ayce meal is that doggybagging something is not a problem. i did eat a small portion, and it was delightful with tender beef, silky tofu, and a sweet broth.9: hot entree. we both chose the mini doria. id liken it to lasagna, but with rice. this ground beef and rice bowl is out of place on the menu because of its prominent tomato flavoring. its good, but the 4 piece baked roll would better match the menu and not require stomach expansion. but hey, more leftovers!10: miscellany. i went into left field with the burger. with gooey cheese, toasted bun, and onions, its surprisingly tasty. the medium doneness of the patty was acceptable. however, the fries that accompanied the burger were not so good. they were salted properly and fluffy inside, but their exteriors were mostly devoid of any sort of crunch. i would skip the burger solely to avoid having to see the pale yellow potato pieces ever again.11: soup. creamy corn sounds good, but it was very watery. i was almost too full to care at this point, but its a shame that good egg and corn would have their flavor so diluted.12: dessert. nothing special about my friends matcha jelly with ice cream. my tempura ice cream wasnt exceptional either, but the sweetness of the toppings somehow hit the spot at the right time. neither choice can be mistaken for gourmet or premium.despite some flaws, the meal was great. i could see myself returning soon. the poster outside highlights the history of chef takashi as a pioneer of ayce in las vegas, but his featured nonayce offerings would satiate all but the most stretchystomached. and hey, theres even a stamp card for 10 and 12course dinner.
i often search hot and new when im not particularly in the mood for something specific. i enjoy being the guinea pig for a new restaurant in town!  ...aaaand this is how i ended up at sushi takashi for a solo dinner tonight!  i arrived at about 8:30, and the restaurant was pretty empty. kawika was my server and took care of me from start to finish.  he filled my water, took my order, brought out all of my food, and took my dirty dishes.  he was very attentive and although it was slow, seemed to have that sense of urgency i appreciate in a full service restaurant. i ordered the 15.95 combo plate with 2 orders of teriyaki chicken and a half order of the hakodate signature roll yellowtail, ponzu, jalapeno. to drink, i just had water. food came out quick and was plated beautifully. i started with the salad which was definitely overdressed, but still delicious. ill ask for light dressing next time. the chicken was thin cut love it when japanese restaurants do this! and the sauce was watery, but it didnt seem to take away from the flavor. maybe its just a housemade teriyaki sauce?!  either way, no complaints.  the roll was delicious. i love when sushi rolls have slices of jalapeno on top that are effective enough to taste  have a little bit of the seeds still attached. i hate those itty bitty small jalapeno slices that some sushi places put on top. where do they even get jalapenos that small?!  lol. miso soup came with the meal and was ok.  i literally ate everything off of the plate, including the ginger. lol. i was satisfied, but was craving something sweet...so i opted for the fried oreos 4.95.  how do you mess up fried oreos?!  i mean, really you cant!  yum. yum. yum. my check was 22, great value for what i got! i definitely want to come back with my boyfriend and go for the 12 course meal that ive read about from fellow yelpers!  will update my review after i wake up from that coma. :p.s. they have the best tasting tap water ever. i saw a sign on the wall that says its fuji water or something...not sure what that is, but it was really good and definitely worth mentioning. i love when restaurants add little perks like that. its those small things that leave the biggest impact!
i didnt partake of the 10 or 12course meal of insanity, but theres really no way around it: no matter what you get here, you will eat a monstrous amount of food. i appreciate that they offer several specials as well as typical a la carte options, and the menu itself is extensive, with several apps, a giant page of rolls, and everything in between.chicken karage: so crispy, so juicy! i love japanese fried chicken, and the version put out here is done just right.salmon skin salad: holy giant portions, batman! this salad alone could easily be a lunch, packed with fish not just skin, fruit, and an ample amount of fresh veggies in a light, flavorful dressing. nice variety of textures, too.3 roll combo: this option allows you to pick three special rolls, and get bottomless miso soup, house salad, and dessert various ice creams for a crazylow 26, which is easily enough food for two people but at a cost that rivals the ayce pricing elsewhere. the miso was standard but the house salad was the first ive come across in an asian restaurant that included avocado! add some of the chicken from your karage app and this could easily be a safe meal for a kid or picky eater. opted for the nagasaki great cilantro sauce!, the orange lemon citrus  seafood  love, and the sapporo just enough spice and found them all unique and tasty, with fresh fish, minimal rice, and tasty but not overpowering sauces. the food was so tasty that we kept ordering and my stomach staged a revolt after the onslaught of food. but in a good way. pricing is very fair: even a sashimi appetizer plate for two 10 pieces is an extremely reasonable 15. ill definitely be coming back in addition to the amazing food, the service is on point ask for jeffrey!, and the interior is a fun mix of classy and rustic. note: you can buy a 12 shirt and get 10 off on future visits when you wear it! i havent done that yet, but if we come back often enough, i might just have to.
the sashimi here is exceptional.  finally, a decent japanese restaurant knows how to prepared sashimi at the proper temperature.    sashimi is supposed to serve in a very cold temperature, especially in summer.   theres plenty of room for improvement.  40person for 12 courses are just way too big for one person.  the server should rethink when upselling an additional course.  my friend and i went to this restaurant, we wanted to share the 12 course menu for 39.99. the server told us, we must order one more dish sashimi plate 15.00.  we cant share without ordering this additional dish.  we did just that! whatever the green tea that was served tasted muddy and extremely bitter.  we ate the following: 25 the sashimi plate for 2. 15.00 i spat out a fish bone out of my salmon sashimi.  this is reason the rating is so low on this dish is no bone should ever been in a sashimi plate. i would have given a 4.55 with this dish if it werent for the bone25miso soup: a little thin in taste.  we can barely tasted miso.  the soup in way too thin. 55.  the oyster: its perfect!!15.  the special roll: king crab. the crab and avocado together tasted bitter after first bite. we stop continue to finish this plate.45. tofu salad:   it was nicely done. 55 squid ika carpaccio:  it was very well flavored.  we could barlely continue at this point.  3.55 sukiyaki: the favor is better than most places,  we were way too stuffed at this point and call it a quit.  pack the rest home.  the speed of service was 25.  the server doesnt pay any attention to the progress we were making.  the table was too over crowded.  the lack of expediting control in our case.  it came out too fast with a smallest table they can mustered. friendliness: 2.55.  0: serve food without attentiveness: zombie server or robot servers. 2.5: served with smile and quick to response. rooms for improvements. 4.5:  server with a warm heart.  genuinely courteous.  the attentiveness: 15.  we have to wave down a server when needed, it takes times to wave down someone for service on a friday night.   server should always be one step ahead to observe if the customers need anything, clearing of plates, refill drinks.  we actually have to wave them all down for this service.  sorry, the servers are not trained properly. there are a few things that tasted great here. i would consider returning and may possible update my reviews.
i love this place! yas, i sure do.the only thing is... the person i went with and i felt a little under the weather the next day. to be honest, i dont care but it was worth it.service: 35decent. we made reservations and our table was ready for another 10 minutes. the attentiveness was average but they werent intrusive. our table still needed to be set up even after we sat down. food: 4.55it would be a 5 if my stomach didnt hurt the next day. but like i said, i would be more than happy to come back for more. it was delicious and fresh. everything was flavorful and had good presentation. tempura ice cream is also one my favorites so they already had once i knew they had it on the menu.ambience: 55 we got a booth and it was super kyoooot. ; it was super busy and everybody looked like they were enjoying themselves minus the staff.overall, id say its one of the better places for sushi and i still plan on going again to try new desserts, their happy hour and to try the 12 course meal again.
came here with my sister and my mom for my moms birthday, and we had a pleasant experience. i definitely knew i wanted to try their set course dinner, but my family has a small appetite. we ended up getting a 10 course and a 12 course to share. we were served by two people during a dinner, a male and female i wish i got the guys name because he was great!. our waiter let us know that because the courses are usually for one person, we would have to order something off the menu in order to let us share. i didnt mind this. heres what we tried:1 garlic and original edamame: definitely get the garlic edamame.2 salmon and tuna carpaccio: i think these two plates were some of my favorites of the course. at the end of the course, even though my stomach was about to explode, i wanted more of this. 3 soba and tofu salad: my mom ate most of both of these by herself because she enjoyed the dressing. her small appetite was such lie!4 beef and salmon teriyaki: this was given to us towards the end of our course, and i was so scared for the portion size because i was getting full. however, i thought the size was just perfect. it was a little bit on the overcooked side though.5 blue diamond roll, forgot name?, and baked fantasy: all of these were recommended by our waiter, and we loved them. when he recommended forgot name, we were like uhhhh how could you forget the name of one your favorite rolls??! but thats actually what it was called and got a good laugh out of it. baked fantasy melted in our mouths.6 oysters: im not a huge fan of oysters, but i chose this for my mom since its her birthday gotta treat her like what she actually is...a queen. after being disappointed by the quality of oysters in vegas, she was amazed by how great it was here.7 tempura and karaage: didnt care much for them...i thought the fried batter on the tempura was too thick and the karaage was dry.8 sukiyaki: expected from a sushi place, the interior was cold. having this made us feel better and the beef is reaaallllyyy good in this. also came with noodles.9 grilled asparagus and agedashi tofu: i loved the grilled asparagus so much that i pretty much had to fight my family for it. agedashi tofu was okay to me. maybe because i prefer the tofu to not be fried? 10 salmon bowl: my family and i are salmon lovers so choosing this was a nobrainer. no regrets about this. the salmon was fresh and the texture of it was really silky..cant think of a better term. try it!11 miso soup: naturally chose this option since none of us are fans of creamy soups. i thought it was more on the bland side, but i drank this while eating the fried food tempura and karaage, so i made it work but balancing out fried and bland?? does this logic even actually make sense..12 coffee jelly w ice cream and strawberry ice cream: it was a bit too sweet for my preference, but i was still able to enjoy it.tl;drfresh seafood. huge variety and combinations that theres bound to be something that works for you. make sure you have an appetite if you opt for the course dinners..and loose pants. service was really good at first, but it went downhill for us at the end of our meal. a huge party entered, and the entire staff was waiting for them so i guess they forgot about us. however, i will no doubt be back again!!
our first experience at takashi was amazing  the food was good, not great, but the presentation and value was out of this world. 12 courses for 40 and a lot of the choices are really quite tasty. unfortunately, the second time we went was a little disappointing because they werent presenting the courses the same way.for example, our oysters came in a boat the first time, on a small white plate the second time. and our sukiyaki came in a big old style pot while the second time it was a smaller and less stylistic pot.that being said, the value is still there and if you go for one of the smaller options, you can still get a ton of value here. but value isnt everything and the food could still be better.
with all the ayce sushi places in town, how could takashi compete? well, for one, you get seated right away and they have great selections to choose from...for a price. i know people out there who love to give bad reviews because a place is expensive  stay away!depending on what youre interested in cooked entrees, sushi, everything, theres a set for you. for the average ayce sushi goers, id recommend the takashis bottomless dinner for 23 which includes salad, carpaccio or sashimi, miso soup, cooked entree and a roll. they also have 10course dinner set and a 12course dinner set.but what i always come here for is the salmon overflow bowl. for 30 you get salad, miso soup and lots of salmon sashimi theres rice underneath all the salmon. if youre a big fan of salmon like i am, this is worth it. i normally get seconds because it is a lot of salmon. they have different rolls and nigiri and other items you can order ala carte. the fish is always fresh and the cuts are good.
if you are looking for an ayce sushi place... keep looking further! sorry, but this probably wont be the place for ayce tonight. however, if youre looking for something different and japanese, then youve found the right place. sushi takashis ayce prices are outrageous i called to ask and it was somewhere like 7080! no way, jose! but fortunately, they do offer a 10 and 12 course meal for a more reasonable price 29.95 and 39.95 respectively. perhaps that is why... to steer people away from ayce!anyhow, my dad and i ordered the 12 course meal which was maybe a little much... we had to take a few items home. we could have done with the 10 course meal, but both of us were starving and underestimated the amount of food we could eat. nonetheless, you do get a big bang for your buck. the food came out at a very consistent pace, though slightly out of order at times. our server was also very helpful.lets began with the food itself, shall we...course 1: edamame original  garlicmy dad and i ordered two different edamame. i much prefer the garlic flavored one over the original. however, the garlic flavor was quite strong so it may not be your cup of tea if you are looking for a subtle start.course 2: carpaccio beef  salmonboth were good but i much prefer the beef carpaccio. course 3: soba salad grilled salmon  grilled shrimpmy dad and i ordered the same thing, different topping. this was one of my favorite dishes  if not the one favorite dish  and i wouldve ordered more of this if i could. delicious! hands down, get the grilled salmon. grilled shrimp was mediocre, and im a shrimp lover.course 4: sushi 4pc nigirinigiri was pretty good. nothing spectacular and it wasnt the highlight of my meal, but you can tell it wasnt yucky old fish. the sashimi pieces were smooth.course 5: cold dish oyster  snow crabboth were good! if i had to choose one, id probably choose the oysters.course 6: vegetable agedashitofu  sauteed asparagustofu tasted old or like its been sitting out and warmed up. would definitely prefer the asparagus.course 7: teriyaki chicken  beefthe beef teriyaki was very dry and tasted a little overcooked, but was flavored so well. the chicken was perfect in every way. i love beef teriyaki normally but this time around i prefer the chicken.course 8: deep fry karaage  tempurai dont like deep fried dishes as an overall personal preference... but the karaage was pretty good. i enjoyed it more than i thought i would, which says a lot since i dont like deep fried dishes!course 9: beef dish sukiyakiso good! a little on the sweeter side than some other places sukiyaki, but still good. this was actually a lot more food than the previous courses, so i ended up taking this home for next days lunch. still good!course 10: special roll 4pcyou have a choice of ordering one roll from the special rolls section. i ordered the yokohama and it was decent. i preferred the one my dad ordered, which was the steak roll.course 11: soup corn  egg soup  misoloved the corn and egg soup and the miso soup was made really well, too.course 12: dessert tempura ice cream  shaved icei absolutely loved the tempura ice cream... i wouldve ordered more if i wasnt already in a food coma by this time. im a huge fan of tempura ice cream but for some reason the one here was really the cherry on top of my 12course meal.
hot sign is oni am so glad to see that krispy kreme opened their doors for business on tuesday. the hot glazed donuts from krispy kreme are one of those experiences everyone should experience at least once in a lifetime. hot, light, and fluffy. i could eat a dozen by myself and for a mere 10 a dozen, what a delicious treat for a reasonable price.   if you have never visited a krispy kreme to experience a  hot glazed donuts then you must take advantage of the opportunity if you ever find yourself in the area.
great doughnuts! stopped by this morning and bought 4 dozen to take to work. i was expecting a huge line but i walked right up to the counter and was out in less than 5 minutes.
had to try the new krispy kreme in its first week! when we walked in, there werent any donuts coming down the line. it took a minute from them to start coming out. we watched the donuts make their way into the oil and on to the waterfall of glaze. its fun to watch.when we walked up to the counter, a lady informed us that their machine had broken and there would be a 40 minute wait for fresh donuts, or we could get another kind. that explains why there was a guy standing outside by the drive thruto notify people there were no original glazed available. it was a little disappointing, but not a deal breaker. i observed that several donuts were clearly in the wrong spots in the display case. we also didnt see any peach pie or lemon kreme cake donuts. we decided to split a chocolate frosted donut and cinnamon apple filled. yum yum! well have to go back when they have hot donuts.
i never had a hotoffthebelt glazed donut until today so i really didnt know what the fuss was about.  now i know what the fuss is about.  im still a shipley donuts fan texas chain but their glazed is pretty damn good.  the ones already out though, meh, its all right.  my ice coffee wasnt made correctly but the folks working there were really nice.  they were just super busy so i didnt feel like going back.  we were greeted warmly and they were very patient with my indecisive 4  year old.  i would definitely come back.
we bought a dozen of glazed, chocolate glazed, brownie and cake! they were fresh and warm! we went trough the drive thru and the guy was real helpful even have us hats for our two kids!
i always get lucky and the light is on. nothing beats a hot fresh off the line krispy kreme donut!
always bummed out when we go that they are not actually making donuts but it is always fun to go and eat there. yummo and so happy they are on the west side!
latereviewi came in drawn by the 30 minute foot massage deal, walked out after an hour and a half by doing the 90 minute reflexology instead! i wish i couldve spoken up about the therapist applying more pressure but i was too tired to voice my concerns since i passed out and woke up feeling refreshed. at the end, i did their cellspa ion foot spa upgrade to get the toxins out mind you ive never done it so i said to myself why not? and apparently that machine detoxified my liver according to the color chart that i was given after being shown the water and its contentsall in all i enjoyed my massage. its right next to gelatology so if i dont feel like driving around town to find a good foot massage, ill definitely try them again out of convenience :3
i love the laser hair removal services here. the technicians are great especially erin. erin is taking care of me since last 2 years. the prices are competitive. simplicity laser uses yag technology for laser hair removal treatment which is proven to be very effective laser hair removal treatment with compare to other hair removal technology that only simulates the unwanted hair growth. i pay about 74 bucks a month for full body laser hair removal treatment which is way better than waxing and other painful hair removing techniques, and they are not cheap either. one would easily spend more than 150 bucks just for waxing full arms and legs.
the new owners are trying to improve quality of items served.  cake prices are very reasonable.  bakery items seem to be fresh.  very good variety.  coffee set up could be improved.  being a local small town family owned business, community support will be vital to keep quality.
a great hometown bakery! i love finding these types of places tucked in and around charlotte. with comfortable seats, a clean and fresh atmosphere and yummy desserts, you cant go wrong! the prices are more than fair and everything has been fresh. this is a nice quiet place to go for a doughnut or two to share and a glass of milk to wash it down. dont expect a starbucks or coffee house vibe. this isnt it and for that, i am grateful! its a family place but yes, the coffee is great too.
i love the variety of baked goods offered.  the cinnamon apple filled donut, banana nut muffin and tomato basil bagel are among my favorites.  the staff are friendly and helpful.
awesome! i stopped eating donuts other than krispy kreme years ago! but my husband would occasionally bring donuts home for the kids, he told me how good they were and i finally broke down and tried them... fresh  delicious!!! i am a believer and their cupcakes, while expensive are good too! the red velvet is a tasty treat!
great place for all kinds of sweets, the coffee is good too! i will def be going back here to support this local business.
a good place, but perhaps a little... confused.we had never been to a first watch before, so were excited to try this one out. our hostess took great pains to tell us how this location was focusing on using fresh, local ingredients in everything. she then set down a pot of coffee for us and let us look over the menu.we poured the coffee and realized the only creamer we could get wasnt fresh or local, but was little prepackaged creamer cups on the table. being a fan of local coffee roasters, when she came back i asked where the coffee beans came from and she said it was their own brand and packaged out of state. she made a point of telling me i could buy some when i left.so the first two things the fresh and local focused place did was offer us fake creamer and out of state roasted beans. we were getting nervous.fortunately things picked up from there. i tried the avocado toast, which was fantastic. no skimping on the avocado here, and it was lightly seasoned to let the natural taste shine through. my wife had a skilled, which was also really well done and tasty.they have a nice section of their menu focusing on healthy and lighter fair, which im looking forward to trying on future visits.we could tell the staff was new, but they were trying hard and im sure they will work out the kinks shortly. the place is cute and decorated well, and their patio looks promising when it cools down a bit.i was surprised when i was asked to name a tip amount at the register rather than being able to write it on the receipt like most places, but perhaps that is how all the first watches do it.so i think my concern came from the way they set expectations. if they hadnt been touting fresh and local so much i probably wouldnt have wondered about it. the coffee was good no matter where it came from, but i do think the creamercups were a bit cheesy.well definitely be back, but well pay less attention to their branding and focus on finding more dishes we like as much as the ones we had today.
awesome breakfast or lunch find. a new spot, three weeks old, here at 32nd and camelback. we walked by last week and im glad i returned for lunch. was torn between the chef salad or the chorizo omelette. went with the omelette and it was terrific. only thing i wished for was an espresso which they did not have.
im not typically a fan of breakfast chain restaurants but first watch is very close to where i live, and ive heard good things about their other locations so i decided to give it a try. ive been here twice so far and have learned that their menu varies from their other restaurants which makes it seem less corporate and more local. each time ive visited the wait was around 5 10 minutes, not too bad for a saturday and sunday. they offer a large array of breakfast and lunch options, and specials that are seasonal. i tried the avocado toast on my first visit and my husband had the chikichangas. on my second visit i had the vegd out omelet and my husband had the turkey burger. we both enjoyed our food at each of our visits, my dishes were simple yet tasted delicious and fresh. its nice to have a casual and reasonably priced option in the biltmore area because there are very few around. they also have healthy options, so when my husband wants to indulge which is most of the time and im trying to stay disciplined this places offers something for both of us. first watch stands out among the other breakfast chain restaurants, i will definitely be adding this into my rotation.
first time here and i have to tell you the service and food were beyond my expectations.our server kim was amazing!great suggestions and took the time to explain the menu which made all the difference in the world.this is a new concept for them, rustic fresh and natural farm to table from local suppliers.their pumpkin pancakes  cherry wood  bacon and chicken apple sausage are definite must in my book
the food was really good and our server was the best.... everyone was really nice including the manager will def eat at this place again!
great place for breakfast. the blueberry pancakes are fantastic. i would recommend everyone should try it. can wait till the next visit.
first watch is a successful chain restaurant that specializes in breakfast and brunch. having been to first watch restaurants in the midwest, i thought i would try the new restaurant off camelback road in the biltmorearcadia district. first off the decor is very pleasing and upscale compared to traditional fw restaurants which historically appear more country casual nicer than but similar in color genes as the ihop. this fw maybe the nicest i have seen. expecting the solid but straight forward food of old, fw has picked up its game. the steel cut oatmeal was well presented with fruits and even herbs added. it came with a nice muffin. the pancake was perfectly made and tasty but was not unique i prefer the untraditional thicker ones with the fruits cooked inside. no complaints with his pancake though. the juices have expanded from ordinary bottled oj to option of kale or carrotginger infused drinks. i had the latter which was as good as a juice bar. service was friendly and abundant though my polite server was maybe the least of the attentive of those that i saw. while the inside is nice, i would have liked outside seating option that is lightly covered. theres was encased in concrete with openings. makes it somewhat dark. in conclusion definitely worth going. it is not a risky proposition and the price is chain right. good game pickup fw.
tried the triathlete omelette and was very impressed! hearty and tasty with thick wheat toast in the side.. made for a filling lunch! great service and wide variety of options to choose from! was surprisingly slow for lunchtime on a friday though.
wow this place is good. only complaint is it will ruin your calorie count for the week. but for a splurge it is hard to beat. great cheesesteaks, chicken cheesesteaks and the fries are insane. fries offered regular  or  cheese  bacon  ranch!
what could go wrong with a steak that is freshly grilled when you order it ...nothing.there is something about being able to watch your food being cooked right in front of you, that for me is a winner.the ingredients are fresh and half the battle is won when you can customize it to your taste. its one of the best subs that i have had in a while and there is no doubt that i will be back for more.also dont forget to try their gourmet friescheese,bacon  cheese.the menu is simple and straight but the food will leave you drooling.go get a napkin!
so the much anticipated soft opening of wooden robot brewing finally happened this weekend!  so stoked!!!  a great space... ive been stalking their facebook page and their construction progress... super exciting that they are getting ready to finally open.i did a flight of their beers and they were all pretty awesome.  so far they have their overachiever pale ale, willie saison, what hes having ipa, and what shes having dbl ipa.  i really like their branding and their logo... their tap handles kick butt too.  pretty impressed with the soft opening and the space in general.  welcome to south end wooden robot!!!!
wowzers!! not even officially open tonight and the place was packed! talk about hitting the ground running!!the much anticipated taproom has a sleek, minimalist feel; streamlined and kinda sexy.love the logo, custom glasses and tshirts! beer hier!the beer is definitely fresh and tasty. kudos for breaking out of the belgian box and making some ipas! just four on tap to start, but next week there will be at least twice that many!!the overachiever pale ale is a homerun: a really nice nose and chock full of mellow flavors! if you like the floral blossom of  a saison, this one will please your palate! the ill have what shes having double ipa gets an a for effort with some pineapple notes!!so forget what you heard about just making belgians!! wooden robot is bringing their a game!!
whats not to like! another great brewery option in charlotte. a nice, open tap room and a modest, shaded outdoor area with a small view of uptown. even though you cant park in the adjacent lot, theres always been plenty of parking in surrounding areas when ive visited. beer has been great so far, even though they have fewer options than some other breweries i think i heard around 8 after their grand opening, formerly 4. if i had to compare it to somewhere else, so far i would say its similar to triple c atmosphere wise. i also love that they have small, medium and large sizes! definitely a place ill go back to often.
we came here for the first time saturday afternoon. it was busy but not overly slammed. the place inside is very clean looking and there is a glass mirror so you can see inside the brew space. plenty of tables and spaces at the bar. for the majority of the beers, they offer three sizes. a small about 4 oz or so and 2, a medium about 810 ounces and 4 or so and a large about 1216 ounces and 56. i liked the different sizes cause you can just try small samples and make your own flight with as many beers as you liked.they had about 10 beers on tap. a few were collaborations with other breweries in the area. my husband ordered the what hes having, which is an ipa and i got the what shes having, which is a double ipa. named appropriately cause females have double the awesomeness!! both our beers were delish. not crazy hoppy but definitely on point. add in the awesome naming of the brewing, we cant wait to return back!
its only in its infancy, but wooden robot is a hit. the taproom is a cool place with lots of different areas, both indoors and out, to sit. it was packed when i went, but my wife and i lucked out and snagged a couch. if its busy, you might have to stand around for a while before finding a seat. i was blown away by the beers. i was pleased to see three ipas on the menu, including the great what shes having double ipa, which had some nice floral notes and was a solid beer. there were two local collaborations on the menu as well, including paranoid android, a collaboration with birdsong, and my favorite i tried, good morning vietnam, which was a coffee vanilla blonde ale. ive had those flavors before in beers, but usually only in stouts and porters. pair them with a blonde, and you have something magical. besides the great beer, i really like how wooden robot offers different sizes of each beer they serve. they dont do flights, but they do a small, medium, and large size of all of the beers no large size for the strongest ones, though. a small will run you 2.50, medium is 4, and a large is 6. stronger beers, like the dipa, are a bit more. growler fills arent bad, but a new growler will set you back 12. their growlers are pretty darn cool though hingetops, cool shape. overall, i have accepted my new robot overlords, and i will return as a faithful servant.
with so so so many dope new breweries pooping up all over the queen city whats to set a place apart?1. plenty of seating2. nice outdoor space3. dogs allowed bonus for me, maybe not for you4. wide range of beers on tap5. in a wide range of sizes! want a taste? wooden robot has a 2 pour for that. yummy innovative flavors plus traditional ones if you want their twist on a standby. park carefully here. dont get towed!
we got a flight and two additional small pours, and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the beer. the what shes having imperial ipa was probably our favorite! also  they had some pretty punny beer names house of the rye saison comes to mind unfortunately, we came on a friday when food truck friday was going on and, as a result, parking was somewhat of a nightmare  as there isnt much nearby that isnt reserved for other businesses.  i dont know if that issue could be easily remedied, but it is the only thing holding me back from returning frequently.
my signature move is to order a flight on my first visit to a brewery. definitely impressed, it came with one more beer than the usual 4 count. the must have of the night was the goodmorning veitnam vanilla coffee blonde ale. probably a placebo effect, but i felt like i had more pep in my step. great vibe overall but had to find a parking spot on fridays due to the food truck rally.
wooden robot seems to be doing a lot of things right. a good location, nice interior and a patio area, and tasty beers. we sat inside with a flight of 5 beers and had a good time. their flight caddies are pretty nifty and i enjoyed their glassware. 2 or 2.50 per small pour. my two favorites ended up being the overachiever and what shes having, but i enjoyed the berliner weisse as well. paired with brass tap nearby, this street suddenly has some life to it. truthfully, youd have to do something fairly offensive for me not to enjoy a new brewery in town.
they have an excellent selection of beer and i enjoyed all the ones i tried. the best part is you can get 2 short pours, so you can try a bunch of types of beer without getting drunk or spending a lot of money. the bartenders were really nice and the crowd was good on a thursday night.parking is a little tough, but youll find it eventually.
my favorite brewery that we visited this time on brewery day in charlotte! i loved the name, glassware, interior and garage door that opened. boyfriend and i decided to split all of the beers which were 5oz pours for 2 or 2.50 depending on the beer. favorites included the sweet tater pie, razz hands, house of the rye saison and nothing to see here. definitely recommend if you are in the charlotte!
ive been here several times. i think the brewery has a nice vibe to it. few times ive been here it has been very busy. the outside patio area is nice and relaxed, though smaller than some other breweries. i thought the what shes having double ipa was fantastic. my wife got a raspberry saison that was also very good. they had a good truck parked out front when ive been here, but i havent tried it yet. overall, a good welcome addition to the area. and its not too far to walk to the panthers stadium from here. parking is a little tricky. there is a nice lot, right next to the brewery, with a sign that says they will tow your car. so, be careful to find an approved spot to park.
i was surprised when i entered the brewery. from the outside it doesnt look like much. when you enter, it is open with tons of room. i love the quirky names of the beer and there is a wide variety. the razz hands is my favorite so far. i appreciate the fact that the brewery decided to put up sound barriers so there is not a lot of echo and noise when there are large crowds unlike sycamore. i do wish there was more outdoor space, especially because we have a dog that we take around with us. overall, i really like this addition to charlottes breweries and i will be visiting again.
grillades pylos just opened up last week, replacing a resto that used to be called jardinos. pylos is greek themed and delivers favorites from this cuisine. im a huge greek food fan so i couldnt wait to visit it... and it was great stuff!i went with the lunch menu option of their gyro, which was a table dhote for 13 that consisted of a soup, main meal and dessert. the mushroom soup was excellent. the plate consisted of was gyro, potatoes, salad, rice with a side of tzatziki. the gyro was very good, i also loved the thick green style potatoes. the tzatziki was just right. the salad and rice was solid additions as well. the dessert option was limited to one kind of cake and it was alright. coffee was included as well.the ambiance is very nice with attentive staff. service was excellent. the pricetag is pretty solid. i think youre in for a good deal. all in all, ill be back here over and over again if they keep this up.
great new greek restaurant. my second visit here already. everything is awesome. i told them the only think they are missing is some lamb in their gyro. this would bring them to a 5 star.
great greek restaurant that fellow yelper jason brought me to as original lunch meetup was closed. previously this used to be jaridinos. i asked one of the people working there why jaridinos closed and she mentioned the owners didnt pay their rent for almost a year so the landlord got pissed. lol one year at a restaurant without paying rent?!?! thats crazy man in borat voice. now it is a refreshed greek restaurant. my order was the pork gyro platter with salad and thick cut fries. what they brought out was enough meat for 2 hungry guys or 34 women. i couldnt finish it and provided some to my friend. also i took a generous portion home. if you have a huge appetite this is your place! chomedy has a plethora of greek places but this joint fits the nrighborhood well! meal was fantastic and im coming back as it was the real deal for value! reason for not 5 stars was my meat was somewhat overcooked. otherwise a strong 4.5 stars! opa!
the food here is very good we had the souvlaki platters. the service was very very slow. would go back
checked out the dumplings at zenzen taste. tasted all four flavors.  good!
very good beef tenderloin, steer clear of the spicy chicken. overall good experience, and impressed with the atmosphere.
such a better option then subway across the street.  the staff is extremely friendly and quick!  my food is ready to go within a minute after placing the order.  i tend to come in late 1015 minutes before closing because of my night classes, im still always greeted by super courteous employees. aj is awesome!! quality control, i never have to be afraid about an off night or bad order!  no matter what i order i can come to expect a fresh sandwich and a super affordable price.  solid location with friendly service and constant quality has me coming back multiple times a week.
pricey 15 per takeout for most meats, but good authentic flavours and genuine portion.i dont usually get takeout next to home, but after countless times seeing africancanadian people walk out of hot africa with takeouts, i decided to give it a try with the roasted lamb with fried plantain for 15. the lamb was flavourful not salty and falloffthebone tender. i liked the fried plantains, theyre a little sweeter than sweet potatoes, but a full portion was a little more than enough  i now take take half rice. on a second visit, i had the chance to try the bar braise which i understand to be braised seabass. its a whole fish, fried and grilled as pictured on the menu. it had the same green sauce seasoning as the grilled chicken. neither of them were as flavourful as the lamb but decent.do call a halfhour in advance so you can pick up and go. and oh, do ask for the piment. it goes well with fried plantain. cash only.
this is a really great place: friendly and straightforward. i would recommend the fish, which was crispy outside and tender within, glazed with a green pepper sauce and possessing a slightly smoked aroma. rice was also very good, cooked with a red pepper, and the plantains were sweet and plump, not too greasy. i asked for some hot sauce, and the waitress brought me some piquant green salsa that was very delicious. it is byob as well. there is a bit of a ventilation issue, so bring your inhaler if youre an asthmatic, but overall i found the place enjoyable and will definitely return.
very friendly staff and delicious food. lacys is a welcome addition to downtown urbana.
chicken was moist and delicious.  i have been there 3 times and each time they have been out of french fries.  for goodness sake take it off the menu, if you dont have them.  i would have given this place 5 stars, but i like my fries.  this place is so much better than black dog.  i just dont get it, i have been to black dog twice and each time the line was out the door and each time i couldnt eat the nasty food, had to give it to my dog.  i guess thats where their name comes into place.
your standard good bbq place.  urbana is lucky to have this place.menu is comprehensive but not spawling, a good sign that they are focused on what they do well.  the owners are bbq professionals with a colorful history.food was tasty and portions satisfactory.very nice interior.prices normal.waitstaff friendly, almost too much so.
fine ill be the first non 5 star. its great to hear that the creative brain that made art of flavors all the rave finally reopened under another name gelatology. im sure a lot of fans of the desyree ran aof are very excited and swarm the place every day since theyve opened right here in the sw. inside your presented with a variety of unique gelato and sorbetto flavors. im definitely a fan of that, the unique flavors. at the time they had nutella rocky road, rosemary creme brulee, pear and gorgonzola cheese to name some of the flavors. you can sample pretty much all of them, though i try not to do so many at one time. be on the look out for their flavors of the day. i went with the peanut butter and espresso liquid gelato bar. its basically a shake. you can select from the salted caramel, cookies and cream, espresso, peanut butter, and fior di latte. i liked it. im easy to please and will probably do the cookies and cream next time.im not to big of a fan as others hence the non 5 star but glad that shes back. shes very friendly and i wish her all the success with gelatology. maybe ill stop by for a fat elvis or one the flavors of the day.
im going to have to try this place again on an empty stomach. my boyfriend and i had just finished a delicious and filling meal at island flavor when we decided to go to serenade for tea. both of us knew that gelatology had opened recently, and we made the fateful decision to take a gander at the new shop. we tried so hard to keep a distance from the dazzling displays of baked goods and gelato. we really did. but then, the woman behind the display coaxed us not to be shy and reeled us in with free samples. before we could even protest, she teased us with a sample each ... followed by 3 more samples each! by then, we had no choice but to cave to the sweet woman and order a single scoop of gelato. we usually go all out and get 34 scoops in a go. but we truly were still so full from the amazingness that is island flavor, so we settled on 1 lonely scoop of oatmeal cranberry walnut or something to similar effect. the ice cream was definitely very tasty. im guessing id like it more if i wasnt as full. flavorwise, i think my favorite ice cream in vegas is still 346 patisserie, but 1 i plan on trying more gelato at gelatology, and 2 i also intend to get the baked goods at some point. extra points for the wonderfully friendly and inviting service.
firsttime review with the expectation of having the green tea kit kat gelato, except i didnt insert my sad face. i had the lemon cake and the boyfriend had the mocha flavor. mind you, i was a bit upset i didnt call ahead prior to visiting just to make sure they had the green tea kit kat love the actual green tea kit kat!  thats more of my fault. regardless, this is still the best gelato i have ever had! i did feel a bit rushed when trying to figure out what i want and sampling, but the guy behind the counter still helped me out. i will be back for you green tea kit kat gelato!!!
a fantastic addition to the neighborhood! we tried gelatology for the first time last weekend and loved it! looks like a family owned business which is awesome. we were greeted as soon as we walked in and offered samples. the owner said everything is made inhouse and it shows. the strawberry tasted like the fruit and not the flavoring. the chocolate was creamy but not overly sweet. compared to other gelato shops at town square and downtown summerlin, the prices here were much more reasonable. well definitely be adding this place to our dessert rotation!
where do i begin? to tell the story of how great a love can be. or not. emotionally, im torn. this is like rekindling with an old flame and realizing that  it wasnt as good as you remembered. since then youve probably experienced better, met someone new, and fell in love. in my case, it is all of the above. after the tragic break up 6 months ago, i was lost and my heart ached for amazing gelato. fortunately, perfect timing was on my side and that void was filled. somehow, i fell into the arms of a yummy aussie...while i love the kit kat creations, the passion fruit kit kat gelato was good, but lacked in the wafery goodness. only some spoonfuls were loaded with flavor and most others were a bit blah. next visit, i try the creme brulee and same thing happens. i feel that the mixing could be better. there are other sweet goodies in the shop like cookies, macarons, macaroons, a creation called fat elvis and more! welcome back chef desyree! your shop is lovely : ill stay tuned on your instagram: gelatologylv for upcoming flavors. hopefully, one of my favorites will come back.
saw this on yelp and decided to see what the great reviews was all about!! the owner has some pretty clever ideas on different flavors! very unique and yummy!!!
desyree has a very loyal following in the las vegas valley. and for good reason too, she does gelato better than anyone else and her excellence shows in the details. my first experience here was not the best  desyree was not present and the man serving me touched the gelato with his finger while scooping but i still had a sample of it lol. there were also a ton of people behind the counter more so than customers waiting to be served.  i had avoided the place for awhile until the newness kinks were worked out, but of course i was drooling as so many yelpers posted their photos of their delicious treats and then i started following them on ig. i would frequently ask my husband every weeknight when the halo halo was available if we could go, but hed say things like do you really need it? and id say no, and open up my ice cream in the fridge. thankfully, my friend was visiting from out of town and i had a legitimate excuse to go here again! she was intrigued by the pear  gorgonzola based on what i had shared with her, and she ended up getting the gelatology coppe that features it. she loved it and i also thought the savory flavors were intriguing when i sampled hers. i opted for the long craved for halo halo thankfully it was in stock and loved it! ive been complaining that a lot of vegas places do not have beans in their halo halo, and although you cannot see it, the ube and sweet been flavors come through very well. i was also fortunate to try the li hing pineapple gelato first time they were serving it. there was just a small portion left by the end of the night and i felt so lucky to be able to have it! now im craving the li hing flavor for my sour candies. my husband, who is not a big gelato fan, ended up having some of mine and nodding his head in approval as he enjoyed the halo halo. desyree was there this time to take care of us and i thought the experience went so much smoother. they have gelato pies available for this upcoming holiday season, so be sure to reserve one if you want to wow at those office potlucks.
weird how the majority of the first several reviewers have only reviewed this restaurant. anyway, skeptical thoughts aside, this place does the job when you have a curry craving quickly and cheaply. its different from the majority of indian restaurants in that you order up front,  food is quickly made and packaged in styrofoam for ya. open seating area. their regular portions are great for the price! you get a load of rice of your choice pulao or jeera, a side salad, and a good amount of the entree you ordered. satisfies my curry craving, i leave with a happy stomach, and i always have leftovers for the next meal, which is great. dishes start around 8, which i would consider a good price for indian cuisine. ive tried the malai kofta curry w vegetable balls, chicken masala  butter chicken as suggested from reviews with naan. both rich and flavorful. glad this place opened right across the street as i will be back frequently.
they got a couple good vegan options. rice is interesting and tasty. service is good. price is fair.
great food for delivery at a great price. we had the butter chicken a little spicy, garlic naan and mango lassi. all were very good and we will be back soon! not a huge menu but great food! im not too familiar with different indian food so i followed the reviews and was not disappointed!
the skinny: delicious pan fried pork and cabbage dumplings which squirt juice in your mouth! the stirfried dishes we ordered was good as well4 service is excellent! 5 value: pretty good for a fast casual joint. 4.5 stars.fyi, this restaurant is tucked away in the same plaza as the smiths across from inaba. okay. ill be honest. i was a bit skeptical with all the crab rangoon,  moo goo gai pan, sesame chicken on the menu. but i must admit,  underneath it all? this place has some legit chinese food.first of all,  their dumplings are not listed on their regular menu. they have basa fish,  vegetarian, and pork with napa cabbage. you have 3 styles   in soup,  steamed and panfried. all made in house and 8 dumplings will set you back 6.95.the pork and cabbage dumplings pan fried were our starters and boy, are they good! literally the juice from the vegetables and pork squirt into your mouth as you bite into them. the wrapper was not too thick to detract from the filling inside. delicious and tasted just like the ones we make at home. the basa fish dumplings with leeks and ginger we tried were also very good which we tried in soup. the flavor of the soup was okay but the main attraction,  the dumplings,  were pretty flavorful. we tried the braised tofu dish and the steamed eggplant with garlic 8.50 each. the hubs loved the braised tofu. we appreciated the fact the dish had good wok hai and was not overly sauced like most chinese joints. good chinese stirfried dishes should not be sitting in goopy sauce. end of story. the water chestnuts were a bit weird for me but other than that the dish was well constructed and tasted great. i really liked the steamed eggplant dish with garlic. i never thought to just steam it like fish and serve it with soy sauce. it eliminates the amount of oil normally used to cook eggplant and tastes much healthier. the eggplant texture was pillowy soft and fabulous. will have to try this at home. we also received two free smoothies per the yelp check in promotion they have. the hubs got the green tea while i got the black sesame. both were good but really for me the dumplingsfood are the bigger attraction. service was excellent,  friendly and attentive. the restaurant is clean and spacious, making it good for families. fyi, monday to friday, they do have lunch specials featuring chinese american type food for 7.95 and set menus as well. as a more casual restaurant,  they do not have a large extensive menu like other chinese restaurants do. however of what they do have, they execute very well. in reality, the thing that excites me about this place are the more traditional dishes they have here. will definitely be back for more dumplings and to try other dishes. 4.5 starred review.
delicious, divine dumplings with perfect skins, tons of filling, and a great price. at 78piece order, available in three varieties and three cooks panfried, in soup, or steamed, they are easily the highlight here. the basa fish variety with leeks and ginger are subtle but better steamed than in the soup, which i found bland. the pork and cabbage is best panfried to juicy, textured perfection.but dumplings arent all they do well here, the more traditional chinese dishes are also a success. the half roast duck is a generous portion, with a lightly crisped skin and moist, flavorful meat, complemented by a thick, sweet housemade sauce. lighten up your meal with a side of the garlic eggplant or chinese broccoli. will be coming back for garlic spinach, mapa tofu, and chinese seafood gumbo the dumplings are a given.if the food isnt enough to draw you in, this is also a solid place to snag a smoothie or boba: they have 100 options to pick from, and you get a free small on your first visit with yelp check in! the specialty options with multiple fruits sound to be the best, they even feature an avocadoblack sesame version.
we came to try this new restaurant based on reviews by other yelpers and it was not bad. between me and my daughter we had kung pao  chicken lunch special  meh, dry chow fun  good, crab rangoon  pretty good, shrimp potstickers  good, strawberry banana smoothie  good, and lychee black tea  good.  so overall not bad and would come back again, especially for the chow fun since it was very much like what you can get in hong kong.
thanks to yelp i decided to check this little joint out and let me tell you, it was great! the service was exceptional! the waiter was very attentive and even recommended their dumplings to us as one of their most popular dishes. we decided to try them out and they did not disappoint. they came with their signature sauces as well. we also ordered the crab rangoons which were average but nothing too great and the sesame chicken. overall the food was good but the service is really what made this place awesome!
i have to deduct a star after the third visit to the restaurant due to inconsistencies in the cooking of the food.  this was our first time eating dinner here on a somewhat busy night.  it took a moment for the food to arrive but they did check up on us to let us know what was going on, which i appreciated.when the sweet  sour pork came out, instead of that super thin, crispy, light coating, we had large pieces of meat that was thickly coated and some pieces were therefore harder to chew through.  still the flavors were there.  the salt  pepper pork chop usually has a light dusting of the peppers, but this time it looked like mountain of pepper and it was very hard to eat as someone who cannot eat level 10 spiciness.  they did apologize and removed it from our check in the end.i love this place still, and i hope that those kinks are fixed quickly.  we decided to come at lunch time instead of dinner during the weekday when its a bit quieter.  i wont stop eating here, mind you.  ill just watch them improve.
first time trying this place tonight got a order for delivery very fast i order sweet and sour soup amazingggggg, as well with the king pao chicken combo that was okay. didnt care too much for it , it was more on the sweeter side and i like mine more on the spicy side.  but id def order from this place and try something different but will be order that soup again for sure.
do i need a reason to be cheerful? absolutely not. but then comes along a business that makes me want to be more cheerful than i already am, and that place is cheerful house chinese cuisine.what should i cheer on first? how about the hometown team aka the dumpling? ok ill start with that. big, tasty dumplings. ones that make you go mmm mmm mmmm. they make pork ones, fish ones, and shrimpy ones. you know im all about that. and then some. and you get a choice. choices are wonderful. pan fried, steamed, or in soup form. try em all. you know i did. which one is the bestest? thats up for you to decide. im keepin it on the rizzle this time, so ill go pan fried. they got some bubble tea dranks. i liked em, not too sweet for some of em. chewy balls. not too shabby. shabbalicioso. to the max. max payne. in the membrane.other then the dumpleroonies, they serve the usuals that you would normally see in a chinese resto. but i gotta admit, its hella lotta betta than most places. had a ton of fun with the chow fun. it was good enough to make a nun run to the sun. no pun intended. note: the mapo tofu is more soy based here than chili based you would normally find, but hey, it was good so i is are not complaining. you know what i mean, you know what im sayin, kid. like it, good value and portions. fits my palate, thats all i care about. jt says its gonna be maaay, all about them dumplings.
this place is very nice.  i was a little confused about the name, but when i met gary and the staff, i understood!  they are great!  very friendly.  while i was standing at the counter ordering my take out, i noticed the large selection of smoothies on the wall, right behind the counter.  o.m.g., i thought.  thats awesome!  i couldnt help myself.  i had to order a smoothie, blueberrypomegranate, with my meal.  mmmmmm, goood.  great pork dumplings, too!
we ordered the dumblings, the boss man highly recommended it. he said they make them in house. basa fish dumblings  very good i would go back again for themsingapore rice noodles  decentsalt and pepper squid  this dish is why they didnt get 5 starssmoothies  boss man said only real fruit, i think hes right
i enjoyed their food, cleanliness and modern menu. the staff are very friendly and helpful with menu suggestions. they have lunch specials for 7.95 from 114pm. food was yummy. loved the salt and pepper shrimp shell off with a bit of smile. it was so crispy!
my first time eating here, and all i can say is it a fantastic place. the entrees are delicious, the hosts friendly and attentive. the boba is the best ! the super large sized boba is 4.95 which is phenomenal. definitely trying this place again, and eating my favorite bbq pork chops :
order it for the second time this week. definitely satisfy my chinese craving that i must have more! everything is extremely tasty! when i ordered the seafood pan fried noodles, i was expecting ...some shrimp but as soon as i opened that box, kapow!an assortment of seafood in every bite! the crab ragoons are an addiction.they did forget my cookie ...but i will forgive them, this time!
fantastic. just drove into town and wanted something away from the casinos. kung pao chicken was perfect with steamed rice. also had a strawberry smoothie.
i ordered the duck which is a must for this restaurant. the skin is really crispy and the sauce is sweet.
tres interessant comme concept. un espace collaboratif paye a lheure pour travailler, avec cafe fait sur place. super sympathique le service, qui nous expliquent avec joie comment fonctionne leur petite place. meme leur nom de reseau et leur mot de passe wifi est marrant : peut etre bruyant part moments mais il y a une petite salle au fond pour sisoler au besoin.
cute cafe to grab a coffee to sit  people watch.stopped in after grabbing some fairmont bagels and doing a little shopping.  we were in search of some wifi and gab was perfect for quenching our thirsts and resting our feet :pretty spacious inside with plenty of space to set up your laptop and grab a drink  snack.  they didnt have any chilled bottled waters but the service was good. this place is located on a busy part of saint laurent and there were many patrons but did not feel crowded.  i really liked this place!
the people here are so welcoming! simple street tacos and a salsa bar with good homemade food. tempe has been needing some street taco action and this is a perfect location. cant wait to try a burrito!
good carne asada tacos! the beans and rice was not great beans were cold and just not good, but the tacos were excellent and the salsa was good and hot!
thankfully they put some signs on the street next to the strip mall, which kept teasing a spot in my subconscious directly linked to street taco nirvana. this place was either going to hit the mark or be a one and done. well, it hit the mark. the smoked and marinated meats are works of art. the fresh salsas are generally very good  the smoky salsa is the best choice. everything is made to order, including the guacamole which we decided was necessary to tide us over until we could make decisions on the deep menu. the waitress reminded us it was made by hand upon order, so we would have to wait a bit for it. 2 minutes later it was at our table. omg  delicious. we are now trying to figure out how to direct all our neighbors over here so it gets successfully launched. and we are going to see if they will let us order up a few pounds of meat for a party at our house. oh wait, i missed one fine detail  byob!! awesome place
newer spot in tempe serving great mexican food. they are smoking their own meats in the back, are byob, and will start to sell meats by the pound here in the near future. the food is really good, the salsa bar lets you kick up the spices to your liking and the staff is friendly. definitely give it a try if you are in the neighborhood.
this is my first review. i have used yelp for a couple of years to find good food but never have taken the time to leave a review. the tacos are so yummy! beans and rice were good but those are just filler!  my friend, who travels to mexico on a regular basis, said the tacos tasted very authentic. i got the 3 taco plate bistec, al pastor, and barbacoa. my favorite was the al pastor but all 3 were tender and delicious. i was sad to see that it wasnt busy at lunch. this place is worth trying! i give 4 stars instead of 5 because the sign says that the chips are made fresh to order but when they arrived, they were not hot or even warm. i could tell they were homemade but not fresh to order. my only other critique is location. tucked back in a strip mall, it is difficult to find.
staff: friendly and quirky. you can tell they care a lot about the food and check in several times to make sure everything is up to par. might be overbearing for some food enjoyers. they are a few months in and are working to develop their brand. food: salsas are homemade and you get various options a la carte and free. spanish rice was flavorful but a tad too fluffy and overcooked. i dont think the rice was extra long grain which is what i believe most mexican dishes use . meat options were plentiful and tasty. id say their meat is the strongest item in terms of flavor on the menu. drinks: they do have horchata but its in a big glass server and not machine so its not getting consistently stirred and the alcohol is literally byob theres a liquor store right next door. kinda fun and they have ice buckets and frozen glasses for you.i would definitely come back in. this is the type of restaurant that seems to go the extra mile to get to know you and find out how they can continue developing their food!
walking into tc tacos i was immediately excited by the discovery of what all yelpers hold dear, the wholeinthewall. on arrival, i was greeted by eddie, who was very welcoming and suggested that we explore their chicken tacos. receiving the food, i would say i was satisfied but not ecstatic. with that said, they have a modest yet delicious salsa bar.
ive been here twice in the past week, so you know the food has to be pretty good!  first time i went, i got the steak burrito dinner.  it came with a burrito, rice, and beans for about 9.  not a bad deal... except when you realize that the burrito alone is only about 6... and the rice and beans they serve in the dinner are not that greattasting.  the rice especially was not my favorite.  so second time i went, i just ordered the al pastor burrito alone.  out of the two meats i tried, i think i prefer the steak to the pork.i really like the smokey spicy salsa in their salsa bar.  its not that hot, but it adds nice flavor to the burritos.i overheard them saying that they got their recipes from mexico city, so i guess theyre pretty authentic to true street tacos!this place is great, although ill try to limit my visits in the future since the food isnt really all that healthy for you :p
food was great. the pork tacos were delicious and full of smokey flavors. the smoked medium salsa was awesome and the hot hot salsa had a great taste and wasnt just plain hot. dont let this place fool you because its small its a must try!
my moms obsessed w this place and eats it all the time. today i tried their steak fajitas. it came w red and yellow sliced bell pepper, white onion, spanish rice and pinto beansmelted white cheese on top on the side. it was very good along w their guacamole. only thing i didnt really like was their dark green salsa. it was a darker hotter salsa ive never tasted before. idk if it spilled but it seems like thats what they put on the steak and it was just a little much. next time ill ask for it wo.
its not everyday that you encounter a restaurant that has their own butcher! you can taste the quality and care the chef places in each meat that is cooked. there is a smoker on premises and a flame broiler for the meats. we came in and i ordered the chorizo and egg burrito with a horchata. the chorizo is very flavorful and made inhouse. it was a huge burrito and every bite had a good balance of meat to egg. my husband had the chorizo breakfast platter which was a hearty portion that he enjoyed. the horchata was decent, but too sweet for me. there is a great salsa bar with various salsas, limes, and pickled jalapenos. its covered as well which i appreciate since it keeps things more hygienic.the only real negative was that there isnt a soda fountain so all drinks are by the bottle or in a large glass container for aguas frescas. the sodas are only jarritos brand, which i believe has no diet soda option. overall though, ill definitely come here again for more tasty and quick options for mexican food.
this is a byob restaurant and its great, there is a little liquor store right next door to go pick out your drinks while they make your great meal. the chips and guacamole are a must, very flavorful. the salsa bar is the best so many great optionsi had the chile relleno which were very good. the flavor and heat were great.  my friend had the shrimp burrito and burn jalapeno. both looked amazing and tasted the same. i really enjoyed this place, the food was great, the people were amazing and the atmosphere was like you were getting a home made meal.
clean, warm atmosphere. i had the carne asada tacos with rice and beans, very yummy! they also have a salsa bar with a variety of salsas, i loved the salsa de chile de arbol, it has a nice kick. they also had food network playing on a flat screen tv that i watched while waiting for my take out order.
we went here for the first time today for lunch. service was really good and food came out so fast! we ordered items with barbacoa meat and they were delicious, the only thing we didnt really like was the smoked chicken it had no flavor. the beans and rice were really good as well! we will definitely go back!
the barbacoa street tacos are good and they seem to use fresh ingredients. the service was great, very friendly and laidback. i only wish the hot salsa was more spicy.
definitely worth stopping in.  excellent flavor on all the tacos.  i also had the guac and chips which was tasty.  ill be back when im in the neighborhood!
hooray!luncha libre have gone brick and mortar....and theyre in my hood! they were my first official postscotland hangover meal this morning after i was rechristented at the swizz and bar one last night.youll find the same menu as their food truck, so i can now have my steak and bleu dilla, with a side of chips and salsa, whenever i want!!! they also serve street tacos and luncharitas, and fresh churros for postre. they also have a small cooler with mexican coke and fanta!!!! yup, fanta!!!! orange and grape flavor!!!!!!theyre starting smart with a tiny but cheerful spot with two tables, some counter space and a few sidewalk tables. very cheerful place, with the same great yummy menu weve all come to love. worth checking out!
lots of choices, and fresh ingredients
i stopped in for lunch on saturday and had a great experience.  the couple that owns the place is very friendly, the food was fantastic and i love the luncharitas fresh juice served in a jar.  the citrus berry was absolutely delicious...i am seriously going to crave this stuff every day!  the chicken dilla was quite tasty  the salsa was legit too!
weird to see a food truck turn its concept into a brick and mortar store but given its location to me, there are no complaints!went in the other day for the first time my girlfriend has had their food from the truck before but neither of us have had food from the store after seeing the carne asada fries on their instagram.  we split an order of those as well as a carne quesadilla, and had a coupon for a free luncharita which do not have alcohol in them, which mildly surprised me.  the guy behind the counter couldnt have been nicer! he gave us samples of the flavors for our luncharita and when we went to add on some chips to our order after having paid, he told us not to worry about it.the carne fries were, just, amazing.  the only thing i would mention is that the liquid cheese was a little overpoweringoverdone but the fries were perfect, carne was tasty, and they also put some siracha on top. a full to go box full for 10, reminded me a lot of carne asada fries from tacos el gordo in las vegas in terms of portion size.  two grown adults werent able to take this down in one sitting but it was just as tasty the next day reheated!the quesadilla was just as tasty with gobs of cheese, though a little smaller than i would have thought given the price, it also comes with chips.they have a good selections of salsa and the mason jar you get with the luncharita is yours to keep and bring back for 3 refills.overall our meal for the two of us, was 19 take in to account we had a coupon for the drink and were given a free order of chips which are normally two bucks which is pretty darn good for the quality youre getting.im sure we will be back!
prices are a little too much for me, but the food flavors are definitely worth it.  ive enjoyed their food truckside, but this location is nice since its close to work!  ive had their lengua tacos which was done very softly since tongue can be very tough meat to cook, had their chicken papas verde and the thai chicken quesadilla.  all the food has been awesome and so delicious.  the guavastrawberry rita is my favorite and ive tried and have been unsuccessful at replicating it at home :  oh well, guess ill have to stop by here to get my luncha fix.  chips are crunch and just the right amount of salt, and the salsa although not spicy, is still very tasty.
i am traveling from the east coast and growing up in la, i really miss authentic mexican food when i am there! the closest i can get to mexican food on the east coast is chipotle.i asked the person working there for recommendations and he suggested the all thaid up quesadilla but i was craving tacos so i ordered the lengua beef tongue, carnitas shredded pork, and carne arrachera skirt steak. my favorite was the skirt steak! i liked my tacos with chunks of meat. it was very flavorful! i also like the beef tongue :p that is one of my favorite cut of meat! but because this is stewed, it loses some of the texture that i like in the beef tongue. but the avocado slice in the taco was a nice touch. 3 tacos came out to be 9.50 and comes with side of chips and salsa. i love the art inside this restaurant and i am happy to say my mexican craving was satisfied!
first time here: we ordered  the cheese fries with pico and carne asada on it  the fries are awesome and i wish there were more  it had quite a bit of cheese on it and i would probably ask for 12 cheese next time  the beef was outstanding! we also had carne and chicken tacos which were very good  a bit on the salty side but very good. the steak  bleu quesadilla was a hit  massive and tons of meat and cheese! the chips and salsa that came with it were excellent and the salsa was excellent! oh i had the unsweetened jasmine tea which came in a huge glass mason jar with a lid! great place and definitely going back.
tried the carne asada fries and god damn they were good !!the staff was super friendly, all around it was a great experience.
excellent petit dejeuner! bonne portion. et contrairement a son voisin de brunch, le cafe est inclus!
hubs and i first noticed this place when they had their coming soon banner up. weve been desperate in finding a vietnamese restaurant we could call our spot pho dau bo and ben thanh just isnt cutting it for us. so on our routine costco trips for the last few months weve been keeping an eye out for when they open, and low and behold their coming soon banner has now changed to a grand opening banner! complete with 15 off until the end of june woot!the wait for our new spot was worth it not just because of the sweet grand opening discount but also because of the delicious food and genuine service. weve been twice in the last week theyve been open. try the egg rolls, vermicelli bowls, and pho. the egg rolls arent your typical freezer eggrolls.. the wrapper has that perfect fried texture goodness complete with a melt in your mouth tasty filling. egg rolls are a tough sell for me because i usually feel indifferent about them but i definitely enjoy these babies. i ordered the grilled pork and eggroll vermicelli bowl yummy grilled pork atop fresh and delicate vermicelli with crunchy bean sprouts, carrots, lettuce and cucumber served with that magic sauce you just pour all over.. fire. sos pho was so aromatic and comforting. the owner of the restaurant introduced himself during our meal and the servers are all attentive and friendly. well definitely be back.
12:30pm, friday, july 17, 2015:i ordered a shrimp and pork salad roll on this restaurants menu they call it a shrimp and pork spring roll though that term normally is used for the fried rolls. this was 4.50 and it came with two rolls. it was good. i enjoyed it. it came with real peanut sauce instead of just straight hoisin sauce.i also ordered a wonton soup, for 5.75 for a small bowl i think. delicious!! it had sauteed onions and ginger in the soup. the broth sure tasted like home made chicken broth, whether it is 100 homemade or not. the soup was flavorful and aromatic! i savoured every spoonful of this light and tummywarming soup! it was great on a rainy day like today.i only tried those two dishes on this visit and enjoyed it. the one thing about the wonderful wonton soup was that it didnt come with noodles. maybe you can have it with noodles and i didnt know to ask or whatnot. either way, the 6 wontons in a delicious broth with chinese cabbage i think thats the vegetable and sauteed onions and ginger were tasty.the restaurant looked clean. the washroom looked clean which isnt always the case in asian restaurants with good authentic food.its my first time at this vietnamese restaurant. i would come again based on this firsttime experience.
first time in to pho bistro.  as i entered, i was greeted by a gentleman who may be the owner, from across the room.  he directed me to a booth against the wall by pointing to the seat.  soon after, i was brought a menu and a pot of hot tea, not something i am used to.  im not much of a fan of hot beverages, but the tea was good, not strong in flavor but good nonetheless.after reviewing the menu, i had my selections in mind and waited for someone to take my order.  the ordering style is a little different, a server doesnt take your order.  you have to write your order on the order slip and the server will take it to the kitchen.  i ordered strawberry bubble tea,  pork and shrimp spring rolls, and a seafood stirfry.as i wait for the order to arrive, i realize how loud the place is, with no sounddampeners, sounds reverberate throughout the establishment.  the bubble tea machine is especially loud, but the product was scrumptious, reminding me of a strawberry milk as it seems to be made with ice cream.  the spring rolls came out and were underwhelming.  they were good, but i think could have used a little more meat.  i didnt taste much of the pork, but the dipping saucecontains peanuts made them extra tasty.  the stirfry came out of the kitchen steaming hot, and smelling delicious.  the vegetables tasted as if they were fresh and steamed to perfection.  there was a greater variety of seafood within the meal; quantity of each is not high, but the variety is good including shrimp, clams, squid, crab meat and a few others.  the noodles were nothing impressive, but the brothsauce made up for the lack of flavor.overall, i would say it was a good experience.  the restaurant has a new feel and appears clean; even the washroom was clean.  this place offers a takeout menu.  you have to go to the counter to pay and only accepts visa and mastercard credit cards.  ultimately, i think i will come back so i can explore the menu further.  first time in pho bistro...but not the last.
i found this place through yelp, while staying in kitchener for business. i really didnt feel like eating fast food or pub food which is what you can find a ton of in the immediate area. so i decided to give this place a try. am i ever glad i did!  its a nice, clean place with friendly service. the interior had modern, fresh decor. i was greeted immediately upon entering. i told them i just wanted to order some takeout, and they seated me at a table with a nice cup of tea while i peruse the menu and waited for my order. it was 8pm but there were many patrons in the restaurant.  pho seemed to be the popular dish ordered. on that day, i had the fresh shrimp rolls and rice plate with kalbi beef.  the shrimp rolls were so fresh and huge! i really could have just had those as a meal all by itself!  the rice and kalbi beef was very good. lots of meat, well seasoned and very tender. it also had a small salad on the side and good amount of the dipping sauce as well. i was really happy with this meal.  so happy in fact that i went back to pho bistro again for dinner the next day!the host recognized me and thanked me for coming again. on day two, i had the fried spring rolls and rice plate with chicken and egg.  the fried spring rolls were good.  they were also huge, but nothing to write home about. the chicken was good as well. huge piece...i couldnt finish it. allinall, im really glad i was able to find this place. ill definitely be back when returning to the area.
first time through the wash since it opened. good job and love the free vacuum service at the end!
this place is a great alternative to a full service car wash. clean, new and uncrowded. yes i said uncrowded. : but be aware the 3 advertised rate is express only. their standard washes start at 6.
third time using this automatic car wash today, first time with the membership. does an excellent job cleaning my altima, and much faster than other washes with zero spots. would give it a fifth star if it was open before 7:00 to grab a quick wash before my busy day starts! especially with monsoons in eveningovernight, many clean freaks would like to drive a clean car all day, but have to leave for work before 7:00. maybe just make the membership lane available an extra hour in the morning when the staff arrive to prep for the day?! please, please, please?
it does the trick. im here at least once a week. my only complaint is the employees want me to pull in directly behind a vehicle and im so close it makes me nervous that im going to hit the car ahead of me or get rearended. i wish theyd give more space.
caramel macchiato. 3.84. super yummy. its open area from the korean supermarket so expect a lot of noise. dont come thinking its a full on shop bc the opening to the market. service was friendly and fast
i am a bit dissapointed to read some negative reviews written recently for upfitters. i dont know any of the specifics to anyone elses reviews but i will give them a solid 4 stars for the work they did for me. paul and crew installed a 7ft custom commercial vent hood in a food trailer i had just pruchased out of state. i told paul what i wanted and he said no problem we can have it ready in 2 weeks. he had the courtesey to call me and let me know they were running behind on their schdule and asked if it would be ok to deliver the trailer back to me a few days late. well he kept his promise, i picked up the trailer a few days after the original due date and the vent hood is great. i have since put it into production and have no complaints what so ever. the hood is beautiful, custom fit, and works as it should. thank you paul and nick for a job well done!ramiro gonzalez raytacos el velvet elvistucson, az.
new location but same awesome food. location seems small in comparison to past location at collenade mall.my favorite is the pastrami on onion roll which the pastrami is top notch and the onion roll is fresh and soft.have been eating at miracle mile since it was at park central and christown mall, prices have gone up but during busy lunch time they get you thru the line quickly. this new location seems alot smaller than the previous one at collenade mall and certainly less parking. the same staff is there to help out and serve you the best deli food in phoenix. will certainly be back again for lunch and will most likely order the pastrami on onion roll with french fries and a pickle. pastrami sandwich comes with french fries and of course a pickle.
i appreciate the quality of the food here but i am not at all a fan of the experience.  herded through a cafeteria line where they dish out food like im in grade school simply doesnt do it for me.  that alone would have me giving them 4 stars but when you consider that they are a little pricey.... that gives you 3 stars.  maybe i am not cool enough to get it.ok i beyond laughed at the response to my review.  well played!  i love a place that doesnt take themselves too serious and can have a little fun.  im giving you a star back because you made me laugh days after my meal.
i stopped in for lunch this past weekend at the new location and this place was packed!  the service was very quick and friendly, the atmosphere was nice and the menu selection was vast.  i decided on the mac  cheese with a side of steamed veggies  all in all really good quality and a reasonable price for what you get.
it had been 5 years since  i have been in one of the restaurants.  they now serve breakfast from 7.00 am to 11.00 . the price for breakfast  seems reasonable  . i came by at 11.05 and they were not ready for lunch . i had to wait for 12 minutes  before i could order a sandwich to go . prices were about 20 higher.  but portions were large and the pastrami  very very good . the place is smaller  but much cleaner . the menu has quite a few desserts.
warning: this place will give you a guaranteed food coma.this place is a deli styled restaurant where you order and get your food at the register and self seat. the place is pretty big and has a lot of open seating. i ordered the matzo ball soup and ruben sandwich. now let me tell you, that sandwich is massive. it comes with a side and a pickle. i ordered fries which were nicely cooked. the sandwich was delicious. the meat was tender and i had a very happy stomach. it was my first time having a matzo ball soup and i thought it was okay. it didnt have too much flavor and was a little bland which was fine because everything else was so heavy. i probably would come again if i was craving some deli food.
so i went back to retry the matzah ball soup and reuben sans congestion no congestion.the matzah ball soup was tasting like it came from a powder, faint but still there. that salty, gritty, not quite flavorful taste of homemade chicken soup broth. the soup was missing g the dense was of a homemade soup that usually tastes of bone marrow or gelatin in the case of  chicken soup depending on the amount chicken bones and vegetables placed in the broth. the matzah ball was tasting kinda like glue or having been in a unflavored soup. there was not taste other than the flour sitting in the waterbroth. no spices like pepper or even salt or even chicken fat.the reuben was well done and consistent in its outcome.  the sauerkraut was crunchy and tangy though could have used some sort of a spice. the thousand island was freaks and the cheese was melted but there was some shredded ? cheese on my sandwich. the corned beef tasted pretty good but might have been sitting for too long could not tell. but tasty nothing the less. the rye bread was soggyish on one did but toasted on both. not sure what happened.again the staff was helpful in telling me what the fries were fried in.
funny story how i ended up going to odelay bagel company. i was at a local irish bar last night and met the owner though and found out he had started up this place only a few months ago. he noted that he had to be up and making bagels at 2 am bakers hours indeed!. i promised i would come by this morning and check it out. well, im glad i did, he has a lovely establishment and a great selection of freshly made bagels. i bought both the black pepper parmesan and the jalapeno cheddar bagels and also the bacon and horseradish and the italian herbs and chives smear. i also had a chance to say high to the owner again who had indeed, been up early, making all the bagels in the bagel bins. the bagel type he makes reminds me of noahs bagels that ive had in los angeles, being more of the lighter style of bagel versus the extremely chewy new york style of bagel. the nice thing, certainly makes them easier to slice when you get home though you can get them toasted and smeared at the establishment.i noticed that you can also get your bagel with lox sorry, not a huge fan of the smoked fish on a bagel but i know many people love it and the establishment also makes a nice array of coffee based drinks the store has an espresso machine and teas, and they have fresh brewed iced tea.i will say i certainly look forward to going back and trying some of the other bagels and its nice to see someone successfully starting and running his own business who obviously knows what hes doing.   oh, when you drive up, the signage above the story says bagels  coffee  the name of the business is on the glass window so you know, that is the place. my only request, think about a peppercorn potato bagel  its my favorite one at noahs in california. looking forward to my next visit and hearing more of the owners story about how he got into the bagel business  i only heard a bit of it at the irish bar but it sounds fascinating.p.s.  he also employees extremely nice and wellmannered kids from the local high school so when you support this place, you not only get some great bagels and coffee but you support a local business that provides work opportunities for young people in the community, so a winwin all the way around.;
very good bagels.  great selection of cream cheeses.  i had the baconhorseradish which was good.  the menu is very limited but if youre in the mood for a bagel and coffee, youre in luck.  the bagel and lox was priced well and delicious.  it was 6.50 i believe.  an individual bagel will run you about 2.50 with cream cheese.  there are numerous coffeetea selections.  the coffee is really good but priced a bit high.  im happy to have this option for a quick breakfast in ahwatukee and look forward to going back.
stopped in the new location on their opening day and already i love it.  the pastries and sandwiches are just as delicious as the original location in noda, but much closer to my house.  its a huge space when you walk in, with the counter displaying the offerings in the back.  if youve been to the noda location, the case and set up of the case looks exactly like the original.  there were some pleasant surprises at this location.  over to the right of the pastry counter in the far corner is a winecoffee bar.  they have beer and wine for sale as well as a variety of coffee drinks.  we bought our pastry and espresso at the counter then went over to the coffee bar and waited for our drinks. we sat down at the bar and ate our pastry and drank our espresso.  it was a wonderfully relaxing time.  we most definitely will be back to sit on the outdoor patio and to get some wine at the wine bar.
good food as always but holy cow, a 45 minute wait in line for a decent sandwich is ridiculous. seriously amelies, open up a few more registers, ask your cashiers to work more quickly, or find a way to more efficiently take people through the line. we brought a decent sized group and there were a lot of mistakes and very late food. will never compare to the original! definitely glad for a more accessible location though and absolutely worth going. just dont go during peak hours if youre in a hurry. also smells a lot like paint.
my coworker told me that amelie is opened in pineville matthew. i am so glad they open one in pineville because i can go there after work.when i went it was busy but the service was fast. they have the best pastries but is it pricey. i got four pastries for my family and i. i got the chocolate puffs, salted carmel brownie, and chocolate cake. the chocolate puffs were so good. you got to try the chocolate puffs. amelie, you got to open one in vegas. vegas is waiting for you.
just ate at amelies french bakery.  my wife and i loved it!  the interior was open and had a nice feel to it.  overall, the whole place a cool vibe  also, great eclairs!  i experienced no hiccups in service or food and this was only the second week they have been open.  the place was busy for lunch  but food and service flowed nicely!great job, amelies!
i love that there is a new location in carmel commons. i have to admit that i love the noda one a tad bit more than this one but at least i can go and get these goodies when im on the other side of charlotte without having to plan a cross country trip across the state of mecklenburg. the treats are just amazing and the staff is wonderful.
nice place. quiet. might be because it is a bit new. the pate sandwich is awesome in its simplicity. the cappuccino are well executed. so many pastries too.
updating the initial review. i did return to this location with my family last weekend.  definitely a totally different experience.  kept things simple on the beverage side: 2 hot chocolates for the kids, my wife had hot tea and i had a french press coffee. we all ordered twice baked croissants and we all really enjoyed.  the service was very good and we had a question once seated for a staff member.  it was her first day and she had an awesome personality...very pleasant.  she explained she was new but she would do her best to help us cant remember her question. as a local business owner, i would hope my employees represent my company in a similar fashion.  most importantly, as a response to my first review, i received a note from stefanie who expressed regret for my experience and offered to buy me a croissant and coffee.  unexpected but the way a complaint should be handled.  thanks stefanie! i responded back, but not sure you received as i was having technology issues that day!
soooo happy this location is open close to my office. driving to noda was just too dang far for me. but now i can have eclairs whenever i want! wait, maybe this is a bad thing for my wallet and waistline. the only negative is the ordering process, which seems a little disorderly and confusing. i was waiting in line for the pastry case, but others wanted to order sandwiches and after waiting in the line, they were told they had to order prepared foods at the register. there should be better signage for the different ordering stations, rather than waiting in a ridiculously long line only to be told they could have skipped that and gone directly to the register.
having been to the original location a bunch and seeing how the uptown location was designed, i think they did a good job setting up this spot. very open and the layout is more conducive to having an actual line vs how the original shop is set up. i like the fact that theres an outside patio as well.the two things i could see them improving on is maybe adding another register if they do have a rush and adding some more areas to put your leftover plates. besides that, i can see this place being a welcome addition to the south side of the city.
came in on a week day right before lunch. walked right up and ordered immediately. the sea salted carmel brownie is the bomb!! i dont even want to know what they put in that thing of awesome. cant wait to get back and take out of town friends.
monkey bread was delicious!  hot chocolate was creamy and yummy. fairly busy for midafternoon on a saturday. casual and comfortable.
very casual and relaxing place to eat. they have the best salted caramel brownies i have ever had.
its very spacious compared to the one in downtown which i really like! the pastries were amazing still however it just seemed like the people working were really slow or confused. there is also an outside patio which is nice to sit at even in this humid weather. the area seems to be kept cool by the fan so its nice to be able to sit outside and relax.
much need for thoughs sweet craving after dark. no other place in south charlotte to go so even though its aint the same as the one in uptown it any bad.
what can i say...delicious!!  the famous salted caramel treat is awesome!!  the croissants are fabulous.  i love the vibe of this place..the decor is appealing to the eye...plenty of places to chill and relax...definitely worth a visit.
nice atmosphere. staff was friendly and helpful and patient! i came for lunch one day and got the chicken salad with the croissant. it was good and flaky. i have also been for just dessert. i can take about two or three bites and be done with my dessert because they are so sweet. i love the decor and im glad they opened in this area.
this place is so cute!! restaurant is larger than the other one. staff helped with all my questions. everything was so pretty it was hard to decide. i got the chicken salad croissant and it was good. chicken salad is mayo based and had large chunks of meat. croissant was flaky and fluffy at the same time.
theres only one other review and its pretty negative without much substance so here goes. this place is as good as any other nail salon around. its not a luxury place, its owned and operated by people who dont native speak english and who are likely talking about you behind your back but that is true of 90 of the nail places in town. they do a fine job and their prices are reasonable and theyre clean. so while its not awesome, its definitely above average.
flight 23 still has that new car smell, with its grand opening taking place just a little over a month ago april 24, 2015.this vegas location at the miracle mile shops is footactions second jordanonly retail store in the world, with the first location in nyc feb 2014 and the future chicago flagship still under construction. similar to foot lockers house of hoops, footactions flight 23 expectedly has a display of classic jordan memorabilia and a wide assortment of jbranded merch, from footwear to apparel and accessories.vegas sneakerheads were treated to an early release of the aj7 hares 3 weeks ahead of the general release during the grand opening. the first lucky 100 in line received a pack of limited hare commemorative pins in honor of jordans 30th anniversary x looney toons collab some camped as early as 6pm the day before. impressively, this is also the only store in all of vegas that received the pinnacle 1s this past may 2, so its safe to expect more exclusive drops on the hottest quick strikes. cant wait to see what other rare releases come this way!
airy and colorful space to chill or be chilled. love those fries!
their signature burger which we got with the chipotle black bean patty rivaled any burger ive had around the area. the seared tuna with wasabi peas also had a great texture contrast. i will definitely be a regular when im downtown!
great atmosphere, wide beer selection. order the crack fries and wings, skip the mussels.
was there late afternoon on saturday....place was busy...its new and a street fair was going on.  staff was friendly...our bartender jesse was young, smart, excited about the place and cute.  she knew her beer styles and talked about the beer education the servers have been getting and what new things shes learned.  i love a place that edecates their staff...not just tells them what to push.   crowd was a mix of everyone.....young adults, a few families...and some of 30 and overs.it took us longer to choose our first beers than to get them.  we ended up having mac cheese with add ins.  sloppy joe meat for one sliced polish sausage the other.  both were good...i wont say the best ive ever had...but solid.  the food came out hot and quickly.i heard that the music was too loud...but it wasnt while we were there.  prices are not cheap...but not completely outrageous for the sort of place it is and where its at.   they know they already have the rep for not taking fake ids from the college crowd...and they like it that way....but one bartender said that management has emphasized letting them know of issues first...so maybe the  idiot bouncer will be a one off thing. we will be back soon and bring friends with us.  hope they keep up this level of service and enthusiasm.
love the crack fries, had the load ones also. new place  here ftom indiana came out to see some friends he has the free fries for a year card.
i finally made it over to hopcat, some 3weeks after it first opened.  wow. what a beautiful facility.  every surface, from the bar to the dining area to the restroom has been carefully thought out and addressed. its really a cool space, with quality construction and perfectly placed kitsch and whatnot. a ton of bar stools; huge wraparound bar bar stools are wide and comfy hooks under the bar! yay! massive tap beer list proper stemware used for each beer a bunch of belgians, strongs, soursi realize theyre the rage right now, but im not a huge fan good mix of domestic micros and international brews i like the coming soon list that highlights whats waiting in the cooler pricing for pintsglasses is reasonable; didnt price pitchers bar staff was super friendly and helpful. very cool. bartenders were knowledgable, walked us through options, made some suggestions, and utilized feedback from a few sipstasters to help us get perfect brews for the day. super great!ill be back. great place  i hope it does well here!
hop cat has tons of different beers on tap, some local the local 30 and others from all over the world. the burger i had, and the salad my friend had, were both good, as were the beers we got. their crack fries really are quite addicting. the problem with hop cat is that its definitely more expensive than pretty much every similar place in madison. if you go to hop cat, dont get a beer that you could get somewhere else in madison. also, they dont allow people under 21 in the restaurant unless accompanied by a parent at all times of the day.
can you go wrong with 130 taps?  probably not.  they have a list of 30 locals and the remaining 100 are a variety from around the world, even including a section with gluten free and kombucha options.  taps change frequently, as two new ones came on board during our dinner there.  i like that you can order smaller volumes.  some of the belgians are a little pricier than other establishments.after reading other reviews, i was terrified that my legitimate outofstate id would be confiscated, but it was not.the bartenders are friendly, but i think the service is inefficient as it takes a while to get a beer.  the food arrives quickly, but getting the food order in takes a long time.  also, i ordered the poutine without onions it was delicious! but it still came covered in scallions.  the menu said the poutine came with caramelized onions but not scallions.  i would suggest including scallions in the menu description if the item comes covered in them.  onionhaters will be thankful.the atmosphere is very... nontraditional.  the side walls are covered in very colorful graffititype painting.  there are many tvs.hopefully they get out their we just opened jitters and the service at the bar is faster in the future.
first time here.  we came for beer and appetizers.  we got the pizza rolls and pretzel  nuggs.  the pizza rolls were okay but not great.  the pretzels were good.  i really like the cheese sauce. the beer list was extensive but did not contain the one beer my husband wanted  lagunitas sumpin sumpin.
this place impressed me.  was here on a very busy weekend and found the service to be good, enjoyed the food, and wow the beer selection.ok first the beer.  they had 100 on tap, and some fantastic craft choices as well.  this was a reason enough for the beer geek to come on in.i tried one of the burgers and ordered medium and was happy when it actually came out medium dont see that often in bar  grills.  their crack frys are quite good as well.the building is big, clean, and modern.  i saw an upstairs as well, but didnt go check it out.  the main area has ample bar seating and several tables with tvs strewn through out.ill be back next time.
my better half and i stopped in and a sunday night and left impressed.  130 beers to choose from can be a daunting task but the menu has them grouped in styles for easier selection.  we were also very fortunate to have an excellent server that definitely had a passion for good beer and offered some wonderful suggestions.we started out the night with an order of the oftmentioned crack fries.  honestly, we werent  blown away.  perhaps our expectations were too high as we thought they were good but not something we would always order.  on the addicting scale, they are more chocolate or sugar than crack.for my entree, i went with i am the pork who knocks sandwich.  interesting name but what is more interesting are the ingredients.  beerbattered, pretzelencrusted pork tenderloin topped with swiss cheese, blue cheese  apple cider bbq slaw, lettuce, tomato  haystack onions. it seriously is gigantic and i ate it all.  if you are not a savage like myself, this could easily be shared between two people.  the tenderloin was crunchy and moist and the blue cheesecider slaw paired nicely with it.  service, as mentioned above, was great.  the space is huge and it will be interesting to see the clientele it draws.  while its situated on campus, my prediction is that it will continue to draw young professionals and the like.  i will definitely be back.
not bad. large open area and large walk around bar.  acoustics are pretty good. good happy hour prices to get you in the door and then good prices after 10pm. these 2 things will keep the college crowd coming in the door and the money rolling in too.  all of the staff are college kids which means they will probably have lots of turnover.  i wish you could sub out their fries with a sandwich for greens, but there is an extra charge for a side salad and you still get their fries most places downtown offer greens or fries as an option.   many of their burgers are like aj bombers which are how many things can we toss on top of a burger with one exception, hopcat burgers are 12 lbs and ajs are 110 lbs.  i plan to stop back soon after 10pm for a 3 dollar beer and snack ...
its hard to give hopcat a fair review without eating the entrees, but the beer selection was everything they advertise and more! 130 beers on tap and something for every taste! they even had my favorite  louis demise which previously ive only found in milwaukee! we shared the crack fries as an appetizer and they were delicious. atmosphere was very relaxed and service was great despite being very busy. we definitely will be back to try the entrees!
holy beer bar!  so many to choose from, many with witty names and from local breweries.  i stuck with belgian ales  creamy and delicious.  food here is pretty darn good  lots of variety and tasty as heck.
this is a beautiful place to get your beer drinking on!  the food is good but really the main reason to come is for the experience.  there are new and interesting brews on the expansive and rotating menu.  i know i will be back in the new future.
great selection of beers on tap.  i would suggest coming here during happy hour for half price off beer and burgers.  honestly, the crack fries are nothing spectacular, but they seem to market them like theyre the best thing in the world.  the servers seem to know nothing about any of the beers they have on tap, but the bartenders seem pretty knowledgeable.  if youre sitting on the first floor, its not really a great place to watch sports because the tvs are far away.  the second floor is much better.
ah! madison needed a place like this! a beer lovers paradise! this may be my new haunt. so. many. tappers! they are also great at repping the local microbreweries! the variety is also great and they of course have mini glasses... so its basically an endless, build your own flight if you wish.crack fries were yummy but im not sure i was a ga ga for them as everyone else. dont get me wrong, they are mighty tasty, peppery with a hint of sweetness and a delish cheese sauce for dipping; but with a reputation like that, i expected them to blow my mind.my mussles however... the best i have ever had! you get a ton! seriously, they are not shy about the portion. the sauce is made of spicy chorizo, a light tomato broth, onions and a sprinkle of heaven.  served with buttery bread. mmmm! my husband got their fish and chips. he was underwhelmed claiming there was more breading than fish. i tried a small piece of fish and found it to be light, fluffy, and flakey. i enjoyed it and question his taste buds. decor is seriously cool. people are encouraged to carve into the tables. i worry when beer is involved and people are encouraged to vandalize property; however, madison is keeping it pretty classy. i did attempt to turn every hashtag into a game of tic tac toe. service was great and friendly. not sure how knowledgeable the staff is regarding the beer selection as i didnt ask any questions. she did praise my choice of the mussels so i think they are pretty competent. we will absolutely be back!
very friendly and helpful service.  great atmosphere.  awesome beer selection and very good burgers.  fries are offthehook.  highly recommend.
two words: crack. fries. we went through about 3 orders of them in one night!this is a fun place if you want to eat and drink with a great variety of beer options including a good number of local beers! our server was helpful and service was quick.
my time at hopcat left me with the impression that any combination of food, beer, and experience could leave a person feeling from one to five stars. having shown up and bellied up to the bar in order to a watch the cubs and b not feel bad about eating fish fry alone, my experience was overall favorable.the service at the bar was excellent  friendly, fast, and with good knowledge of the menu. i had two beers off the extensive list, which offered a lot of new options for madison. in particular, they had a few nitro taps, which i enjoyed tremendously. the list seemed short on stoutsporters at the expense of beers more suited for a long night at hopcat, which i dont blame them for.i ordered the fish n chips with crack fries on the side. the fish portions were smaller than is typical for a wisconsin fish fry, but it was cooked very well with a tasty tartar on the side. the crack fries were far too salty, but dipping them in the tartar helped. despite all of the remodeling, somehow it still kind of looks like quaker steak that spaces former incarnation inside. not a quiet place by any means, but as a place to be alone together and enjoy some sports and beer, hopcat fit the bill.
stopped in for lunch after spending the morning at new glarus brewery.  it was packed... as i expect it is quite often.  we got seats at the bar right away and reviewed the rather large tap list. found a few beers we wanted and then ordered some food.  i got the black bean burger and it was pretty damn tasty. the crack fries are good but without the sauce they are just not the same... get the sauce...get extra sauce...then get more. yes, its that good.  i would love to try this place again but also look forward to when they open one in milwaukee.
hopcat has added exactly what was needed to the state street area. its a little more upscale than the younger crowd bars, which is a big plus for me. the beer list is always changing and never disappoints. the food has been delicious  dont skimp on the crack fries! the servers and bartenders have always been attentive and knowledgeable when ive been. late night menu is offered, as well.if you get stuck in the outside line, its never taken me more than ten minutes to get in prior to 10:00. it gets crowded and seating might not be available right away, but with so much room in the bar areas both upstairs and down, ive never minded much.
the menu is good and the beer list is amazing! as a vegetarian, ive only been able to try a few things on the food menu  mainly the appetizers  but ive never had something that i disliked. im a particular fan of the classic pretzel nugz, but thats probably because i love a good cheese sauce.the beer list features 30 local brews that come at a great price if you go on a mon, tues, or wed after 10 pm. definitely worth it. however, with 130 i think beers on tap, youll find many more local brews that come at a more standard price. basically, if you love beer, this is the place for you!now, the reason i gave it four stars is because this place is confusing. i have never had the same experience upon arrival, and ive been here more times than i care to mention. sometimes they seat you, sometimes you seat yourself, sometimes they id you three times, sometimes they id you once, sometimes they have bouncers, sometimes they dont. ive also never seen the upstairs open, though it would clearly be the better place to sit. this would all be fine if they would have some sort of signage saying seat yourself or please wait to be seated, but they dont. its also difficult to tell who is a serverhost because they dont seem to have a uniform, otherwise id just ask!other than initial confusion upon arrival, hopcat is great! oh  and the decor is fantastic!
pretty nice place for a burger and beer during the week when you are downtown. you need to take advantage of the special they run for the burger and local tap beer pairing monday through thursday. on the weekend, it can be crowded and noisy.
we went to hopcat for a friends birthday. so many taps! service is prompt and our server was knowledgeable . the crack fries are a must! it was very busy when we went, so it was understandable that it took a few minutes for our server to come back to take our order. once we ordered, the food came pretty quick! it was a little chilly in there when we went, so i would recommend a sweater. however, we went in the summer, so maybe the ac was cranked up!
hopcat you are up there in my books. we came during their happy hour prior to seeing a show at the overture. half priced burgers  awesome and 3 for local tap beers  amazing. the restaurant itself has a lot of seating, especially at the bar which is huge. theres something for everyone with so many beers on tap to choose from. service was great. a great casual place to meet friends or come after work for happy hour. also, the crack fries are delicious. try them and i promise you wont be disappointed!there are similar other establishments like hopcat popping up around the area. but, after trying other similar places, i have to say that i prefer hopcat over the rest. and the location cant be beat. as it is right off of state street, it is close to anything downtown and easily accessible if your in the area. i will definitely be back again.
stopped in for my first time with my fiance on a friday night the badger basketball team was playing at home. very busy and required a 1015 minute wait, but luckily one of the best things about hopcat is there large beer selection. bar tenders were helpful to pick something out me and my fiance would like while we waited for our table.after getting a text and being seated in their upstairs bar area, we were in a slight rush to get to the game and the waiter was very quick and attentive. ordered another beer but we were seated on the 2nd floor and they dont have their whole selection upstairs. in regards to the food, this is where i thought they lacked. we both ordered the cowboy burger which was good. in regards to the crack fries, the seasoning was good but the fries themselves were overly crispy and in my opinion average. overall, i would definitely go back. they have a good atmosphere and obviously lots of beer to choose from which is always great.
if your face has been good to you lately, treat it well. bring it here to pour beer in it and eat great food. awesome mix of music across decades will have everyone groovin.
its always busy  and for good reason.  the food is great, the tap list is stunningly big, and the service is awesome.  when we can get in, hopcat always makes the list.
go for happy hour!happy hour is mth 26pm and the deals are great! 3 local wi brews theres like 30 to chose from and 12 off burgers! now thats a cheap meal! the burgers are super thick and come with a generous side of their crack fries. now these are said to be in the top 10 best fries in america, and while they are pretty tasty, im not sure i can say top 10. i asked for my burger to be medium and it was more like mediumwell, but it was still a pretty decent burger. between my burger and pint of beer, i only spent 8! cant do much better than that!
more a quantity over quality type place with seemingly 100 craft beer taps, but really only about 1015 of interest. probably 10 or so special releases and another 10 or so of taponly local beers. the rest was just sort of fluff. however, this is at a much higher level than say yard house.beers were served in proper glassware and slightly too cold for my tastes. kegs seemed to be fresh for the most part. however, when you have a 100 tap system, keg rotation suffers and a lot of what is being served im sure is past its prime. i would certainly ask for a taster or splash before committing to a full pour of something pricey.fun, younger crowd and loud, darker atmosphere. the crack fries were out of control amazing. i would come back just for those. did not have a regular meal here.
decent burger, okay waiter and pricy beer. i tried the cowboy burger and it is apparently too much food for a lady. a good gathering place, but also quieter than i expected. id say its a restaurant with a great beer selection rather than a bar.and there is a crack on my friends water glass and none of us noticed until half way through dinner.
their crack fries are amazing! very fun atmosphere on a game day.
in order for a restaurant to get 4 or 5 stars i believe it has to have 3 things done very well  food, atmosphere, and staff.  well the food here is very good.  the spicey fries are absolutely delicious and if you order them as an appetizer like we did they come with a wonderful cheesy dipping sauce. i had the zee burger and my wife had a salad. great food all around! the atmosphere was wonderful considering the type of venue it is. once again i am hearing impaired and the acoustics were not friendly. that is my problem not theres. it is a bar that serves great food just off campus in a major big 10 university on game day. it was a little loud but not over powering. the wait staff was extremely helpful, we even had several staff members who were not ours check to see if all was well. oh and did i mention they have like 90 different beers !  seriously, how does the bartender even find what you ordered? they have tables for 2 to 8 and can handle your group with ease. if you are near state street in madison this is a must. looking forward to going again
a great place to relax. an excellent beer selection, reasonable prices and a nice atmosphere. the service is also pretty quick considering how busy they are some nights.
la petit mort just seemed to look like one of those snug, romantic little places to tuck yourself away with someone and have a lovely few hours with. which is exactly what i did, catching up with a good friend. the great thing  you are not rushed out of the door at any point, and can spend as little, or as long as you want to there. i would say something cheesy like jadore petit mort, but that just sounds plain weird, so lets not.i decided to go all in, and have the parsnip brulee to start. this was the only bum note of the evening, as part of the brulee was warm, part was stone cold, and it didnt really feel right to be so cold, even with our hostess insisting that was right. im guessing it sat under a heater, which made it a little odd, even though technically the flavours were great, i was left feeling a little disconcerted. for the mains, my dining partner opted for the venison, while i went for the smoked bean chilli. now, id had chilli for lunch too, so it did feel like i was going to be underwhelmed by my main through sheer repetitiveness, but the dish was fantastic beats the canteen version all day, every day and i enjoyed every mouthful. sadly though, i was too full to eat anything more, and i had been really looking forward to trying the desserts out, specifically the raspberry bavarois. however, my friend was wise, and had skipped a starter in order to make sure there was room for dessert, opting for the assiette of chocolate  which i was allowed to sample, with care, of course. rich, decadent, a splendid way to finish the night, and we rolled off into the september evening, our bellies full and our hearts happy. ill be back for the raspberry bavarois another day.
the vegan options are a nice touch. the fruit toppings are all fresh and not covered in syrup. very clean and friendly staff.
i really enjoyed this place. my earl grey tea infused with caramel was delightful. ditto my vegan parfait. i have no idea how one makes vegan yogurt but i am happy to report it tastes just as good if not better than the real thing. my parfait was loaded with freshly cut fruit. jason l was very happy with his homemade scone.the cats were numerous, and very friendly. i grew particularly fond, of a big tuxedoed guy, who stole my straw right from my glass and proceeded to play with it the rest of our visit. a number of the other cats came right up to our table and demanded pets and snuggles. there was a wide range of both kittens and older cats. most of the cats are adoptable which i think is awesome! its a brilliant way to socialize otherwise skittish cats. there appears to be a lot of crevices,beds, and hiding places for the cats a good way to keep them from becoming overstimulated by their admirers. the cafe itself was clean and spacious. unlike some cat cafes  which can feel musty cafe verona was very modern and bright. it did not suffer from cat odor. to summarize; cafe venosa is a great place to relax and to  get away from the hustle and bustle of city life.
well located place in downtown. the chill room is a nice idea and good to dine with a big group of friends. the room however needs more lighting and less speakers to make it more comfortable to eat and be able to converse.the food and service are great. foie gras poutine was really good.alaskan crab salad is delicious.share a 1 kg tbone with your friends, dont miss it.a great place to dine and party afterwards.
location: east of atwater, on notredame. the closest subway is lionelgroulx orange and its less than a 10minute walk from there. street parking is available  both metered and not. there are certain streets that are not zoned where you can park without paying.the place: its not much bigger than their previous location but the layout is better. the decor is more urban and clean, if you will. very simple, no bells and whistles. i do miss the other locations funky furniture as i think it added charm and a unique style, but what can you do? i do find the lighting to be a little dim. one of my favourite things about lili  oli is the music: 80s alternative. love it. the goods: ive ordered an almond milk latte both times ive stopped in, and they were both enjoyable. service: well, the barista is still a little surly and smiling is not his forte but again, what can you do. he makes some decent coffee and thats why i go there.price point: 4 for the latte  i dont think there is an extra charge for the almond milk but im not 100 sure.
happened to walk by this place and decided to order a latte. was a little unorganized trying to order as it is set up like a bar so there isnt really a place to stand in line.my latte was delicious though so it made up for the confusion.downside to this cafe is that they only take cash.
new redesign is cool. also great coffee.
first visit the manager was very nice and greeting everyone. the fries were nice and crunchy all the way to the end! first experience with poutine and i would totally eat it again! got the small philly and a 12 pound cheeseburger and split with my husband. it was great.only downfall is the awkward seating.
saw this new spot on mill so i thought id give it a try before the movie. first thing right off the bat i notice the amazing interior. the split level room gives it a unique look. they also have a few tvs as well. second thing is the staff, the customer service was surprisingly great. everyone including the folks were very nice. the one thing i have to say is maybe instead of screaming out our name over the music is giving us numbers and having someone bring us the food. that would be my only complaint. overall the food was great. got the large and shared it with my boyfriend. the large filled us both up so its for sure meant for at least two people.
an enjoyable experience. ive never tried poutine and i got excited when i heard about this place offering a vegetarian version. everyone was super friendly here and we friend and i both thought the dish was pretty tasty. we added hot sauce to it because we felt it needed an extra kick. since ive never had poutine before, i have no point of comparison but i appreciated the veg version with the mushroom gravy, mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions. the fries were clearly hot and fresh. the regular as opposed to the large was a good size and we were both able to finish it. it wouldnt be a good dish to take as leftovers since its meant to be eaten hot.
the most amazing and creative place ive been in a while. i think the name of the restaurant is what has turned some people off from wanting to try it out.the idea of eating fries for dinner doesnt sound all that appealing to most, unless youve had poutine as a meal before. all of the variations on their menu are delicious, ive had the traditional, the philly cheesesteak, and the cheeseburger poutine. ive also tried their burgers, which were delicious and huge! im a big guy and was not able to finish all of my food because of how filling it all was.the decor inside is definitely a touch of class. they have a large table that can seat multiple parties without the feeling of being cramped. they have tvs everywhere and those cool coke machines that have a bunch of customizable flavors.the only knock that i would say i had was the pricing. it was a little pricey, but i didnt complain much because i used a promotion through an app to get a modest discount. the price of the poutine is the only thing that prevented me from giving this place 5 stars.great service too! i didnt have to wait more than 15 minutes for a large order for 2.
i was so happy to see this place pop up but my excitement was short lived when i saw the prices. 6 for a small box of cheese curds? oh honey! theyre bomb but it prevents me from ordering anything else. 3 star for the prices and slight wait, but 4 stars for quality, staff professionalism and ambiance  decor. just remember fries and curds are a meal! but thats it, dont fix yourself to order anything more or youll question if that total was correct.in response to the owners comments: i didnt want to mention the poutine because i hate poutine, ive had it before, unlike other people its not a wacky new thing to me. i generally do not like toppings or condiments and i hate gravy. if they even scaled their prices back by .99 it would be that more affordable. or give even 30 more cheese curds because what you get for the mandatory large size is not a lot compared to the other sides.
i was in the area attending a fundraising event.  but i had to hit this place up since it was around the corner: poutine fries with beef, crispy onions, jalepenos  horsey sauce with a lemon eegees...yum!!!  the food was so good and the service was great.  the gentleman was friendly and accommodating. this was the first time ive tried poutine, since learning about it.
in tempe we stopped at us fries for a poutine lunch. kids shared a large traditional poutine that was very similar to put nyf poutine back in canada 3.55. my fiancee and i had the vegetarian poutine which had a nice flavour but nothing too memorable 3.55. free refills on pop and free water. good value at 23 to feed the four of us.
us fries is a cool spot to hangout at mill ave on crazy nights, they have awesome food that will fill you up real quick. cant seem to get myself to eat there as much as i want to because the food is so rich that you get tired of it quickly. either way the food is a great, the place is great, and the owner tom is great.
i cant believe all of the negative reviews on this place. theyve been open a week, people! chill!  yes, there is a bit of a wait. give these guys some time and im sure theyll run a tighter ship before long. i have been here twice and have been happy both times. the people that work here are all very friend and nice. i take onboard that its pricey, but for 16 i got a 13 patty cooked medium rare, the way i like it, with cheddar, bleu cheese, bacon, spinach, grilled onions and sauteed mushrooms with a side of onion strings. the patty was solid: fresh and cooked to perfection; all of the extras were of high quality and the onion strings were delicious. i thought that they give you plenty of food. yes, you pay more, but were talking high quality ingredients, not precooked mcdonalds. i cant afford to do this every day but i deserve something like this once or twice a month. im really eager to try their milkshakes....and then theres the bar. again, dont let the negative reviews deter you, this is right up my alley. if youre short on time, give them a few weeks to settle in or go later in the day, not during the lunch rush.
this little spot will hopefully become popular. drinks were nicely done. food need a little work service .... well they just opened so.... im hoping it gets better. the veggie burger was great! the regular burgers slightly under done. not sure but i think the fries were frozen not fresh and they were out of the onion strings for the toppings. pickle chips were yummy
resturants these days have moved to wood or metal seats not good for my scrawny ass. buildaburger is following this unfortunate for me trend. started out with a grand canyon amber. excellent beir! had to sit at the counter, clean, baseball on both wide screen tvs. my beer glass has a small chip. i will tell them. basically you fill out a form with checks in boxes to have your sandwich custom made. a lot of good options here: beef, chicken, bison, turkey burger i think even a veggie option. multiple cheese offerings, multiple veggie toppings available. a handful of sides and several bun choices. you can even get your burger in a bowl bun free. i got 13 lb beef on multi grain bun, mixed greens, grilled onions, grilled tomatoes, no cheese. my side is homemade chili. we shall see
the counter has a pretty awesome menu and build you own burger has so many options that you will need to come back to try more. the shakes are delicious and you can taste the quality ice cream they claim to use! great place for lunch or dinner. the only negative is this is located right at the light rail platform which causes quite the rumble and shakes the whole restaurant. if the rumble every 7 to 12 minutes doesnt bother you, try this place!!
would have given five star as the food and waiter was great. we were there last saturday night 18th july. the girl at the entrance needs some training.  she was not very professional or welcoming. she made us wait 20mins even though 4 tables were open and then said no to my request to take the empty booth. other than that i will go back and recommend.  food and waiters service was very good.
loved the place. ordered the custom built veggie burger. there are tons of choices. my friend built a regular burger. i  had a side of sweet potatoes which were super yummy and age had the shoestring fries. she enjoyed them. went on a whim on a wednesday evening. pretty slow but crew was very friendly. its downtown so parking sucks. i had a strawberry lemonade which doesnt have free refills. i didnt give it 5 stars due to that, parking, and its a little pricey. overall fun experience and good food.
food was really good. we had custom burgers, regular fries,sweet potatoe fries and a milk shake. the burgers were on brioche buns and they were great. only complaint about the burger was the .50 charge for thousand island dressing. both types of fries were really good!  i would have given 5 stars, but the kitchens timing was way off.  the milk shake too a really long time to come out.  also our burgers and sweet potatoe fries came out together, but the regular fries did not come out until we wer half way through everything else. also my expensive thousand island dressing was left off my burger and i had to ask for it.  fix the kitchen problems by the next time and i will gladly give 5 stars.
so this was my first time here and it was surprisingly good. i wasnt in the mood for burgers so i had a buffalo chicken sandwich and that was good. one thing i did learn is that i hate blue cheese. it was in my sandwich and oh my god i wanted to cry. but i just took out the blue cheese and the sandwich is good afterwards. let me talk about the starters we had....they were delicious. it was nothing fancy but it was so good! we had sweet potato fries and onion strings. the sauces they gave for the fries and strings were what made it so delicious. if theres one thing i would go back for it would be the fries and strings....silly, i know. but overall this place is great. we went on a friday night half an hours before closing and the staff were really nice, it wasnt busy at all  because it was close to closing time, and me and family enjoyed our meal and drinks.
good quality ingredients, it is a bit pricey but you are getting what you pay for.  food quality seems consistent but the wait staff quality is not that great, everyone is friendly but all 3 times i have been here something or multiple things have gotten messed up and it takes a while to eat here. expect more than an hour for lunch.
im rarely in the mood for a burger these days, especially since they all seem the same. i mean, how creative can a burger get anymore?i didnt try any of their specialty burgers  i decided to build my own. i know thats not new or anything, but when you have things like sun dried tomatoes, pesto, grated parmesan.. you can make one helluva burger.the service was great, the beef was cooked extremely well and the view of the city and light rail made for very interesting people watching through their large double pane windows.only downside imo is location. parking is a bit tough, but dont let that deter you. check it out and tell them chris sent you.ok, dont tell them that. they probably have no idea who i am.
good vegan burger. i had the korean bbq burger with a vegan patty. everything tasted really fresh and good. had a banana, chocolate, and marshmallow shake for dessert, it was excellent!
food took longer than expected due to a convention in town. but other then that the staff is super friendly great food and even greater shakes. the bison burger was great and i had a custom grey goose shake it was amazingly good!
i love the atmosphere here and the donuts  also the coffee omg i wish i lived closer!
well one could say that the university area now has more of a lock on the fauxmex cuisine thanks to qdoba, chipotle, and now tijuana flats popping up all within walking distance of each other. thanks to a yelp event last year, i visited the nowdefunct east blvd location so i had a notion of how the place works and how the food tastes. this location seems a little smaller than the east blvd location but definitely still has most of the attitude, and i mean that in a good way. tjs walls are covered in graffiti art, sassy bumper stickers, and staff pictures. its definitely a good fit for the university area. id been eager to stop by ever since its opening and thanks to a severe taco craving, i made a visit. i was immediately greeted and walked up to the togo order side. the woman taking my order informed me of the days special it was tijuana tuesdaze which i already knew and means two tacos, chips and drink for under 6 so i put my order in for two chicken tacos and decided to go for the guac on the side which is extra, duh!. as i waited for my order to come out, i got to see the famed hot sauce bar. seriously, if you fancy yourself a hot sauce fan, try all the sauces. theres plenty of seating inside to not make you feel like youre sitting on top of anybody else and theres also a small patio area out front. the staff seemed really upbeat and willing to break down the explanations for any menu items. i witnessed this first hand as two people were completely confused by their chimichangas and the make it wet twss! option. as for beverages, they offer the standard sodatea options as well as margaritas, sangria, and beer. my order came out and the guy who brought it to me made sure he read it back and confirmed my order. i opened up my container and was pleasantly surprised by how neat and delicious everything looked. be not concerned, for the taco special they do not skimp on the taco size! everything tasted just as good as i remembered and i will be frequenting tijuanas on tuesdays and any other time the taco craving hits!
took friends that were passing through town and wanted something quick and fresh for dinner and we all loved it! the service was outstanding and the food was great! prices are affordable and the concept of the place is well executed. it relates to other places like chipotle and qdoba but has a way larger menu and takes longer to get your food. its more of a on the border menu. we were really impressed and will be back again! thanks for a quick, healthy, cheap and fresh dinner!
my sisters and i checked out tijuana flats for an early dinner last week. overall good experience.orders are placed at the register and prepared in the back. i prefer chipotles and qdobas rightinfrontofyou prep but okay...two of us had the throwback thursdaze special for 5.99. the other ordered tostitos but she thought she was ordering a quesadilla.the tt special consisted of a tijuana burrito, chips, and a drink.the burritos are customizable. i had mine in a hemp tortilla. delicious.the table we sat at was a rectangle for four. there was enough room on the table top but i felt like i could use a bit more elbow room between me and sister one.i was afraid of the famed hot sauce bar. wussy old me tried one very mild sauce. the more daring sister one tried a few of of the sauces including a very hot one. sister two and i laughed like loons at sister one as she wiped her runny eyes and nose.the staff checked on us every so often, offering refills on drinks, removing our trash, and asking if there was anything we needed.a nice evening out and not a lot of money spent.ill go back.
erika and nikki were such great hosts. tijuana flats held a yelp event for us tonight and it turned out great! the food was so fresh and yummy. chicken flautas were my favorite. they have the biggest selection of hot sauces ive ever seen!!!!! this place is brand new and right across from the hospital in the university area! great for college students, reasonably priced and super fun and clean atmosphere! take 85 to harris blvd, its tucked down in a shopping center! if you like mexican its a step above moes  little patio if the weather isnt as hot as its been! ahhh just wait for fall!  get your booty into tijuanas youll be happy you came. its quick and tasty and the staff is sook friendly
first time at this location  the service was great! someone is at the door greeting you when you walk in asking if its your first time there  directing you where to go. the food came out fast  when you eat in they bring it to you. the staff is constantly checking to make sure your okay  if you need drink refills. nice place for lunch or dinner and prices are very reasonable.
im not going to lie, my first experience was not good but i am so glad i gave them a second shot. i didnt like their nachosim from texas so i put queso on my nachos, not shredded cheese. i came in again for taco tuesday and i must say, these are some of the best tacos ive had in charlotte. the portions are really good for the price. i come here anywhere from 23 a month.
i was familiar with this chain from fl. food is very good albeit a tad pricey. hot sauce bar is great.
full disclosure: i didnt try the meat because, well, i dont eat land animals. my midwest family got some smoked turkey and pork sandwiches and the consensus was that their lunch was good, but expensive.we came here because we are a saint louis people and saint louis people 1 apparently love bbq and 2 love scouting out other saint louis people, and this place is run by a stl family. i grabbed a salad, average, but was impressed with my green chili mac n cheese it had corn and red peppers in there too! and the gooey butter cake. no one can make gooey butter cake like my mom, but this was pretty good.the inside design was cool and the kids staffing the counter were friendly and talkative. pretty much everything is ala cart. if you like meat and eating in places with that smoke house smell and you arent on a budget this is a good place to try.
been there four times now. really liked the burnt ends, brisket and tritip, good smokey flavor and really juicy brisket thats not dry and crumbling like some other places. i thought the turkey was underwhelming, but then again, i shouldnt be getting turkey when theres other better meat to be had. spicy sauce is really good. the space has a nice build out and is welcoming, though i agree with another reviewer that the food delivery system wandering around the place calling out names for each item is inefficient. what got me was the prices versus portion sizes, as well as the sides. they dont really offer a complete meal with meat and a side or two, but rather everything is a la carte. so if you want a half pound of meat, a side, and a drink, youre looking at well over 20. while the foods good i just cant see that lasting in this neighborhood...might want to consider a price adjustment or a meal deal where someone can sample a couple meats and a side.
holy cow! my first bbq experience in phoenix was great! i love the laid back atmosphere; the disposable dinnerware and self bussing tables makes it feel like youre at someones house, not a restaurant. the smoke on the ribs was perfect.  the chili beans are just like my dad makes. my only negative is that the noodles in the green chile mac were overcooked. other than that, i was not disappointed. ill definitely be returning.
on our way to costco i saw bbq and decided to try.  when you walk in its a bit dark inside. i ordered the turkey gumbo and my husband ordered the bbr.  he loved that they didnt put the sauce on because he always feel they over add it.  he can add as he wishes. my gumbo was good but not overly excited about it, it was just good. so i liked the place but my husband loved it. yes, ill be back and i will recommend it to my friends.the only recommendation is to have hot sauce.
just had excellent pulled pork sandwiches fries nice and crispy, good coleslaw.need to up the game on beerwine, real limited and the wine pours were chintzy for a 9 dollar glass
great bbq! the staff was friendly and helpful. simple concept but very well done. reminded me of the south. i was very impressed with the use of flavors from the meat to the beans. must try items: pulled pork, baked beans, corn, and defiantly the mac n cheese!
great brisket, generous portions, nice atmosphere. tangy sauce was delicious. loved the side corn, really fresh. cole slaw needs a little help pretty bland, no dressing to be found maybe i got a bad scoop. gooey butter cake was amazing. good service, friendly attentive staff.
went there for my first time with my roommate and a buddy with his girlfriend.  when i got my ribs, i was expecting them to near fall off the bone, however, they did not.  i usually go to outback as i like the soften of their meat and the ease at which it comes off the bone. now, there are others who really like their ribs, but for me, it just wasnt what i was expecting, so if you are expecting an outback type ribs, you will be disappointed.  but again, this is only my opinion and you may just love them like many others do!  the sauce is really good, i can say at least.  but this is what sets this restaurant apart from many others, and that is how they handle an unhappy customer.  the owner took the ribs off my bill, offered me something else, then brought me a complimentary side of chilibeans which were very good.  and then he brought out table a dessert to share for free.  to me, that would make me come back to try their pulled pork, which my roommate enjoyed.  its rare these days where you find owners really appreciative of the patrons business, and thats something that i fully value as a customer.
i lived in texas for 10 years, so i know good bbq.  staff super friendly, reasonable prices, and for arcadia area, very convenient.
first time at frashers.  food was ready in less than five minutes, and was excellent.  baby backs had tons of meat, and great smoky flavor.  pulled pork was moist.   baked beans are more like bean and beef chili, and were also excellent.  im a kc bbq snob, and have never found an acceptable bbq joint in phx in 25 years.  this is my new place.only suggestion is that spicy sauce could be way more spicy.  theres not much of a kick and some of us like heat!!
this little shop is in the heart of the grand bazaar shops. all workers ive encountered have been friendly, and truly care about delivering quality sandals. i was interested only in wedges, and satisfied myself on a pair of neutrals and blacks. havaianas are a higher quality sandal, noted for comfort and their studs. there was a pair of display sandals that had pyramidal studs that went all along the tong portion.. sadly these studs werent in stock, but the lady who worked there felt uncomfortable decorating the sandals the same way with a different stud. she repetitively insisted that she didnt want to ruin the quality of the sandal, which i appreciated... but was kind of unfortunate.at the end of the day, im still i got a pair of comfortable sandals that arent the same as everyone elses. these were definitely worth the small splurge on my small vegas trip. walking up and down the strip can be killer on anyones feet, and these definitely were comfy those kinds of days! the studs really added to make these flip flops look dressier, while maintaining their casual style.
cute place to pick up a pair of flip flops to wear around the pool. they have a descent selection and all of them were really cute. i loved the giant flip flop in front.
experience:  my friend lance check out his review on here tried this place an raved about the food. so he invited a few friends to come try it out. we came around 7:00 for dinner. facility: beautiful!  this is a very upscale, modern decor with heavy indian influence. so beautifully done!!! they have tables and chairs, bar seating, and some booths. they have some outside seating coming soon too!  i loved being able to look around and having some things to look at...from the ballywoodesque mural, to the beautiful window treatments. i have to mention the seats were pretty comfortable too, which is rare in a restaurant. service:  this is the only reason, im marking them down. otherwise they would have a 5 star from me. they are very polite servers; however, the first thing we ordered, was my cheese naan and the eggplant. this was my main meal. the cheese naan was the last thing that came out, after asking 4 times for it.  i was actually full eating other folks food by the time i got it. one waitress i questioned on the status said they didnt even have cheese naan, although it was on the menu. then she brought another garlic naan instead. when they finally brought my naan, they said the extra garlic naan they brought by mistake was on them.  of course!  how about comping my cheese naan instead!  they also took forever to bring out another friends chicken marsala. hopefully they get it together soon. i do love how personable the staff was, and the owner even came out to greet and talk to us.food:  amazing!  i love indian food and this did not disappoint.  everything we had was good...honestly, there was nothing i disliked. we ordered a lot, so i will try to remember all we ordered. we asked for everything very hot on the spicy scale. cheese naan  55 so good and cheesy!!!garlic naan  55 hot and fresh!basmati rice  we had order rice to go along with our meals, as its not included. it was cooked perfectly. chili paneer  65 yep, that good!  it had a great chili sauce it was tossed in, and was crispy outside, with a creamy, cheesy middle. yum!!!murgh tikka trio  45 every piece of chicken was spiced well and still juicy in the middle. i did find myself adding more sauce though. samosa  45 loved, but the cheese corn was not my fav.  i loved the potato the most and then the pea. they were all crispy, hot and good!baingan bharta  the eggplant dish i ordered  55 so yum with a nice texture from the pop of the peas. i loved the flavor and this went well with the naan chicken saag  55 great flavors, tender chicken. madras  55 we ordered the lamb for this one...it was my favorite. it was creamy and loaded with flavor. loved to dip my naan in the sauce too!!!chicken tikka marasala  55 this was the spiciest of our dishes with an amazing flavori also wished they offered something complimentary, such as naan with a full meal or even the rice with a big order such as ours.  i hate when places make you order every piece of the meal to make it a meal. overall: i do realize, they are brand new and still working on their groove, so im definitely willing to come back in a month or so, and hope they got it all together, so i can bump to a 5. because the food is already there!!!!!come try it out!  its delicious!!!
the food was delicious. so much flavor and just the right amount of spiciness. so glad to finally have an indian restaurant close by. definitely will be back to try the other items on the menu.the chicken tiki masala was too spicy for my mom but was the perfect amount of heat for me. the red pepper soup was delicious and refreshing. the garlic naan was amazing!would give 5 stars but the wait for the food and check was a little long for not having many people in the restaurant.
we have only been here a couple of times and its nice to finally have a good indian restaurant on the southwest  side. food is pretty good and you can taste the fresh ingredients they use. unfortunately, because they just opened they have some kinks to work out regarding service wait time but im sure itll fix itself eventually.
so glad this place opened up around the corner. i ordered the veggie samosa, chicken tikka masala, tandoori salmon and garlic naan. it was very good, however i do wish the tikka masala was a little creamier. food was hot and fresh, service was good. i did have an instance where my server blonde haired lady was behind the bar chatting with other servers, looked at me and laughed rudely. i could not hear what was said but it did make me uncomfortable. another server i believe indian herself, was on top of her game making sure we had our drinks, plates were taken and had an actual conversation with us to make us feel welcome. i will of course go back because it was so tasty and the ambiance was amazing. i just hope they make everyone feel welcomed.
it wont take a psychic to see more indian dinners in my future now that theres a quality spot around these parts.i was sold on lamb rogan josh within seconds of perusing the menu.  the boneless pieces of braised lamb in thick, rich curry hit the inside spot that only indian cuisine can.  the slow cooked tenderness of the meat was ideal and required minimal work with a knife.  hearty and comforting, it was like wearing a mental snuggie.my wife got the saag paneer and enjoyed every bit of its pureed spinach glory.  their homemade cheese was a bit different than any other weve tried as it was softer, more like buffalo mozzarella, yet it still retained some of that signature firmness that made it undeniably paneer.  maybe their secret is milk with a higher fat content?  we ordered this dish hot which wasnt over the top spicy, but a nice smooth burn from start to finish.   the 6 vegetable sides were great to see as well.  many places dont offer a half portion, so if i really wanted chana masala, my only choice would be to order an extra entree.  we went with the baingan bharta, basically an eggplant mash which was a nice change up from the other plates.  i also liked that the bowls of rice that accompanied each dish were of generous portions unlike their only nearby competitor a few miles south, which only offer rice in a kid size.i am curious to see if they stick with entrees for lunch or cave with the rest of the in crowd and go buffet.  that wont deter me from going back during those hours though.  cant wait to try more!
flavors are on point here at curry leaf. no buffet, just a la carte entrees, apps, sides, and desserts. i stuck to some fairly safe favorite dishes and found them all to be of great quality with deep, complex flavors. ambiance is going for an upscale feel but pricing is reasonable.saag paneer: pure vegetarian indian comfort, with unusually creamy and plentiful paneer. pairs fabulously with the garlic naan which was deliciously fragrant and beautifully blistered, this is my preferred meal.rogan josh: bfs pick, ordered medium, with a spicy and flavorful sauce. lamb was in large, plentiful chunks but could have been more tender. both main dishes included rice.baingan bharta: side of tandoorismoked eggplant mash was contender for my favorite dish, with great smoky flavor and good texture. a bargain at 6side.kulfi trio: we couldnt resist dessert, and the housemade ice creams fulfilled out sweets craving with a bright mango flavor, sweet raspberry, and nutty pistachio. couldnt pick a favorite as they were all good, with great creamy consistency. interior is upscale with modern but slightly uncomfortable chairs and a large bar area but no alcohol license?, makes for an intimate datenight dinner spot. unclear whether they plan to expand seating into the adjacent patio area. service was attentive and polite throughout. this is one of those places i would come back and get the exact same meal, rather than trying more on the menu. they do the classic dishes extremely well and the portions were generous. great option for a vegetarian meal.
i have been wanting to try this place ever since i saw the sign while running errands. i always order the same entree every time i have indian food which is the dal makhani. i ordered the mild which was a bit watery and not very spicy at al compared to the other times that i have had it. the rest of the food that we ordered were great. very good service and great atmosphere. i will be back will just order something different.
its always a plus when your greeted at the door with a sincere smile.  the food was excellent with great flavors.  we tried the lamb rogan josh  some madras chicken.  the only downfall was the naan bread, it was a bit to chewy to really enjoy.  other then that its nice to have good quality indian cuisine nearby.
after reading my friend, philip t.s review, i knew i had to come here and im so glad i did.  i got here at 12:15.  the restaurant is a pleasant place with lots of thought put into the interior design.i was seated promptly and given the lunch and wine menus.  i was brought water immediately and i looked at the menu although i had quite thoroughly studied the lunch offerings.  their lunch menu is small but there are some very good choices.my server came to take my order and i got the lamb rogan josh.  when asked if i wanted it hot, medium, or mild for spiciness, i questioned how hot their hot was.  i know, stupid question!  when navi, my server, explained that it was hot i opted to go with medium but he offered another choicemedium to hot.  that was it.  btw, next time ill get the hot.  this was spicy but it doesnt hit high on my spiciness meter.  i was given a choice of plain, butter, or garlic naan and i went with the garlic.after taking some photos of the restaurant, the food arrived and i was ready to dig in.  the lamb rogan josh, a kashmiri dish, was perfect!  there was a nice degree of spiciness to compliment the fennel, ginger, onion, and kashmiri spice sauce.  the lamb was nicely tender.  the garlic naan was one of the few ive gotten where ive tasted much garlic.  tearing pieces of naan and grabbing rice and sauce with my fingers, i was enjoying lunch to the max.while eating, navi asked me if i was a photographer and i explained reviewing for yelp.  in a short time, the chefowner came out to greet me and ask me how i found out about the restaurant and how i liked the food.  we chatted for a bit and i noticed on his chefs jacket, there were both curry leaf flavors of india and saffron flavors of india.  it turns out he cooked at saffron for a couple of years for his brotherinlaw and now has opened his own place.  he went to another table and then returned to the kitchen.  a very pleasant, welcoming man!when finished, navi asked about dessert.  i didnt want rice pudding and my experiences with gulab jamun in the past have been mixed.  but, i opted for the gulab jamun.  navi asked if i wanted it hot or cool.  i dont think ive ever had it any way but somewhat cool so i went with hot.  what a great choice!!  the saffron, cardamom syrup on the fried milk cakes was excellent.  there was sweetness but it was just right.  there were also small pieces of slivered almond which i havent seen before.i was there for about an hour.  thats not indicative of slowness with the kitchen.  wait time was short, but i wanted to savor the lamb and its sauce to the maximum so i didnt hurry with my lunch.  others left the restaurant during this time and werent replaced with new customers.  im wondering if they can make it without a lunch buffet.  the price is more than indian buffets near unlv.  the nice thing for me is that its so close to home.i took a photo of their large patio.  i forgot to ask if they would have tables there when its cooler but it would make a nice place to eat out when the 100 degree weather leaves.  and before i left, i took one of their menus so i can order take out next week.  im so glad theyre here!
tasted great. clean environment. professional waitress. ordered off the lunch menu. samosa trio, chicken saag, paneer makhani. entrees included rice and naan; chose plain naan. all dishes were very tasty. rice and naan were prepared well. will definitely come back again. i recommend to anyone to visit.
just moved to this side of town and was craving indian food. placed an order over the phone it was ready in 20mins!! i got chicken tikka marsala chicken saag both medium spice it came with basmati rice and an order of garlic naan. this is a nice clean quaint establishment with great food one of the best indian foods ive had thus far!  4 stars because price is a little high but i guess its the going rate for indian food here in vegas.the only downside is the service is slowwwww.
in a little strip mall off ft apache  tropicana .. i really enjoyed this place . they dont have a lunch buffet but the 2 things we got  chicken tikka masala and chicken korma were both awesome. i liked the korma best ! service was friendly and quick . good quality  fair prices  we will return ;
the food was really tasty, i had the chicken tikka masala and naan, and the restaurant was very clean, and the service was professional and courteous. the restaurant is tucked back into the corner of the center, so you have to go hunting for it, but once you find it, it is well worth the search. my portions were a little small, im a big guy and like to eat a lot, especially good indian food. i did go during lunch and so my portion was most likely a smaller, lunch, portion. i plan on going again during dinner to eat again, and hope ill get more of this delicious food.
this place was absolutely wonderful. our waitress was amazing and i give her 5 stars! i finally found a place in vegas that offers delicious indian food. i had the lamb rogan josh and it was extremely spicy and extremely tasty. you can choose your level of heat. this is a must try !had a taste of other items on the menu and i loved them all. definitely check this place out at least once. i know ill be back.
great food and really excellent and fast service. was a little pricey and the menu selection was a bit limited, especially for an indian restaurant. otherwise, well above average. will go again!
decor was surprisingly nice. staff was friendly. food was excellent. seemed a little pricey for what you get. wished they had a buffet for lunch. would definitely go back.i had madras curry vegan and my son had tandoor platter. mine was excellent. tandoor meat was dry.
gobi manchurian, so awesome!  loved the vindaloo!  not the best location but the place was clean and the servicer was helpful. i would come back to try other specialties.
ordered a 2 and change with tax cinnamon roll.  it had copious amounts of cream cheese frosting on top and tasted very fresh.  it was okay when eaten as is, but amazing once i microwaved it for a food 20 seconds.for being brand new, its a little disappointing they didnt start out with brand new dining furniture inside.  the chairs look very worn down, and the interior in general has a very bland look to it.the woman behind the counter owner? was very nice though, so ill be back if i want to splurge on a donut again, especially considering their super convenient location.  many of their products looked similar to rainbow maple bacon for example so i can see them giving the nearby location of that delicious local chain some competition if northern can get their name out there and people in the door.
walked in about an hour before they closed on a weekday and they had a great selection, and we were able to get a bakers dozen for 9.74 including tax!this is not good.  donuts that good, that close to where i live, at that low of a price?yikes.they have specialty donuts as well as the standard donuts and cinnamon rolls and all types of pastries including donut holes.they guy behind the counter was a riot and seemed to be quite the mellow and light hearted soul, great experience all the way around
doughnuts are amazing and id technically give the doughnuts a 5. the place just needs some top to bottom cleaning. they nail the old fashioned doughnut.
the staff was great and very friendly. they wanted to make sure i was satisfied in everyway possible. for a donut shop, i feel like their coffee selection and equipment was not what it should have been. the donuts were good, but heavy. i personally like a lighter and fluffier donut. these donuts were dense and because they were dense seemed to hold more of the oil they were cooked in. everyone has their own preference, i did enjoy them none the less.
pretty solid donut place. stopped here for breakfast since the hotel breakfast was pretty bad. great variety and prices were reasonable too. staff was friendly and checkout was a breeze. do yourself a favor and stop by when your in town.
crispy, great donuts. staff eager to please. free wifi. 1 for styrofoam coffee cups and other unnecessary fittings.
wait was long but service was good.
went back to larsens after the owner and general manager responded to my previous review. they wanted to understand what my experience was and try to improve. so we went back this evening. first i must say i was mis informed when i thought this was supposed to be a high end steakhouse. that is not this restaurants model. so this time i ordered the chilean sea bass, which the waiter highly recommended. it was delicious!!! my husband ordered the dry aged filet mignonagain and he enjoyed it.  the sides with our meals were properly seasoned and very good. ordered the apple pie for dessert and again it was very good! as before, the service and staff were excellent and treated us very well. we will go back again and i recommend that more of my henderson neighbors give it a shot! thank you to the owner and general manager for making an effort to reach out to your clients!
we had a great dinner at larsens last night. jeremy, our waiter was superb!! the sashimi appetizer was over the top. thank you! we will return.
i wavered between 3 and 4 stars.  heres why... service and wait time were phenomenal 5 stars, but our food ranged from 25 stars.i made a reservation on open table, and we were seated immediately in a nice elevated booth.  our server arrived right behind the hostess to take our drink order.  the beer came out in a pretty awesome glass i dubbed a punch bowl and they had the clearest uncloudy iced tea i have ever seen.  both were cold and delicious.  we started with fantastic salads that are large enough to share: wedge salad 9 egg, tomatoes, bacon, candied pecans, bleu cheese crumbles and bleu cheese dressing.  dont tell flemings but this is better than their wedge salad! chop salad 8rromaine and iceberg, hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, jack cheese, chopped egg and garbanzo beans tossed in champagne vinaigrette.  simply delicious.  lots of different flavors in each bite.entrees: prime rib 12oz with garlic mashed 34the garlic mashed was creamy and flavorful, but the prime rib was very cold when it arrived, fattier than we expected, and slightly overcooked.  they offered to reheat it and it was marginally better, but the flavor was just not that good.  i am not sure if it was a bad cut of meat or an off night, but i dont think it is something wed order again to find out.prime dry aged filet 8oz with a loaded baked potato 49 the filet was utterly fantastic; a buttery melt in your mouth bliss that i kept eating far after i should have stopped.  sadly or luckily since i was full, the potato was pointless.  it was bland and undercooked.  i also ordered a side of broccoli that looked amazing, but was also undercooked.  very hard.  i wanted a dinner veggie; not crudites.desserts: chocolate peanut butter cake very rich, but very good.  the cake was moist and the whipped cream tasted homemade. we took 95 of this cake to go sans ice cream but we wanted to try it at the restaurant.apple pie omg, i think they stole this recipe from my grandmother!  devine crisp apples, cinnamon, and not overly sweet.  a winner for sure!side note; like flemings, you can get a 100 gift card at costco for 79.99.  built in 20 savings.
menu was nice. steak was very good. prices are a bit above average, but he food was very tasty.
lunch at larsens was lovely!located at the galleria mall its an easy find.  we stopped in on a weekend during lunch hours.  it wasnt too busy at all so we were greeted and seated immediately.   there is a very comfortable dining setting.  they have patio dining as well when the weather cools down.  our waiter was awesome.  he was very professional and attentive.  he had a great understanding of the background of larsens along with the menu.  i decided to try their stuffed chicken.  it was lightly breaded filled with artichokes, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and cheese.   the portion size was enormous.  i think they used two large chicken breasts which provided enough for me to have two more leftover meals.  the ingredients gave it a wonderful flavor.  i was happy with the lighter breading as well.   the accompanying sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus were also good.  again it was a large side of mashed potatoes that i easily shared.   we enjoyed a lovely meal and would be more than happy to come back.
we went to larsens grill in henderson for a belated bd dinner. the atmosphere was nice, they have only been open for a few days so they didnt have everything on the menu. only reason i didnt give 5 stars i was looking forward to prime rib.... who doesnt have prime rib.attire is whatever you are wearing, very casual.i had the tritip and ribs bbq plate with a fully loaded baked potato. the tritip was so tender and the rack of ribs were very tasty.our server was very professional and knowledgable. my ice tea glass was never empty.im going back, these assured me they would have prime rib soon.
the ambience is charming and slightly oldschool glam the chandeliers mixed with hardwood floors upscale neighborhood bar feeling .  happy hour is awesome deal from 5 to 7 they have a select menu of delicious food and cocktails.  my favorite happy hour foods are the prime rib sliders, the tomato mozzarella with reduction and pesto, and sometimes the when should salad or garlic fries.   my favorite drink is a sweetened version of the blueberry martini. the best part is your bartenders know so well we hardly have to speak in order to order because they know us and want to meet our experience the best possible. probably what makes the facility the best are their bartenders.  we personally have to favorites forgive me for not knowing their names however when is a gentleman with the beard another is a young lady with blond hair that she ties in a braid and bun.   the reason i gave this rating of four instead of five is simply because i think the restaurant should attempt to relate to a younger crowd   while the regular menu is a little pricey, the happy hour menu is quite affordable. this is the time to draw in a younger crowd maybe 3045. since the  restaurant is attached to a mall, this should be a pretty simple task to accomplish especially with the chandelier ambience.   the happy hour should be a main push and should be well advertised outside of the restaurant. finally, the front door girl is very charming, but her role has little to do other than to open the door and seat the very few customers that come in.  she probably should have some other tasks to do to draw in business or maintain the restaurant. additionally, she must stand at the front near the door behind a desk on a rubber mat. during the times that she is not seating customers a stool would be a more conducive work environment for her.  she could wipe down menus, use ipads and walk around to take customer service surveys from guests, she could fold forks into napkins so that the bartending staff wouldnt be responsible for such duties.  she is wonderful and hardworking dont get me wrong but having her stand on a rubber mat just doesnt seem right. this is an awesome restaurant and it can be made fantabulous  and a 5 with a few tweaks. thanks larsons we enjoy visiting you!
first of all, let me say the food was amazing!!!! my friend and i had the 8 ounce filet, hers with sweet potato waffle fries and mine with asparagus. the steak was buttery and melted in my mouth. we also shared a bottle of wine. there was live piano singing. our server was amazing.  all through dinner he poured our wine and checked on us frequently. it was after dinner that we were disappointed. as soon as we finished eating, we felt like we were being pushed out of our seats. our server even said to us that we could finish drinking at the bar!  we still had wine in our bottle and the place was empty! he hovered over us and made us very uncomfortable until we left. we spent almost 200 for dinner. we just wanted to relax! i still give them four stars because the food. i hope this was a fluke because this was a very nice restaurant.
2nd times a charm. the management and restaurant team went above and beyond to ensure our experience was flawless. the food was top notch as well as the service. i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great food without having to drive to the strip. the atmosphere is great and the restaurant is very well designed. the menu offers a very diverse selection of food that is prepared to perfection. give larsens a try.
solid upscale place to get great protein not in a casino. yes it is attached to a mall but once you enter you will be impressed with the space and the ambiance. wood and stone and dressed up staff. i went on sat night and it was not that crowded. had prime rib and even though more medium than my medium rare i ordered it was a great piece of beef served with choic of side. i picked asparagus. done well with a little char. had the flemings salad to start and highly recommend. bartender was pleasant, attentive but respectful as i had my eyes on a football game. for this rea of town one of the better choices for a place to eat without the casino feel.
the steaks and the sea bass were great. the 4 of us were very pleased. two of us live in sacramento and this was our best meal in the las vegas area.
great happy hour in a beautiful environment: piano indoors or fire pits outdoors, either are stunning!
outdoor patio real nice and relaxing...and romantic....went for happy hour. kind of pricey. had the fish tacos...not the best and way too much for happy hour  9 for 2...good service.
lured over here by bethanys review, i came for a date night with my guy and was pleasantly surprised to see this upscale steakhouse spot attached to the galleria mall complete with valet parking.filet mignon sashimi: surprisingly tasty and imaginative! i have no idea why this spot has sushi on their menu, but this dish bridges the sushi and steak offerings in a clever way with a seared presentation served on a mountain of wasabi potatoes. i enjoyed this way more than i thought i would.chop salad: generous portion, easily sharable. toppings include garbanzo beans, tomatoes, cheese, bacon maple glazed and spiced with cayenne?, and avocado. herb crusted roasted chicken breast: despite coming here based on a review for the stuffed chicken breast, i ended up opting for this version. the mushroom cream sauce is delicious, i just wish there was more of it. portion is huge, given sides are wild rice and glazed carrots. i subbed the mac for the rice since that dish is rarely remarkable anywhere. the carrots were tasty but the glaze gets into every other component and adds an unnecessary maple sweetness to everything it touches. maybe side these separately.five cheese macaroni: an indulgent baked version with penne pasta, ample creamy sauce included. im not generally a fan of baked macs because they tend to be dry, but this version was exceptional. ny strip steak: because you gotta order at least one steak at a steak house. got the wetaged at the suggestion of our server, it was nicely crusted and cooked to a perfect mediumrare. side of asparagus was tasty, sauce and other addons bleu cheese, onions, mushrooms, etc. are unnecessary. meat was super tender and full of flavor.we were so full even with takeout boxes that we opted against dessert, but they have a large selection. they offer halfoff wine by the bottle on wednesdays, which we may have to come back to try. note that they also have a selection of wine on tap! service from neil was attentive and knowledgeable, with plenty of suggestions request him specifically.tip: they have a piano hour their version of hh with app and drink specials on the patio, lounge, and bar area. worth a shot for light bites.
i enjoyed my recent trip here very much. it is a  kind of restaurant, but nice jeans are acceptable. we started out with a crunchy lobster roll, and it was ok. had way too much of a rice wrap than it should and much less of the inside ingredients, which was a let down. i would not get again. the star if the show here was the 16oz dry aged rub rib eye. it was truly amazing,and probably the best steak i have ever tasted.  55, with one side included. my wife ordered that and i had the sea bass 38 white sticky rice and asparagus included. it was also very delicious, and well cooked. we had the pumpkin cheesecake for dessert which was still partially frozen, and nothing special. our waiter neal was excellent. the only thing i would mention was he listed all the specials and their preparation off so fast, they all ran together and out of probably 6 or so i only remembered two. he sounded like that fed ex guy on the commercial. we went early and there were only a few tables on this sat night. we will definitely be back because the entrees were exceptional.
i wanted to bring a friend and coworker out for a food steak while here in vegas, staying in henderson and found larsons through yelp.  very enjoyable, dry aged ribeye, nice silverado cab!  service was great with starla!  will return again!
after many years of cooking thanksgiving dinner at home we decided to go out to eat this year. larsens was open at 3:00 pm so we made reservations for an early dinner. we were greeted as we walked in by the two very nice hostesses and sat at a booth. the restaurant was pretty dead, just a couple other tables occupied. i really like the decor and ambiance at larsens. it is decorated with lots of wood and stone and dark colors. they also have a beautiful bar with all the liquor bottles color coordinated. our server michael arrived to explain the thanksgiving dinner special as well as the other menu items. michael provided us with outstanding service throughout the dinner, a really top notch server. the thanksgiving dinner special was either ham or turkey that came with mashed sweet potatoes, stuffing, vegetables and cranberry sauce. it also included a dessert for only 34.95. it sounded like a great deal, however the actual portions of turkey and ham were very small,we started off with a ceasar and a chopped salad, both split which was no problem at all. the split size was actually plenty and the salads were both very good. we all opted for the thanksgiving special. when it arrived i was pretty surprised at how small the portions were, hence the 34.95 price. it was one small dry slice of ham and one small slice of turkey that was actually pretty good. the mashed sweet potatoes were luke warm as were the vegetables and meat. the stuffing arrived shortly after the dinners and it was really good and served hot. for dessert three of us had the pecan pie and my mom had apple pie ala mode. the pie pieces were very big, presented beautifully and most importantly were delicious. michael continued to check on us and make sure our glasses were always full. overall it was a really nice meal, especially since i didnt have to cook it or clean up! i will be returning to larsens to try out their steaks very soon.
ran into this restaurant. so glad we did. started with the lobster roll, which seemed a bit pricy; however, when the roll was served, it was very large. i had the chopped salad, which could have had a little fresher greens. some pieces had brown edges. not what i would expect at this caliber restaurant.  we split the tritip mushroom soup. it was delicious.  my husband had the cobb salad, which was very large. the restaurant is beautiful. the service very professional and attentive. there is a nice private dining room for small groups. i will definitely eat here again.
woot woot!we attend one of the thank galleria its friday event in october.  with our 10 of galleria gift cards, we headed over to larsens with excitement in our hearts and plenty of booze in our bellies.  my understanding is that larsens is related to flemmings.  you tell by the quality and price!.  this is no ordinary evening out.  you will want to savoy each and every bite.  come hungry and leave fulfilled.  i had an amazing piece of meat and husband had a burger because he cannot appreciate filet mignon.  i see a bright future for this establishment in the crowded restaurant corridor of galleria at sunset.
had carnitas tacos. they were crispy and had a good flavor.  carne asada tacos were good too. would definitely go back
good prices, good food. we ordered to go fish taco, mini carnitas taco and carne asada torta.  they were all good and flavorful, but the two complaints was that they forgot the sauce on fish taco and the ratio of meat to bread on the torta was off.  good bread, but too much bread for the quantity of delicious carne asada. i still will definitely go back again and try some other things on menu. another thing, manny is a cool dude. he has customer service skills.
these tacos are amazeballsive been searching for a taco place that satisfies all of my taco needstaste, location, price  i think i found iti thought there were no decent taco places in the nw  the chain one just dont cut it for me but i found this place here on yelp,  the reviews sold me, i wish i wouldve known about it sooneri cant wait to try the rest of the menu which sounds delicious
tres bonne place avec une belle terrasse. le service etait tres agreable et tres efficace. le jour de notre visite, il y avait peu de monde mais beaucoup de serveuse. le brunch a ete tres bon, nous avons passe du bon temps.
great brunch place with tons of seating. they have outdoor seating as well as a smaller back room. the waitresses are super nice, and their menu is extensive. basically eggs however you want. i had the eggs benedict complete with ham, swiss and mushrooms. it was a ton of food, plus homefries on the side and a healthy portion of fruit. a great hangover cure, to be sure. also had a nice glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. perfect for getting you ready for a day of heavy drinking!
as part of our stay in edinburgh, we had a couple of days of take away from mughal. both were collection only and they were spot on with regards to timing on both occasions. nice pacakages and good gesture of slipping in chutney and poppadoms with bulk orders.they have a wide variety in main course and some decent starters. however, they would need to improve a little bit on quality of food prepeared so as to bring in authentic indian taste. i do understand that this is an indian take away in uk and should cater to british taste buds but adding a pinch of salt or turmeric wont hurt much and adds to overall favour.
first time here, great concept. picture sports bar without noise and sports . great fresh food prepared as needed. beer on tap and unusual offerings. homemade jalapeno s. i really wish these folks the best . nice people, great service. more visits and this could earn 5 stars in my book.
interesting casual dining concept. overall the fried chicken is good, the sides are ok. restaurant is nice, time from order to service is slow but perhaps thats just opening pains. the menu is however a little expensive for fast casual food. party of 3 adults, only 2 sides and 3 soft drinks was 60, seems disproportionately high. chicken portions were good, large sides are small for the price paid.
i am a fried chicken enthusiast. i love love loveeee fried chicken!! i ordered the 2 piece tenders and it wasnt so bad. i love honey and ketchup, so every bite i took had those sauces drenched on the chicken. the only reason why i didnt give them five stars is because i think its overpriced. my two piece tenders came with fries and coleslaw with no drink. it was 9.75. any extra sides that you wanna order is 3.75 for a smallpretty expensive to me. the adobo corn was a side and that was only okay. im still willing to come back to try more items from their menu, but i dont know if itll be frequent visits due to their prices.
great food.. i ate there for the soft opening.. the price seems high. but the chicken is full size.
the chicken sandwich was very good as was the corn. i also enjoyed the white chocolate strawberry shake. while the food was good, i thought it was pretty pricey at 23.00. it wont keep me away, just sayn.
heard quite a bit of hype around this spot so i threw it on my todo list as soon as it opened. i always hear about blue ribbons fried chicken but cant bring myself to ordering chicken at a pricey sushi joint. came in on 713 and honestly, i was a bit disappointed. overall the food, while overpriced, was pretty tasty. theyve got a nice mix of sandwiches vs. your standard fried chicken offerings. some pretty solid sides round out the mix. im a big fan of homemade pickles and theirs didnt disappoint. the two ladies taking orders could throw a smile into the mix every now and then though as there was quite a bit of attitude coming from their end. i saw there was no buffalo sauce on the tables, but there was a sign touting the homemade buffalo sauce. when i asked, the girl stared at me and said every sauce we have is on the table. thanks. weird, but thats ok. i headed back to my table to chow down.  suddenly the guy busing tables came over with my soughtafter buffalo sauce. i heard you asked for this, so i grabbed some for you. what a champ. it was delicious. honestly, its probably the best buffalo sauce ive had. this guy was actually the star of the show in regards to service. he was nice, attentive, and definitely going the extra mile. even offered to refill my water for me. hey management  this kid deserves some kudos!all in all, id rather make the trek to chicken shack in henderson than return to brfc. with that being said, if i was in the neighborhood and wanting some fried chicken love, id make another stop. ladies, share the love and stop hoarding that buffalo sauce! :
i had the chicken sandwich with the carmelized pineapple, and special sauce. my husband had the 2 piece dark. we thought it was yummy delicious! i consider myself to be a cole slaw expert, and the slaw here is one of the best that i have tried. not too sweet, and the perfect blend of celery seed. the service was great, however i think we could have been greeted with a little more enthusiasm. it was nice that they accept tips, but we didnt know until we looked at our receipt. certainly the employees deserve this.we are definately going to return. i want to try the blue chicken sandwich.
so im a huge raisin canes fan so was kinda reluctant to come here. i came here since this is literally my backyard instead of driving 30 mins round trip to canes.first of all i applaud this place for trying to be different with its dry run seasoning and unique cane sugar only soda pop... the chicken was cooked well and tasted great. the fries are awesome. your tradition skinny fries youd find in a bar. the cole slaw is different and sour style.in short, its good but growing up with canes, this places doesnt compete. the chicken needed a sauce canes sauces wouldve been great. the worst part is the price. two orders of 2 piece tenders and two drinks was 28.you get more at canes and 10 less plus better slaw, sauce, drinks, and toast bread.the man that was cleaning tables is why i gave this place a 4 star. he alone gave best only service and was very attentive. brought me ranch dressing, grabbed my forks, brought me my food, and cleaned my table when i was done. once again, good food but ill drive to canes next time.
with a little fine tuning this spot could be excellent. the first time i stopped by the tenders were soggy and oily. but on subsequent visits the wings have been crispy and the blue bird sandwich has become one of my favorite chicken sandwiches around. i like the seasoning on the tenders and wings, but remember the crust being thicker and crunchier at brooklyn bowl, which is also owned by the bromberg brothers. a kids meal only comes with one tender. i wish they used a more mild seasoning for the kids meals. my guy didnt care for the spices. while i do like this place, prices are too high for a fast casual spot to make me a frequent visitor. the 2 piece tender meal didnt fill me up and that was around 12 for the meal plus a drink. i understand the quality is higher than fast food spots, but i cant spend 15 or more on lunch on a regular basis. if i bring the family the price triples. the best bargain is the lunchbox special available mf 11am4pm which includes 5 wings, fries, and a drink.
this is some really good chicken, and i mean, really good.i originally came here on a date, and wasnt expecting much. i mean, its chicken, how good can a random chicken shop possibly be?well, the truth slapped me in the face with delicious flavours and unique but trendy side dippings cough, honey sriracha, cough. the chicken wings are nicely sized, theres a lot of meat on each chicken, and theyre always cooked to perfection. the crispy breading is undoubtedly almost on par with that of roscoes chicken and waffles.sadly, the date didnt go so well, but my fondness for this joint did, ive returned time and time again to downtown summerlin just for the chicken.i highly recommend this place to anyone who loves their chicken!
excellent fried chicken and sides.  interesting fountain soda with unique flavors.  really good service.  very pricey.
best fried chicken ive ever had! i like my skin crispy and theirs was super! my mom says it reminds her of chicharone. it was well seasoned and very flavorful. my wife and i both agree that it tastes similar to the mexican seasoning taijin. as long as i eat it fresh out the fryer, i dont even need the sauces that they have, which there are a few intersting ones to choose from, all honey based. my favorite one is not honey based i believe and its the habenero. i got the 2 boneless thighs and it came with so much fries that i still have left overs from saturday. they were skinny and seasoned just right. the soda fountain wasnt typical. they had flavors like black cherry and cream soda. reminds me of my younger days. it wasnt  the normal sitdown, but the attendant there gave excellent service. he already knew what we needed, sometimes even before we knew it, lol! as long as this place is consistent and  with no more incidents like on the picture of another yelper  here, then i would highly recommend this place and stay a loyal patron.
fried chicken is amazing!! best place to cure the fried chicken craving if you want something more than churches or popeyes. dont let the 8 lunch fool you, its a lot of a food!!
as far as crispy chicken sandwiches go, this place turns out a very solid one. buns are great, breading is light and the sauces are great. loved that each table has squeeze bottles of flavored honey the wasabi honey was a surprise favorite and bbq sauce. i got the original blue ribbon sandwich 6.50, i think. you can make it a combo with fries  coleslaw for an additional 2.50. the serving of fries is very generous and they were shoestring cut and very crispy. the coleslaw had quite a bit of vinegar in it. i love slaw but it wasnt my personal fav. the dining room was nice, inviting and really clean. there was a young guy,who brought us silverware and offered to refill out sodas, who was a 5 star employee.  cool trashing compacting garbage cans were something i have yet to see elsewhere. a solid 4 stars.
have been here a dozen times... food is consistently good and service is always great. my only complaint is the cost  its ridiculously overpriced. two of us usually have a chicken sandwich, fries and salad with a soda and its over 30. but theres a reason we keep going back.
i got the lunchbox special. five wings and a mess of shoestring fries. the chicken was the typical 2parter with the drumette. small but not tiny. crispy without being greasy, and nicely seasoned. the fries were also tasty and they give you a ton. i like that they sell boyland sodas although they are missing the birch beer. definitely a nice lunch for under 10.
when i took a bite into your chicken sandwich i actually closed my eyes and took a deep breath. it was perfect. then when i thought it couldnt get any better i took a sip from my soda and smiled. it was a huge difference from the usual cokepepsi products. my only call out is that everything was a little more expensive than most, but the flavors and youre great service make me forget about that.
first off you get a lot of food at this place.  we could have done with half the fries.  the chicken was juicy and cooked just right, we had the 2 piece thigh.  one thing i thought was really cool was the boylan soda dispenser, something different than pepsi or coke.  the cream soda was awesome!  we will be back.
such a great place to eat in the summerlin area!my girlfriend and i went here because we tried this place out at life is beautiful and their chicken drew me towards them. the sauce was out of this world and i had to have more! so we finally got some time to drive over there since i live in bfe from them and it was totally worth it! we came in close to closing but all the workers there didnt mind at all and were still very helpful. they came around to the table to ask if we needed anything like a refill or to throw away things and i thought that was a great way to keep the relationship with the customers fresh and friendly. the sugar cane soda there always a sight for sore eyes! actual sugar in these sodas and i loved it. cream soda and root beer were the best for me. lastly the food was just as i expected, beautifully hand crafted chicken made from the blue ribbon gods. the selection of sauce made it even better. chipotle honey sauce was hands down my favorite. the shoe string fries on top of that is beautiful! my favorite shoe string fries anywhere! the only drawback i can think of is its a bit pricey when it comes to getting meals for families. if you buy a burger alone, its worth it. but for a family, the ball park range is 50. so i suggest coming here for yourself and 1 other person, unless you eat as much of a 3 person family then i recommend somewhere a bit cheaper for this price. if you are in the mood for some great chicken at a reasonable price, i highly recommend it. the chicken is worth it alone, imo in my opinion
i had heard rave reviews of this fried chicken so we finally made it in for lunch! surprisingly, it was very quiet for a saturday afternoon at dt summerlin. we were pleasantly surprised that beers were 2 for 1 during games. we arent sports fans but we are fans of free beer! i had a chicken sandwich, while hubby had a 2 piece meal and our little had a chicken tender kids meal. it was a lot of food and reasonably priced. was this chicken delicious and juicy? yes! was it life changing? no. but tasty nonetheless. the different honey options were a fun touch. we had great service. they checked on us often and met our every need. surprising for a place with counter service. i would certainly return for a scrumptious lunch or an ultra casual dinner.
good stuff!  as i suspected, any negative comments here must be from those who dont like fried foods period. this chicken is very crisp and not greasy at all. its a little non traditional in its style, i.e. the thighs are filleted, but i like that because it gives more crispy surface area. the wings are not traditional as they are not coated in sauce, but they provide a nice assortment of sauces at the table. service was very good. bright airy environment, i will definitely be back many times.
wow! this place is so damn good! i love the fried chicken  fries. too bad it is so far from home. great customer service, friendly staff, mellowchill environment. havent had any issues with this place.
when i saw this open  i was really excited. growing up in the south i love a good fried chicken. blue ribbon uses a less is more approach. the breading is really light but definitely gives it a great crunch while letting the actual chicken shine thru. they also dust the freshly fried chicken with a spice rub of sorts and it definitely adds to it. i have to say i knew that i was in good hands when i saw the most of their sauces where honey based. and the wasabi honey was a welcomed surprise. also the service was great. they where fast and really welcoming and.so why the 4 instead of the 5? 2 things. the sandwich was pretty hard to eat and it really just fell apart. plus the other parts of the sandwich aside from the chicken itself where pretty standard. iceberg lettuce and a tomato. mehh. the sauce was great though. overall nicely done blue ribbon. will i be back? absolutely. i just wont get the sandwich.
i had the blue ribbon sandwich and very much enjoyed it!  the sandwich was very tasty and the ingredients were very fresh.  there are some great honey sauces that are offered at the restaurant that go great with the chicken. the staff was impeccable especially for this style restaurant.  i would definitely go back!
i had a firebird sandwich combo and i found it to be pretty good. really big juicy chicken pieces and i love shoe string fries. the coleslaw is a little on the picklelyside but that might help out in case you order something spicy.
went here on a sunday to try their sandwich of the month, the chicken gobbler! its like the bobbi at caps but with chicken and mashed potatoes instead of turkey and mayo. the sandwich was yummy, everything works well together. my only criticism is that the sandwich was very messy to eat even after slicing it in half and i think a big reason why is because they put mashed potatoes wgravy both on top of the chicken strips and underneath. i didnt order any fries, but one of the managers was kind enough to bring some with my meal which i greatly appreciated! i forgot what brand of soda they use but i like the change from pepsi and coke and that they use cane sugar vs corn syrup. another thing i liked was their silver trash compactors although when i put my food in it it didnt seem to compact. either way, it impressed me as trash is usually an afterthought and companies will get the same designs we see over and over.
ive stayed away from this place like the plague because of the notsoflattering yelp photo of the undercooked chicken displayed prominently on their yelp page. when shake shack finally opened up and i saw the infamous restaurant right across the street, the smell of fried chicken and happy patrons lured me over. my husband and i finally went in i never told him about the raw chicken so he could go in unbiased, and we were greeted warmly by the cashier. i didnt catch his name, but this guy was on top of his stuff  greeting, taking orders, serving orders, cleaning up tables, checking in on customers, all without a hitch imo. he gave us great recommendations  he said get the wings and get the creme soda, and thats exactly what im going to do now every time i come here ive been dying to come back since my first visit. the bbq chicken sandwich we got was just okay and kind of soggy, so i really do think the wings are the best way to enjoy the chicken here. i loved the chipotle honey sauce and the wildflower honey. it reminds me of the chicken and honey at brooklyn bowl, without having to drive down to the strip. their thin cut fries are addicting and i liked dipping them in the chipotle honey sauce as well. my husband opted for the gravy fries  which i thought were good, but soggy, but he loved them. i dont even like creme soda, but the brand they use here is a musthave! they also have tvs if youd like to catch a game here. not the ideal setup for game watching, but it does the job. my advice  give this place a chance, you might be pleasantly surprised.
ill start out with that your in dts, so your gonna pay a little more than usual. this place is worth it though. the chicken was excellent. it did not taste like premade frozen chicken strips. this chicken tasted like they just breaded it and dropped it in the fryer. the chicken wings were also very good. there is a variety of different sauces and honey available on the tables. the only thing i did not care for was the fresh garlic in the hot sauce. i love garlic, but not in my hot sauce.you definitely have to stop by and give this place a try. good food!!
have you been waiting for belfiores to reopen?  forget it, they arent, but dinos has opened in its place!  we went there tonight and tried the pizza, salad, bread, ravioli, eggplant parmesan and veal parmesan....all were great.  the service was friendly and prompt. the prices are very affordable.  they have a bakery too.the wait is over!
everything we had was great! heard about this place from some friends and we tried it out. will be back for sure.
i used to be a customer of belfiore, the prior italian restaurant at  this location.  i was really fond of belfiore and this goto place created a void for me when it closed.  so i really wanted to like its replacement.the place looks better than it did before but considering the amount of time it took to reopen, i expected more of a transformation.  it is clean, freshly painted, old bar gone and an inordinately large bussing area added.  some pictures on the wall, but nothing to deliberately add anything meaningful to the decor. the bakery is almost sparse of baked goodsjust a few trays of cookies, but no slices of cakes or pastries one might expect in an italian bakery. we were served complimentary hot bread  butter.  we couldnt decide at the table whether it was good or not, but i thought it was.  later on when they brought another seeded roll, it was agreed that the seeded bread was really good.  entrees came with small salads consisting of iceberg lettuce, one slice of tomato, thinly chopped black olives and one pepperocini pepper.  everybody loved that little pepper.  the salad was mundane but it was nice of them to offer one with the entree. ordered fettucini alfredo, eggplant parmagiana which came with spaghetti and one order of chicken cutleteggplant combination without cheese also came with spaghetti.  we were so impressed with the portions when they arrivedexcept for the fettucini alfredo.  although it was just pasta no meat or veggies in it, the portion seems awfully small for a pasta dish.  in addition, salt had to be added to it to make it edible.  somebody under salted the pasta water.  very important when making pasta  i also noticed that the pasta was not drained properly which caused the alfredo sauce to become watery.  other than that the other two dishes were very good.  hubby was really happy with the eggplantchicken combination and i was happy with the eggplantreally nicely prepared.  frankly, for me the red sauce was not stellar but it was enough to satisfy most pallets, including my husbands.the service was attentive throughout the meal. dinos is a place where we will be returning if they could just get that fettucini alfredo under control.
i have to admit that i was a fan of  regular customer of belfiore, so when they closed i was left with a serious void for good italianamerican neopolitan style food. but we decided to try dinos today after curiosity got the best of us. i have to say theyve done a nice job on the interior. clean, fresh, new refrigerated cases and italian groceries like cento san mazzano tomatoes. currently, the pastry cases  bread shelves are a little bare, but hopefully, that will change in time.we ordered a 16 pie with mushrooms to take home. while i wasnt entirely crazy about the red sauce they use, the crust was crispy and very well done. the cheese was hot and perfectly melted and good quality. best part were the mushrooms, generously sprinkled on the pizza, and fresh. you could actually taste the earthiness and depth. impressive. all too often mushrooms on pizzas are tasteless slivers tossed on a pizza as a second thought. if it wasnt for the sauce being closer to a marinara, id give it 5 stars for being a perfect ny style pizza. as it is, it was pretty close. well be back for sure. im already anticipating trying the italian beef or beef on weck.
new italian place, seems to still be trying to get its legs.  we went in to check out the bakery  a bit sparse given all the space they have, but they do have several items to choose from.  before grabbing a dessert, we sat down for pizza and wings.  everyone else was ordering pasta and other dishes, so felt a bit odd.  but the wings were great, a nice crispy deep fry with just the right amount of sauce.  pizza was good, but nothing to rave about.  we grabbed a cannoli to go after  it was good, but not quite the taste im used to having... it had too much of something, perhaps a touch too much vanilla extract?  anyways, im gonna give this place the benefit of the doubt and will probably stop in to give another try.  would like to see em really get up and going.
tried this new place because i was craving pasta and sausage. checked out their menu on their website. great prices. we were greeted by trish. she is a gem. 8.95 for pasta, sausage, salad and bread. great meal for the price. trish showed us some yummy looking desserts but we were too full. i was kicking myself an hour later that i didnt bring one home. ill definitely go back. happy to have a solid place within walking distance.
second time and a major improvement in our total dining experience.  not only was the wait staff now knowledgeable, but they were genuinely warm and friendly.  but we are after all here to eat.  the salad which was pathetic on our first visit, was larger, lettuce crisp and dry, color provided by tomato, cucumber and pepprocini.  my soup was a tad salty but had great flavor and full of veggies and pasta. i almost always have linguini and clam sauce, but tonight ordered veal parm.  excellent!  they accommodated my wife by mixing and matching her specific requests to bring her a new version of chicken angelo.  all in all we had a great meal and will definitely be back sooner than later
ive taken my moms toyota here several times and have had good service. theres a kids play area, barber,  comfy seats while you wait. the lobby has wifi along with complimentary coffee, bottled water,  fruit.
i have used big two toyota scion of chandler for service on my toyota tacoma, and i would have to say that their service is top notch.  when i dropped off my truck i was immediately greeted and my service represenative james came out within 3 minutes to walk around the vehicle and confirm the appointment i had.i was not hassled for any additional service, just the service i requested and when they did notice something needed replacing they called me immediately and worked with me on the price for the part.  i think james is a straight shooter and he only wants to make his customers happy and ensure that we are getting the best service possible.  i use big two toyota scion of chandler for their location to my house and for the ease of dropping off and getting on my way.  i have never been hassled by the salesman, even when i look at the new vehicles in the showroom when waiting to pick up my car.i really like the ammenities inside the showroom that you can utilize if you decide to wait for your vehicle.  the free coffee, water and wifi are great if you just want to hang out and wait.  i have not tried the barber shop or massage that they offer, so i may have to give that shot the next time i am there.i will definitely give big two toyota scion of chandler a strong look when i am in the market for a new car or truck.
after a less than acceptable experience over the weekend with the service department i wanted to write an update to explain the attempts that chris the service manager made to correct my issues. he addressed my issues in a professional manner  even when i was less than professional due to my emotion getting the best of me  and went over and above to make sure i was happy after the initial issues i experienced with the service department. i wont go into the details in what he did but it was much more than i would have expected from them to right the wrongs. it is good to know that in this day and age my concerns were heard and dealt with in a manner where i felt that the issues werent just ignored. i feel that i can give 4 of 5 stars in my review. the only reason i cant give 5 is due to the fact that there was an issue that in my opinion needed to be escalated in the first place.
have had my new toyota tundra serviced here since day one.  i have had very good service from the service team at big two.  they have explained the work carefully and get the service done in a very reasonable timeframe.  check in process is painless and they have a wifi lounge a snack bar and places for the kids to play pretty awesome play area in case you want to wait for your vehicle.
ive been working with adam rodriguez in the service department since i purchased my vehicle in 2011.  hes a stand up guy.  the service i receive is excellent and the online appointment making is a total time saver, too.  ive always been treated with respect and as i usually make an early morning appointment i love getting a free cup of coffee and then adam will set me up with a free massage or pedicure next door.  yes, their prices are higher but my car is under warranty and ive had no issues with it at all. they take great care of me and when i leave i feel safe and im not ever worried that my car is going to breakdown.  that you cant put a price on.
went to check it out since last time i saw it was being albertsons. it was about lunch time so i decided to head for the deli to get a sandwich. they still had some equipment missing toaster oven but i got pretty decent sandwich after all. everything was fresh and tasted good. produce area is really good. i found some good deals on mangoes 1.29 each for organic is not bad at all. overall not a bad choice for grocery shopping. i wish haggens luck in a local market.
prices are a little steep however love the fresh made daily fruit bowls and salads. cinnamon buns are to die for and bakery products the best of any chain ive ever been too. plus they have products you cant find anywhere else in southern nevada. the store reminds me of a cross between sprouts and traders joes and is  only going to get better imo
i live about five minutes from here and im so glad to see more businesses opening here in downtown instead of those dreaded condos. ive never been to the old location so i dont have a way to compare the two. in any case, its a nice wide open space with a huge selection. the only thing wrong are the prices. egads. i saw a cute little hat and come to find out its 35. seems a little steep to me. now if this hat belonged to jackie o then you could justify the price. they have a pretty good mens selection too. i understand this is vintage but come on. well if you have a little extra money to burn then this is your place. i suppose im just an old cheapskate whod rather hunt for scraps at goodwill.
totally stumbled on this place while out with a friend and it is a gem. so many special pieces from the 20s, 30s, 40s, and beyond. as a longtime fashion lover without a lot of access to true older vintage, it was incredible to get an up close view of the level of craftsmanship and detail that went into clothes back then. they have a great selection and i think the prices are fair for the effort and love that went into 1 the clothes themselves and 2 the selection curation of the store. ill definitely be back!
we sat outside because the music was too loud inside to have a conversation without getting frustrated. the food took a bit of time to arrive; longer than i was expecting. but it was very good once it made an appearance. i had the croque madame, which was very enjoyable. the winning menu item is the scrambled egg on toast however. doesnt sound like much but when it arrived it was a veritable mountain of egginess, with two massive slabs of toast, fried flatcap mushroom and bacon on top. i had food envy. the space itself is very welcoming, with lots of tables and room upstairs also. there are lots of tables outside, for the rare summer day when you can enjoy the canal basin and sunshine. theres also a kiddies corner inside, so its great for families. suspect akva will give loudons a run for its money.
beers good. and the food is fresh and clearly homemade. i couldnt recommend this more to someone looking for a great place to eat and drink.
akva is the newest addition to the boda family and i think its quite good. similar to hemma in size, its massive though with slightly less charm. food is, as you would expect, on par with other boda locations with something for most budgets. the real winner here is the beer garden out back which is right on the canal and gets some great sunshine.most importantly for me, its very child friendly. they have a load of high chairs and its total mummy central in the afternoons. the size contributes to how excellent this is as it makes it absolutely pram friendly as well. akva is the newest example of the gentrification of the lothian rd area and im definitely into it.
we have been here a few times and are never disappointed. its literally at the end of the union canal and a huge sun catcher. there is a big beer garden to enjoy nice sunny days outside. there are also 2 designated play areas for children. stocked up with toys and a wee kitchen with pots and pans, perfect for any toddler. my toddler definitely approved.the food is spot on. we ordered a side a chips which was huge  super tasty. i am almost positive these chips are freshly cut, which is a big plus!  we also ordered the croque monsieur which is one tasty and big dish. right on the money! also they have very tasty fresh baked cakes! what else could you ask for? great food, great views, beautiful beer garden with canal  ducks at your doorstep. its a lovely day out.
the classic association between old mobsters and retro vegas finally gets a good turn. situated in the classic el cortez, bugsy siegal gets a reworking as an inexpensive retro restaurant.we were there for their second night, very near a couple who sent their order all back; the man had a steak he didnt like it cut and ran nicely in front of me, the lady had overcooked vegetables. we had the burgers: delivered on better than average lightly floured buns with sauted onions, a nice deal for about eight bucks! you have to give places time to shake out the kinks; maybe we just got lucky. burgers, fries, slaw, sodas: badabing.the soundtrack was vintage; the score is understated and nicely done. its a lot safer than anything in the downtown area, so relax there; its a spot that you wont overpay at, and more power to 1941 for bringin on pastrami, a reuben and easy eats.ps: i know some locals are pissed about the old diner goin out and a slick mobster eatery goin in. i get that, but downtowns infamous for chancy chow; siegals 1941 is hip and pretty damn good.
if it were possible i wouldve given siegels 1941 4.5 stars. as of this visit, siegels is 4days new and the food was spectacular. definitely not the the same old vegas manufactured garbage. ribeye steak was perfectly done and the lasagna was clearly house made. would be a steal at 30 higher price.
perhaps the most aspiring downtown hotel dining project in recent memory, and one that instantly sparked interest given the 247 concept within the historic el cortez, it was with three friends that a fourcourse feast was enjoyed at siegels 1941, the sizeable space and immense menu showing promise of great things to come despite only officially being open for five days at the time of our midmorning arrival.inspired by bugsy siegel, an early investor in the el cortez, with a soundtrack that veers vintage as rat pack classics float beneath gilded ceilings overhead, siegels 1941 features several touches harkening the era for which it is themed and with virginia hill gazing on over wood and red leather the menu is widereaching with breakfast, allday, and latenite versions offered depending on the time, the transition from breakfast occurring at 11:00am proving the impetus for the partys 10:15am reserved table.managed by scott farber and conceptualized by esplv, a design group behind several local restaurants with varying degrees of value, it would seem obvious that a concept as aggressive as sigels 1941 would be marred by a few issues in its opening days, and fully admitting that staffkitchen transitions are one of those kinks it was nodoubt a pleasant surprise that saw scott diligently looking over his team throughout the stay, a middleaged hispanic woman providing almost universally impressive service given the complex coursing of the order, while a few kitchen delays and errors in execution seemed a bit more egregious  the chicken sent in place of requested eggplant, while a side of meatballs was instead served as the spaghetti centered entree with a whole lot of watery noodles eventually going to waste.beginning with breakfast, a few cups of coffee as well as orange juice, milk, plus a cocktail all brought along with water with refills rarely requiring a request, course one saw four plates delivered and while the flaccid pancakes with a simple spread of nutella could have benefitted from a bit more imagination both the chicken and waffles beneath peppery sausage gravy and the challah french toast were as good as any served within a local diner, the use of 100 pure maple syrup a definite highlight, as was the quality of housemade corned beef acting to anchor a hash that featured goldenbrown potatoes and lightly seared red peppers alongside a pair of poached eggs.designating round two as the sandwich course, it was on the advice of eatinglv that the citys best cuban was ordered, and served with fries on a silver tray one would be hard pressed to argue with such an assessment, particularly as relates to authenticity, as each ingredient melded nicely between layers of toasty pressed bread, the monte cristo equally tasty and loaded with ham despite missing an opportunity to be the only deepfried version currently offered in sin city while the carolina pulled pork was unfortunately quite dreadful, a total lack of vinegar in either the pig or the slaw not at all resembling the stuff served in the southeast while the bun was a soggy mess mere seconds after arrival.receiving repeat apologies for a delay that stretched just under forty minutes at the midpoint of the meal, it was almost as though the extra time only served to confuse the kitchen since the aforementioned mistakes were sent out despite being correctly listed on the ticket, but thankfully not meeting any harboring a distaste for animal flesh as the enormous chicken parmesan was an exceedingly high quality rendition with light breading and good sauce while meatballs were unfortunately a bit dry and almost entirely devoid of spice, the pot pie undoubtedly proving a far more worthwhile bite as golden puff pastry formed a buttery dome over a creamy potage chockablock full of chicken and vegetables that outdid many more expensive versions found elsewhere in sin city.not yet dialing in the dessert menu, and as such unable to offer the strawberry ice box pie while also admitting that breakfast pastries are currently brought in from an outside source, the meal conclude with a duo of bread pudding and turtle pie, the former a dense block of brioche swimming in bourbon infused sauce beneath slowly melting ice cream while the later was an absolute mustorder for those fancying caramel or chocolate, the filling a spoton rendition of the inspirational candy with a graham cracker crust crisp too the tooth and heavy with spice.already rivaling anything downtown for 24hour fare, and only likely to get better with time, siegels 1941 is the sort of retrorebrand that places such roxys at the stratosphere have long aspired to emulate  a place where tourists and locals alike can get a good meal at a fair price, all while experiencing the oldschool vegas vibe that flows throughout its longest continuously running hotel and gaming space.
a combo coffee house and steak house is what they are going for.  i had breakfast here and it was very good. service was good. they got the drinks and food out quickly. the only issue was a bit slow on the check.as for the food it is not a cheap dinner but that is not what they are going for.   the omelet was huge and very tasty. the potatoes were good and bread fresh.  i liked it.  will update if i come back for a steak
if vegas is about having fun, then this was fun.  restaurant is new and trending without being pretentious.  menu was old school comfort foods matzoh ball soup but with some nice twists.  wish my appetite was bigger.we had corned beef on rye and a meyer lansky burger a pastrami topping.  i thought service was just right. loved the whole vibe of restaurant and casino
service was good. newly remodeled. had the lasagna and wife had filet mignon. we both really enjoyed our meals except for the side salad.
got ten bucks? want a slab of prime rib with the fixins for the price of a big mac combo? this place. go here. even if the waiter moves in slow motion. even if the semicreepy mural of a long ago murdered mafioso emblazened on the walls around you stares and wont stop staring. go here. eat and feel like you got one over on the system. au jus and horse radish on the side? yes please. giant slab of butter on two steamed huge chucks of broccoli? sure! the prime rib is thick cut and substantial. unlike the the number on the check. score.
inconsistency is the name of the game here. portions are generous, quality is above standard coffee shop fare, and service can sometimes be amazing. but combining good food and good service appears to be a struggle to get the balance right. sticks to burgers, salads, and the daily specials for a worthwhile visit.
decided to try out siegels after discovering the cafe was closed. found the service to be on par and friendly,  albeit a little slow.  nice and pleasant atmosphere like the mobster vibe.ordered the lucky luciano burger which was cooked to a nice medium with marinara sauce, mozzarella on a ciabatta roll.  italian all the way; appropriate for a burger named after a mobster. liked that it was served on a metal traylike in the joint haha. was really disappointed by the very small sized wings; 10 is a bit steep considering they werent even very good. overall, a pretty good experience and will stop back when at the el cortez.
so happy that on this trip back to my favorite casino and dinning at siegels 1941 they have improved and have ironed out all the kinks that had my visit last time!  the service was good the food fabulous as usual i have prime rib  it was on point!  my new lunch favorite is the seared ahiso onodlish!  the best part of it all was everything was hot and cooked perfectly!!! thank you siegels for the experience and i cant wait to return in january!!
i had heard some good things about this fairly new rendition of the dining premises at the el cortez hotel that had formerly been the flame, and finally visited to find out for myself.  while less upscale than its predecessor, the decor is still classy and now moboriented, and the more casual menu is now the very embodiment of comfort food.a gulf shrimp cocktail was quite tasty and the equal of this classic starter at many other fine restaurants in town.  and a bowl of matzo ball soup was really hot and excellent.  after i began attacking this concoction, i was ambivalent about having ordered it at all, becausechockful of chicken, carrots, and celerythis dish was really more an entree than a preliminary adjunct to another main course.  in the midst of the steaming broth was a large, nice and fluffy matzo ball, but the soup also came with challah jewish homebaked bread that was unfortunately dry and did not taste at all fresh.  a house salad tasted good, and a generous portion of country fried steak with mashed potatoes and country gravy was delectable and comforting.  all others at my table liked their ordered food as well.the decor, with big blowups of bugsy on walls, was pleasant and somewhat historical.  and, while our waitress was rather stern and slow, our busboy provided good service.     i will be back soon to try other tempting offerings!
ive tried to go here twice and both times they were closed. there was a note on the door saying there was an equipment malfunction but that note has been on the door for over a week now.  i dont do corporate places ever so i was looking forward to this place but its annoying to drive all the way there just to see that stupid note on the door. they shouldnt have opened their doors without working out all the kinks.ok....so i went back for the free donuts today and i thoroughly enjoyed them. we tried the bacon maple and the salted caramel and they were both delicious! we also tried both the iced teas, green and black...also great. the people behind the counter were very sweet and accommodating. i always support local businesses and although i cant imagine being a regular  at a donut shop, i will definitely try this place again!
four stars so close to five because there are no gluten free options yet... but yolo and all that stuff, right? ;so i dove head first into the deep end of a bacon maple gluten vortex and i have no regrets!the reformulated dough is definitely a hit. it has a soft airy feel combined with a nice chewy texture that melts in your mouth with just a hint of salt at the end...or was that bacon?combined with the hand crafted latte with fresh brewed espresso made by a girl with a dragon tattoo it truly was the breakfast of champions!ok, maybe thats a stretch, but it was a seriously great donut, and combined with the craft coffee it made for a lovely treat enjoyed with my wife and 35 of our closest friends who weve never met...
unlike some of the other reviewers our selections were cooked properly.  not only that but they were some of the better executed glazed donuts weve had in the valley. yes there are a few kinks to work out, namely the fact they need cake donuts and a better variety, but they are a welcome addition to a community in need of donut made with an artisans care.
love eating local and born  glazed looks like it may be a fixture n scottsdale if my first stop in today is any indication. located in a strip mall, occupying the space little chicago previously occupied before they move about a half mile south down the road. had a prickly pear and chocolate cake donut. very tasty. still have a pbj and and a cinnamon roll to try. will have to have family members take over from here. will report on these selections future review and plan on trying their americano beverage on part two of review. happy to have this business on my route to work.
on appearance and customer service only. heard they have a vegan donut but they havent perfected it yet so no treats for me todaysuper sweet welcome  greeted in front of the counter instead of behind. it smelled amazing and the donuts look beautiful. the place has a mom and pop feel to it  no frills, old school counter and a classic open sign. the minimalist look tells me they focus on what matters: the donut. anxious for the release of the vegan so i can taste the goods!
wonderful cinnamon roll!i cant speak to the donuts here, but stopped in late this morning and picked up a delicious unfrosted cinnamon roll. it was perfect, just sweet enough without being too sweet, and lots of cinnamon. the frosted one looked good, but i decided to keep it simple. i warmed it up at home, and enjoyed it with a cup of coffee.this wasnt a planned stop, i just recalled that there was a donut shop in the strip mall and pulled in to discover that born  glazed i didnt immediately get the name had just opened a few months ago. the donuts looked interesting and ill probably try them in the future.my cinnamon roll was reasonably priced, at 1.79.
yeast style, with a slightly chewy, substantial texture that is not heavy. glazes tend to be very sweet, but punctuated with macerated fruit, citrus juices or herbs. they are creative and delicious. i see others talk about not liking some chewiness in these donuts, and it is totally fine to have an opinion, but dont knock somebodys process or intent for being different. i have yet to have a better donut in phoenix.
traveled 13 miles to born  glazed because my sister told me about this place. got there and it was closed without any reason or notice. we were within normal business hours. disappointed and therefor im leaving this review. even the sign on the door said theyll return at 7:50 and i assume its a.m. because the theyd be closed at that time in the p.m.  who closes up shop without notice? yelp said they were open too. updatei was surprised to receive a comment from the business owner explaining the circumstances. he was very apologetic and impressed me with his professionalism. because of this im choosing to raise my stars as im am still looking forward to trying their donuts when i return.
amazing. best donuts. flavors like prickly pear and salted caramel, dulce de leche and maple bacon were standouts. be careful not to drive past it, you cant really see the sign from the road. good chai tea latte. dude working behind the counter didnt really seem like he was in a good mood, so giving it 4 stars.
visited b  g for the first time today at around 10:15am. no line and i was greeted by a very friendly dude behind the counter. i ordered a maple bacon donut and a medium coffee. came to 5 and change. i had read a lot of negative reviews concerning the consistentcy of the donut dough. they were being described as too doughy, soft pretzel like, etc. in my opinion it there was simply nothing wrong with the dough, my donut was awesome! had i not read the reviews i do not believe i would have even taken notice of the dough consistency at all. the donut itself was delicious and rivals any gourmet donut i have had from san diego to chicago. very good. one thing i never see mentioned in the reviews is how good their coffee is! excellent coffee and i will drive out of my way to get it from now on. i will definitely be returning to b  g and would encourage anyone who likes donuts to give it a try. one issue and the only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5, it was very warm inside the store itself. either turn on the ac or prop open the front door. other than that great place! as i am writing this i wish i would have ordered two donuts.
love eating local and born  glazed looks like it may be a fixture n scottsdale if my first stop in today is any indication. located in a strip mall, occupying the space little chicago pizza previously occupied before they moved about a half mile south down the road. had a prickly pear and a chocolate cake donut. very tasty. still have a pbj and and a cinnamon roll to try. will have to have family members take over from here. will report on these selections in a future review and plan on trying their americano beverage on part two of review. happy to have this business on my route to work.this last review ,that follows  ,of this place took place 11215got here at 12:13 pm on monday. closed said would return at 7. this is the fifth time i have stopped by this donut shop. it has been open two of those attempts. i give up
ok, got a message from one of the owners. turns out they are closed the day i went by even though their yelp page said open. hope that gets fixed. went back 111315. got a mix of donuts and an americano. drink was very good. shared the donuts with co workers. the two that i talked to both stated that they were the best donut they ever had. i had one with a fantastic pumpkin icing. bueno!  what a great and different selection. keep up the great work. i will b back!!!!
we spotted zydeco on our way to the container park and couldnt wait to give it a try. the counterman let us know that theyd only been been open a week so we were happy to give them a try. we sampled the cajun turkey and a fried shrimp poboy with cajun fried and onion rings. beer, hard cider, frozen daiquiris were on the menu, but we stuck to soft drinks. service was good. its counter service, but they deliver to the table when the order is up. the sandwiches were really tastytaken up a notch with the jalapeno mayo. the turkey was cut in a generous slab and was juicy. the shrimp was good, not overly generous but not stingy either. the fries were shoestring, hot, and perfectly seasoned. the onion rings probably came out of the fryer first, so the temperature just missed, but the flavor was good i couldnt stop picking at them.the restaurant is new, clean, and unique. we really enjoyed it. the total check for three sandwiches, three drinks, one fryone ring was just under 50 tip, which we thought was fair. they just miss a fifth star for the rings, shrimp portion, and the fact that we were the only people there which could really go either way... give them a try!
we got the catfish and shrimp poboy. pretty good, the fries are great. loved the interior decor and the music.
saw this place on a top restaurants downtown list and decided to give it a try. the poboys are large enough to split. we got the debrisbrisket and fried catfish both tasty and worth the try! red beans and rice were tasty and tradition. the fries were way too salty and soggy but the onion rings were awesome! good batter and super thin and crispy. staff was nice and accommodating and the restaurant itself was clean and inviting. only about 9 tables but we came at a down time and it was just fine. definitely will come back.
experience:  came with a group of friends to try this place out. ive been holding off to go with my friends, but being a louisiana gal, i was itching to try this spot since it first opened. it was 6pm on a thursday. facility: this place is pretty small. it has about 12 seats in the front room where you order, and maybe 12 more in the second room. it has some cool louisiana decor, including the colleges banners and even some of the interstate signs. they even have a tabasco plant right on the counter. brought me right back home. and i love they put purse hooks under every seat! service:  when you enter, you order from the counter, and then they bring it out. since i was a bit early, i was asking a lot of questions, and brandon the chefowner came out and talked to me. he was super friendly and you can tell he takes pride in what he does. he had me taste a few things and talked to me about his journey to this particular restaurant. what a nice guy!!!food: there was so much i wanted to try, i was thankful one of my friends decided to order with me and split stuff so we could taste more. my standout favorites was the: catfish poboy  55  which was crispy and moist inside, which a nice flavor on the batter. onion straws  55  they were thin, slightly sweet and salty, and fried to perfection. the other things we tried...the chef had me try some of the vegetarian gumbo 4.55 and i was surprised how much flavor it had. not sure that it tasted like a traditional gumbo, but it was a damn good soup. regular gumbo  3.55  it was good, lots of meat and veggies, but im used to a gumbo with a darker roux. he is from an area southwest in louisiana, so he admitted the flavors are a little different from some of the new orleans flavors. sausage poboy 2.55  unfortunately the sausage was overcooked and very dry. the flavor was good.  the chef makes this andouille from scratch. dirty fries  35  so these were covered in cheese and sausage. they were good, but the sausage was overdone again. potato salad  25  i did not care for this much. not saying its not good, but im a southern, eggs, mayo, relish, etc kinda potato salad girl. this has a heavy brown mustard flavor. just not my thing. overall: i will come back to get a catfish poboy and some onion straws!  they were yum!  definitely the best catfish ive had in vegas so far.  plus i like being around louisiana folks!  lol!
went for lunch super yummy the po boy was yummy and the dirty cajun fries were bomb a little small but super cute inside
in town on vacation and tried this place for the first time. im from mobile, alabama, so im familiar with authentic gulf coast seafood cooking. this is true gulf coast seafood cooking.i picked the fried shrimp po boy. it was greatly dressed with just the right amount of messiness. the bread was the perfect type of bread that you want for a po boy. it was the perfect blend of hard and soft.the shrimp were fried perfectly. however, id prefer a little lighter hand on the spice. it definitely opened my nostrils.also, had i known that the onion rings were actually onion strings, then i would have picked french fries or potato chips. the menu reads onion rings. this should be changed to make it clear to the customer.however, this place has great food and service. thumbs up!!!
i had the chicken and sausage gumbo, and it was very flavorful ..with the cajun fries. ..
stopped in just because we were walking by. enjoyed the atmosphere very clean, cute decor.  zydeco special po boy, cajun fries, and a small gumbo between 2 people and we were stuffed with some left over.  gumbo was great only suggestion is it could stand to be a little thicker. po boy was great,  flavor was on point.
yaaaaaaaaasss! got my gumbo fix! the service was southern, warm, and i felt like i was back in nawlins. owner will make sure you love your food. will definitely be back. prob once a week.
nicely spiced catfish poboy with hearty red beans and rice and gumbo. paired with an abita beer, we had a great lunch at this unpretentious spot downtown.  staff was pleasant and helpful.  well be back!
if you are looking for a hip wine bar you have found it. master sommelier always a sure bet!  food was great, but go for the wine.
went here a few days ago. absolutely amazing food. i had the burger and it was incredible, and my wife had the roasted chicken which she also said was amazing. only and major downside. it was incredibly loud to the point of not being able to have a conversation. we will go back!
all in all, this place is pretty great.  the only small complaint would be about the service.  we arrived for our 5:30 reservation but decided to sit at the bar instead.  the entire place was pretty empty.  the bartender came over after about 10 minutes which was fine since we were perusing the wine list and food menu.  we ordered two glasses of wine and said we needed a minute on the food menu.  well, he didnt come back for 30 minutes and proceeded to clean the front windows even though there were many staff members just hanging out because it was so early while we were waiting to order.  i cant imagine thats a high priority for a bartender on a saturday night.  we actually finally got the other bartender to wait on us and he was pretty awesome the rest of the night.anyway, that being said, the food was amazing.  we started with cheese and meat, then the citrus cured salmon, pork belly, clam spaghetti and the ice cream sandwich for dessert.  everything was really delicious.   all of the flavors were simple and fresh and worked very well together.  we will be back soon and often.
loved this place. great atmosphere with a wide variety of wine selections. the food was outstanding. we ordered the chicken liver mousse, octopus and split the burger. i cant even pick a favorite out of those 3 because they were all amazing.  one word of caution  we allowed the bartender to choose a wine for us to try after saying that i liked tempranillo and it turned out to be 20glass. not a huge deal for some people...but i also made a point to ask how much it was and that question went unanswered.  other than that it was amazing and ill definitely be back to try other menu items!
excellent service with very knowledgeable bar staff. nice outdoor seating area but the ambiance inside is where its at.  great place to bring a group.  you can hear each other talk and not be on top of the tables next to you.reasonable prices for a wine bar.
today was chef pandas first day serving up tasty, high quality chinese food to surprise, az.  i sampled the kung pao chicken, using this dish as a benchmark for all oriental restaurants and found it to be excellent. there were a few opening day hiccups, but nothing major. i enjoyed the food, the staff was helpful and welcoming and i hope youll give the restaurant a try for dining in, take away, or delivery.
after reading the yelp reviews we decided to give chef panda a try.  with a lack of good chinese food places here in surprise that my hubby approves of i was hesitant to try something new again.  we ordered the orange chicken, sesame chicken, general tsos chicken and vegetable lo mein.  also had a few egg rolls and some fried rice.  we ordered takeout and the staff was very friendly and my order was ready right on time.  the food was still piping hot when we got home.  i felt the portion sizes were fairly generous for the price.  we all enjoyed our food, however, neither my hubby or i cared for the sauce on the general tsos chicken.  it wasnt bad it just wasnt as good as some that we have had.  the only criticism i have is that when i ordered a side of fried rice to go with one of my entrees it was literally only rice.  no peas, corn or egg like usual.  the rice had great flavor it was just rather plain.  we were very pleased with our first experience and will definately dine with chef panda again.
as a lover of chinese food, i had to try this new restaurant. its also very close to home. service was great. owner talked with us about some decorating they would be doing and what we thought. he wants to be involved with the community, which surprise needs. i ordered pork fried rice and egg foo young to go. both were good. i do prefer more gravy with the egg foo young and im sure they would accommodate if asked. the prices are good too. next time i want to try their lunch specials and taste their variety of entrees.
surprised no one has reviewed this place. its in an amazing area and watching the market getting ready to open definitely added to the experience. this is for their omelette which tasted amazing and looked so pretty that i almost didnt want to eat it. it certainly wasnt the omelette im used to having, it was actually more like a frittata in texture than say an american omellete that tends to be thinner and not as fluffy. it was nice they didnt overfill it with too much ham and cheese, because the highlight was the omellete and the quality of the eggs that i hope they got them from the market.
un petitdejeuner du samedi matin quasi parfait! une petite salade de roquette fraiche a souhait, des fruits dignes du marche jeantalon, du vrai bacon pas trop cuit qui ne baigne pas dans le gras et deux œufs frais tournes cuits a la perfection!seul petit hic: les pommes de terre industrielles sans saveur et sans assaisonnement ainsi quun pain industriel egalement. avec les belles boulangeries quil y a au marche, leffort est plutot minime pour offrir une belle tranche de pain miche surtout que la boulangerie au pain dore est juste a cote!.
very decent cafe facing onto the marche jean talon, in my opinion the premier farmers market in montreal. we come here for breakfast. coffee is excellent, nice menu with enough variation to be interesting without falling into the multipages trap.i had a basic canadian breakfast  eggs, proper bacon, beans much better than expected, lots of fruit and roasted potatoes, and a light sausage paste that is smeared on toast. less than 10 canadian.
good ol tennessee cookin. guys are super nice! i got the blt minus the b, with egg and fried green tomatoes. took me back to frankiln tn and my taste buds were loving it. everyone in our group was super happy with what they got. ill be finding them again soon :
came here for the tasting private event tonight. they served me potstickers which was just about as good as any other potstickers ive had. crab dungeoness filled with curry, which was really different. then the beef stew noodle  lack of flavor but i added soy sauce so it made it better.  then the bbq pork fried rice which was pretty good. then the stir fry beef was good as well, the beef was tender.  then the pad thai, which can be more flavorful but for a chinese place, was kind of an off dish. the tasting was very fulfilling, medium sized portions. seating, im not sure how much i liked the high chairs, difficult to scoot into the table.
did not intend to dine here but our favorite mexican restaurant was closed :. so glad we ended up here!enjoyed their pad thai dish.. sooo yummy! good sized portion not too big, and but just enough. loved the ambiance, cleanliness, quick service, and the server was nice and friendly. will definitely come back.
panda express meets pf chang.. located inside silverton casinoopen july 3,2015.you go to the register and order what you want, they give you a  and then find yourself a table the table here are very high, im a shorty and ive a hard time getting up..hehe and theyll bring the food to you..made to order..ive been here a few times and i really like the chinese food here. affordable price and good amount of food.small and contemporary decor..their starter are not worth ordering bc its over price so little food.. my fav. by far are their tom yum chicken, beef stew noodle and pork belly bun.
i was pleasantly surprised by this new dining experience at silverton.  we ordered honey walnut shrimp and lettuce cups for or appetziers.  shrimp were extra large. perfectly cooked and tasted amazing.  the lettuce cups were presented perfectly with chicken, mushrooms, pine nuts, etc.  for our main dishes we had beef chow fun and mongolian beef.  both were very flavorful.  only reason why i didnt give it 5 stars was that some of the beef was a little tough and chewy, but all in all, i will definitely be back.
good egg rolls, a meal unto themselves. great, fresh food. asian food done right. leaves you dreaming of more...
finally tried wuhu noodle at silverton....loved it!  i will certainly be back to try more of their extensive menu offerings!  pork belly steamed buns were different than what i was expecting  more like bahn mi  so delish!!  the pork belly was perfectly cooked  crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside  3 to a serving for 10  listed as an appetizer but certainly enough for a meal if you dont want to share.  pad thai was perfectly balanced with thin noodles and a wonderful sweet spicy sauce  again a fairly large portion.  i took away one star for their seating  all highboy tables and there are too many squeezed into the space  so it makes it a bit claustrophobic and inconvenient for the shortelderlymovement impaired.  there is only one utensil station tucked into a corner  i might suggest a second station, perhaps by the drink station.  service was quick and unobtrusive.  i will be back!!!
no veggie options. the chef will make a veggie pad thai, if you ask.coupons for half off are available in the local chinese newspaper.the half off coupon the casino offers will not work here.
very clean restaurant,  i was impressed! customer service was good.  i thought the portion size was going to be small but my eyes were bigger than my stomach!  lol
i had the pleasure of attending the yee here recently.  i enjoyed the food and made plans then to come back.  i brought the wife along as like me she lives asian cuisine.    we started out with the siu mai and szechuan dumplings.  the siu mai were tasty and seemed much larger than other places.  the dumplings were perfect and not too spicy.  for the main course we had the pad thai, mongolian beef and wuhu beef fried rice.  the pad thai was the least favorite thing we ordered.  the noodles were stuck together and it had a sour taste.  the beef fried rice was very good.  lots of great tasting beef paired with the tasty fried rice.  the mongolian beef was well prepared with tensor beef and veggies.  the sauce was a great compliment to the delicious dish.     we had some leftovers and added a few item for our daughter.   got her the tonkotsu ramen, walnut shrimp and pot stickers.  she loved the walnut shrimp and pit stickers.  the ramen was very good also as i gave it a try.  she didnt share the shrimp or pot stickers!     being in a casino is kind of a problem for me as i dont care for the smoke walk to get to a restaurant.  the good thing is the silverton is not that bad compared to many casinos.  the prices at wuhu are very good and what you get will please your asian food cravings.  they have a variety of food from all over asia.  it is well prepared with fresh ingredients.  this is not a high end place but you get good food and it comes to your table pretty fast.  if i am in the area i will definitely come back.
having been impressed with management and the chef at the newbie event, i returned to the fast casual restaurant in the silverton to have some dishes again and to try some new ones. we werent disappointed and we were satisfied with everything. there was no wait to be seated with plenty of high top tables available when we arrived on a saturday night.after ordering at the counter and pouring our drinks at the fountain, our food was delivered to our table after a short 5 minute wait. the employees were helpful at the counter and at food delivery. our order included wuhu noodle soup with beef, hk wonton noodle soup, pot stickers, siu mai, pork belly steamed buns, wuhu fried rice with chicken, and broccoli and beef.originally, my wife wanted the beef noodle soup, but we did a swap and she took the wonton soup once she tasted handmade shrimp and pork wontons. the broth was also delicious with mushrooms, scallions, and other greens. my favorite for the night were the pork belly steamed buns. the soft, sweet bao, salty pork belly, and acidic pickled daikon, carrots, and micro greens together was a great couple of bites.one of their signature dishes is the roasted duck which they keep on display inside the roaster and is something ill keep in mind to order on a future visit. the menu at wuhu is varied covering a nice chunk of the asian spectrum of food with prices that are reasonable. and although i wasnt woohooing across the casino, wuhu is a solid option if your fixing for some noodles and other asian dishes.
good food for a casino restaurant in the food court.  kids menu prices were a little steep, but the food was prepared well and fresh on the spot.  the broccoli and beef was a little bland.
this was my first time coming to this place and i will have to say that the carne asada is my new favorite. it is a bit greasy but has amazing grilled flavor and is nice and tender. i tried one regular carne asade taco, a asada burro, and a pork tamale. my wife had two carne asada grande tacos and a beef tamale. this was also my first time ever eating a tamale and it was a bit sweet for both my wife and i and she grew up eating tamales so i would have to trust her judgment on that! the burro was crammed full of meat which is something i have almost never seen at other places, because its usually just filler with a few pieces of meat, so that was amazing! we also ordered a regular size horchata  for my wife and a large fountain drink for me. all of this ended up being just under 20 for the two of us so this place is really reasonable. the decor is pretty basic which i dont care about but if you care about ambiance, just focus on the delicious food instead. chips and salsa were complimentary which was nice. the green tomatillo sauces were pretty standard and didnt really have much flavor and the other red salsas were pretty spicy so keep that in mind if youre sensitive to heat, but i enjoyed them nonetheless! 1 star because the restrooms needed some attention with the floors and empty soap dipensers, while the place does have a sign in the main plaza sign list it really needs a better one above the front door instead of the vinyl banner that blew up and over the roof, and finally refills for drinks are a dollar per refill! this was a big turn off for me since if you do some research the average cost of a 20oz fountain drink is about 0.220.25 if you add up the cost of the syrup, water, ice, cup, lid, and straw. so with a large drink costing 2.50 here, i could get eight refills using new cups, lids, straws, etc., and they would still make a profit! id say either make the refill cost much less or get smaller cups, charge a bit less for them, and then have free refills. that is really the only thing that truly bothered me about this place.overall, this place was great for our first time visit! the food tasted fresh and cooked to order and the cashier was friendly. well be going back!
we live near this establishment. great al pastor tacos. with lots of room for a large family to eat.tues and wednesday are 99cent tacos al pastor and chicken....
if youre looking for a hangout place with delicious and reasonably priced food, friendly staff, and free kareoke, cardings is the spot! thank you for a great night. wish we couldve stayed longer, but we will come back here if were in vegas again.
legit place to go and get your smoke on. they have plenty of good stuff on sale and for decent prices. its a smoke shop so the employees are pretty chill.
i came here for brunch this morning their first brunch service and was shocked at how great everything was! how i didnt notice this place going up is beyond me as i drive by many times a week, but i didnt. this place is huge, like a compound almost. they have a huge yardpatio, the restaurant with a bar, a separate bar, and a separate coffee bar. the buildings were mostly made of old shipping containers, which was super neat. i went with a meetup group and the restaurant was very accommodating for our very large party. for food, i had the brioche with red eye gravy and bacon and also got to try the cast iron pancake and the breakfast chimichanga. out of all i tried, i felt like my brioche was the best item. the  bread itself was sweet and played well with the savory gravy, crispy bacon, perfectly sauteed greens, and runny egg. the pancake was giant and tasty, topped with fruit compote. the chimi was also a large portion, that looked perfectly crispy. unfortunately, i think they preroll these things because they cant change the contents of the burrito, but the flavor was decent. this was probably my least favorite of the three. needless to say, i will definitely return to this restaurant for brunch, booze, and other meals!
this place is new and so far the menu has a lot of delicious options. it was hard to choose because the flavor combos were all so intriguing. lots of wine selections and classy cocktails
i loved this concept. the program of the spaces is separated around a central courtyard so it feels open and breezy. i was there for sunday brunch and the food was excellent, really, on point. everything that was brought to the table was excellent. i give four stars because our server was frazzled and slightly unorganized, and because they were missing a few menu items which was was disappointing. i will definitely be going back to see if i can try the black truffle quiche.
the atmosphere is relaxing and open.  the staff, very friendly and the food and drinks top it all off for an excellent experience. 4.5 stars all the way!
need to come back to give it five stars!  great service with attentive staff.  sat outside with a few flies but not bad.  inside looked great and outside was perfect for having grandkids with us.  all of our dishes were well received: hash, breakfast chimi, hamburger and baked cauliflower.  i dont like cauliflower much but this was delicious.  baked with lemon and still crisp its a must try.  burger was good, fries better.  pancakes werent bad.  toasted brioche was good but could use a second egg. prices were acceptable with a bottomless mimosa for 18 bucks. well be back.
fantastic brunch! they just opened their doors and this place is packed to the gills! very hospitable, comfortable, and most of all killer menufood.smoked beets with ricotta  pistachio phenomenal chimichanga fantasticbacon meh. not worth ordering, flimsy  didnt  seem to be thicker than oscar meyer.skillet pancake special pretty amazing! just go! i. abt waiters eat through this fantastic menu.
huge, gorgeous location with knockyoursocksoff  food, poor acoustics its super loud! and service thats pleasant but might be a tad slow.the fare is foodiegrade blissful. the ingredients are amazingly fresh and the preparation and presentation are phenomenal. really: excellent food!! there were 6 people in our party, and every single dish looked gorgeous and produced satisfied sighs.the place is more complex than restaurant: huge, modern, and gorgeous. the only downside is you cant hear yourself think inside the main restaurant.  there are tons of outdoor seating options and a huge grassy area for tiny tots to play. this place has been open only a few weeks and its already packed! make reservations but be prepared to wait a few minutes even then. the staff are working super hard to work out the kinks, so theyre super friendly but your order might take a while. ill be sure to visit in a few weeks to update this  until then, just keep in mind that the convenience factor is low.
short story very good food in a comfortable attractive atmosphere served by untrained servers. based on one visit. at least my server was very inexperienced serving tables and knew nothing about the food.more detailed longer storyi arrived five minutes before the restaurant opened and the parking lot only had two parking spots open. as i strolled to the restaurant i noticed a small coffee building and lots of attractive outdoor seating with an outside bar. i also noticed the restaurant wasnt full of guest yet so i wondered why the lot was full.the restaurant is sleek, modern, light and airy with comfortable seating. the menu is modern with international accents. they feature hot and cold not  so  small, small plates and larger plates that feature many chicken dishes. the plates are meant to be shared so a couple might want to share up to three plates. the wine menu is written for wine dummies and has symbols so a ten year old can understand each bottle of wine.the restaurant wasnt full yet but the hostess sat us at a table that they were using as a bus stand filled with many used wine glasses. she pulled the table apart so goodygoody we could sit on the clean end. the pulled table left very little room between tables.we informed out server that we were sharing the plates we ordered but she didnt space them them out and served all three plates at once barely fitting them on the small deuce of a table. we told her to bring one plate back so wed have a little room.we started with the spinach salad. the detailed fresh salad sat on top of silky buttery smoked salmon. it was a very perfect balanced salad and was very good. next was the japanese fish and chips. i asked what kind of fish was used. a trained server would know what kind of fish was used. a good server would say something like, i dont know but ill find out. our server said,  i think..japanese fish. i was eventually told after asking three more times that the fish used was cod or at least that was what i was told. it was mild sweet moist and meaty and prepared to perfection. the fish was so good i would not have recognized it as cod. the fries might have been the weakest of what i tried as they were tasty but sort of dry and not crispy. they also didnt come with a dipping sauce so they were easy to push aside.the thai style roasted chicken was developed with flavor and was very juicy and moist. perhaps from sitting the skin was soggy and not edible to me but the sauce over it was absolutely delicious. based on this one visit its a good bet that any chicken dish will be delicious but might have soggy skin.when we finished the plate instead of our server saying something like we have many delicious desserts or something like can i get you anything else?........the server said, do you want anything else?i do note this is a newly opened restaurant that serves up delicious food. service based on my visit isnt on the same level as the food.some growing pains but a wonderful menu with very good food in an attractive atmosphere.slight update 112815service has improved and the food is still delicious! this is a wonderful restaurant!4.5 stars
great tasting food, white wine and beer.  loved the curry coconut soup and vegetables, and he enjoyed his fries that were not watered down like other eatery places are. best fries ever and their sandwiches too. the waiters were friendly and we had no problems. we sat inside and what we liked was the fact that their music wasnt super loud like other places are. the outdoor area is beautiful and welcoming. looking forward to coming back.
beautiful, relaxed setting. the menu is artful and sophisticated, with a wide variety of dishes, and reasonably priced! every dish is beautifully presented too. we had the grapefruit brulee a while fruit, not just half, perfect to share, hash, cauliflower and raw farm veggies. more than enough food and all fresh, delicious and interesting. we cant wait to get back and try more of the menu. good service today as well!
i almost died from coolness when i walked into this place. the indoor space is hip, but the outside....! a space near the bar, a grassy area, a traditional patio....all with a very modern farmhouse feel. our group included lots of babies and little kids, and the space was perfect for keeping them entertained.the service was very friendly and a very slight delay was totally excusable since they had only been open 2 weeks, and we came in a group of 12.the beer and cocktail list is pretty cool. they have a wide selection for decent prices, and include a bottomless mimosa option 15? 20? i cant remember..... we also shared a big bottle of beer...a saison that was pretty good, wish i could remember the name.the brunch food overall was good, not great. pancakes and breakfast chimi were just ok. the bread pudding and burger were pretty good. where ocotillo really shined was their veggies. loved both the zucchini and the cauliflower.cant wait to sit outside when the weather gets a little cooler at happy hour.note to ocotillo management: are you planning to add some mistersfans in the outside space??? it could use it! also, there seemed to be a lot of flies out the morning we were there. i dont know if theres anything you can do about that....
i really enjoyed this place. there are many different areas of this place both inside and out...the main restaurant is bright and sleek and the patio is lovely. there is also a grassy area and an area with comfy couches to relax and enjoy the gorgeous fall weather.i had the chicken dumplings off the small plates menu. they had just enough kick to them to make them interesting. my coworker had the tofu sandwich with fries. we both had the desert which was a layered mousse with samoa girl scout cookies...delicious! i will definitely be back to sample more items from their menu.
great new addition to the neighborhood!  i absolutely love the space and cant wait for this place to extend their hours.  i was surprised that the outdoor space was used a little better to accommodate additional outdoor seating, but maybe that is a work in progress.  the service was friendly and the food came out quite quick.  i thoroughly enjoyed my tandoori chicken sandwich with fries  so tasty!
super excited by this restaurant, even better that its literally a 2 minute walk for me.food was great, breakfast burrito was good and flavorful.  the environment is spot on, but they could use some outdoor tvs, which would make it a great spot to watch sunday football.  looking forward to many visits in the future to try all they have to offer.one downside, and i totally agree with other reviews, is their drinks.  even the orange juice was watered down, tasted more like a powdered orange drink rather than freshly squeezed.also was shocked to order a simple patron margarita on the rocks and then to receive a 23 bill for it.  wtf?!?!?  do they think they are in manhattan instead of phoenix?
first time stopping in and enjoyed every bit of it. has a weird but funky and cool set up to the place. real open courtyard type area for places to sit inside and outside. was greeted with a smile and was helped right away. all staff seemed to be very friendly and willing to help and give opinions on food. i had the oaxaca chicken plate with brown rice and black beans. it was very tasty and served at a fast pace. perfect for a lunch spot while during a work day. also got a chance to try my fiances japanese fish and chips which was also very tasty. i would definitely come back for more and have the same dish although very eager to try other menu items. while there dont forget to order the tea if you are a passion fruit type person.
good service, not great service. but excellent food. we will be back.
fab food , service could be better , i presume working out the kinks , ill be back .
what a great concept! the food was great. my buddys food was good too, but just warm not hot. i cant wait to try the dinner menu. this is the new go to place for small and large parties.
great place! love the atmosphere and the staff is always friendly! the food is also amaze balls! breakfast chimichanga for life!
fab new spot located in central phoenix. it does a great job of delivering delicious new american food and providing an open and industrialmodern space. the spot contains a restaurant, cafe and tons of open space like a beer garden, bar and patio.for the restaurant menu wise, they serve lunch and dinner. however, they only serve brunch on the weekends. i came here for lunch with stacy m to get a little taste of what ocotillo had to offer and was pleasantly surprised. we ordered their iced coffee boba, filled dates, cabbage salad and a egg white breakfast burrito to share and it was more than enough.iced coffee boba: i would pass on this as the coffee tastes like any typical iced coffee you can get, however the boba was overly done and mushy instead of having the chewy, bouncy texture it should have.dates: dates filled with ricotta and topped with almonds and blackberries, this appetizer is deliciously simple and perfect for sharing. no judgement if you dont want to, its perfectly acceptable because they are that good!cabbage salad: this salad is fresh, light and comes is a more than generous portion. it has shaved cabbage, carrot and comes with a lovely tea dressing that adds a tart and fragrant flavor to the salad.the egg white burrito: was probably the best egg white anything ive ever had, it was so flavorful and clean. this entree surprised me the most. filling, clean tasting but nothing short of flavorful from the ingredients and house salsa thats served with it.the cafe is the only cafe in phoenix that serves sightglass coffee and has a good arrangement of drinks, snacks and pastries. although separate from the rest of the restaurant, this area is quiet and perfect for solo coffeetea drinkers. ive had their autumn latte, breakfast burrito egg and bacon as well as their nutella croissant and it was all so delicious. they definitely take typically made items and add their own twist which is truly refreshing. the price is also a lot cheaper than most other cafes i frequent, which is a definite plus!the staff here can be a bit slow, but they are all so friendly and easy to talk to. they truly make you feel welcomed and show their appreciation. they are also really receptive to any questions or concerns you may have. definitely a place to check out!
tasty food and the ambience of this restaurant is great! i enjoyed my cauliflower veggie dish and the falafel sandwich was fantastic! the service was a bit slow, which i figured since its a fairly new place. i enjoyed watching the chefs cooking in the kitchen and everything looked clean and in order. surprisingly its a large space and they have a separate area for the coffee shop, which i didnt get a chance to try but will definitely return to sample their coffee.
everything was delicious!!! one thing, we didnt get a hello at the door nor was the hostess welcoming when we first arrived. it took 5min before someone put our name on the list when there was no one in the lobby. they need to improve customer service, but other than that, everything was awesome!
right to the point here: my coffee was excellent. and you can tell they know what they are doing and are good at it, so i will definitely be back for more. my only complaint is that the atmosphere feels rather cold and sterile,and the vibe i got from some of the employees was less than friendly. it seems like the space itself was designed for an upscale area in chicago or new york rather than a college neighborhood in madison. that being said, i will try and stop by when its a little busier and bring some people with me to see if maybe the weird vibe i got was all in my head. all that really matters is the coffee, though, and im excited to try some espresso drinks and experience the magic that others have been raving about!
stopped in here after hearing all the rave reviews on this place. the space inside is very nicely decorated. very spacious. most of the stuff on the menu only comes in one size option. i got a cappuccino and a plain croissant. the coffee was excellent. very smooth. nice drinking temperature right off the bat, so it didnt sear my taste buds off. the croissant was huge! very fluffy on the inside with a nice crust outside. the coffee takes a minute to make, so might not be the best option if youre in a rush. but its definitely worth the wait. also, this is the only place ive ever seen that shows coffee brewing competitions? on their tv! pretty awesome.
two visits...two superb coffee drinks. todays latte was creamy with excellent espresso as a base. the double espresso, while too expensive 3.75?, was marvelous  as well. batch bakery treats and nice outdoor seating make for a nice place to stop for a break.
oh yea, i am a fan! ive been in madison for more than 2 years, and this is my first time here.  i used to live in downtown, but now im visiting in the hilldale area. wanted to go to a cafe but couldnt decide where i wanted to go, so i decided to try something new and ended up here! super chill vibes and nice baristacashier! they have a tiny menu just the basics, but im sure there are many ways you can complicate your order with how you want your coffee brewed. i just ordered a latte and it is rich and delicious! they also carry pastries from batch bakery! yum!! plus points for them! : they have several large tables that seat 6 each, a couple with 4 seats, and then some seating outside. large space, so it feels cozy and these large tables remind me of the starbucks i went to all the time in grad school so its giving me warm vibes. it has a bit of an industrial kind of feel to the inside decor.. but not overly done. feels humble but not uncomfortable.
5th element stands out in the madison specialty coffee scene. why? because its about the only contender. does it add a new element or a new dimension to coffee? no, not any more than any other specialty coffee shop. they have a few special things going for them though. alejandro mendez, winner of the 2011 world barista championship, which is obviously an impressive title. hes coowner or something. and apparently he brought the the wbc official machine back with him. black eagle by victoria arduino. the only one in wisconsin and the first one ive ever seen. they have their own inhouse roasted coffee along with a few guest roasters. i tried an award winning coffee of theirs in aeropress. was it good? ehhh, quite too dark for my preferences. design: is it cool? yes, its fresh and clean if maybe a bit harsh. but can i say harsh in a good way? yes, i just did. so harsh design and mediocre coffee? nah, it was great. overall i was reasonably impressed and i was glad i stopped.
this location just opened and had to grab a burrito before going to the movies. it was great as always. theyre forgiven since its a new location, but they really need to learn quick how to speed it up. i waited 20 minutes. no pork carnitas right now because of an issue with their supplier. but 7 for a giant chicken burrito? ill definitely be back!
so glad they finally got this chipotle up and running.  qdoba was okay, but you cant be chipotle.  staff is excellent and the sofritas are excellent.  staff is amazing, and theyd ont skimp you on the toppings.  thank you!
you cant beat online ordering and i used the app to customize the very picky orders of my wife and kids. you can select many ingredients and put in notes. all seemed to be followed to a t. plus you skip the line when you come to pickup. dont get greedy on a parking spot. anywhere in the 28226 on a friday or saturday night is a close spot. wear sneakers. its chipotle. food quality is good and guac is extra.
ive been here twice now, once when it first opened and once again during lunch this past week. i think they have gotten into their groove, and like most chipotles deliver a good product. we were lucky enough to go on a nice day, and with plenty of outdoor seating enjoyed our bowls in the nice sunshine. i ordered the steak bowl and really the only thing i can fault is that the steak was a bit chewy. i definitely do not think it was the cook but the quality of steak that was used. i would stick in the future with the chicken, but was craving red meat at the time. the employees were nice enough, and knew what they were doing. also this location sends out coupons to the surrounding area, so we were able to get a bogo bowl, awesome.
im surprised the reviews arent better. service was fast and excellent. they were all friendly. restaurant was clean. seating is better than other chipotle restaurants. only flaw we had when we went was that they didnt have the veggies.
so few restaurants in charlotte are truly unique, so we were so pleasantly surprised when this was really different. service taylor! was excellent, flavor was good, and prices were well worth it. get the poutin! so happy to have this in fort mill!
very innovative chef! great ideas.  masterful creations of small plates.  they change the menu often which is good and bad..  good because of variety, but bad because if i really like something, i want it again.  they could have a few more wine selections on the mediumupper end  overall, i had a great experience. ive been there twice.  great location too.
small plates creates an atmosphere of a fun tasting menu that everyone can share. the food is fresh and vibrant!  try everything and then orders seconds on your favorite!
excellent service and phenomenal food! dont pass this place up  its a real gem.
i have seen a lot of food business come and go in this building but this place seems like a winner.the staff were very friendly and being a first timer there explained the way it works. i had the breakfast plate of eggs bacon and potatoes. it came will fruit or beans.. went with the fruit.. little weird it came out on a plastic plate with plastic fork but didnt take away from the good taste of the food. the price is what i think is spot on for what your getting.i do plan to return to try some other things on the menu.dont forget to support local businesses
beau et bon petit cafe de quartier! ils vendent meme du pain italien succulent! ils prennent seulement largent comptant, mais ce nest quun detail
haggen reorganized the produce section and in my opinion it flows so much better, there seems to be a greater selection of produce now too.  not to mention a larger organic section to choose from as well.  the spacing of aisles is much better.  as far as selection of products, they do have a quite a bit that im still trying to get accustomed to.  its too early to tell if im a fan of their brands stuff or stick with my favorite product brands.  as for selection of meats and seafood, it seems about the same if not a little bit more.  the one area that seems to be a bit bare at the time i went is the bakery section.  its definitely a lot more roomy in that section, but seems like it could use an extra self standing self or two in the common space.  as far as selection of breads and stuff, a good amount but one thing missing was some pita bread.  the lady said they will look into it as the old vons used to have it and it seems odd to have all these different hummus, yogurt dips, etc. with no fresh pita bread.as far as the staff, it seems to be a lot of the same friendly vons staff from before.  checking out is still pretty smooth and plenty of open stands.  the staff mentioned there will be a few more upgrades in the coming months, given what ive seen so far itll be exciting to see what else they add to bring this regional chain into town!
was at haggen today and immediately noticed a beautiful and meticulously arranged produce department. they had stacked leaf lettuce in a box, which is perfect for making sandwiches. its extremely hard to find. every employee i spoke to was polite and helpful. the bakery was just as nice as when vons had it and i saw some new brands i never saw before. ive never seen so many kinds of butter and margarine. i think people may be used to things as they were, but i think over time, this will be a great store. i dont mind paying a few pennies more to shop in such a clean, open and friendly store. it was also nice not to hear mariah carey and kenny g music pumped into the place for a change. i liked it.
good atmosphere clean limited menu but the food is good not great but good. plenty of beer choices. chances of returning fair.
id highly recommend mr. brews for happy hour! running from 36pm on mondayfriday, their generous timeframe coupled with the 3.50pint deal makes you feel like youve hit the jackpot! as far as selection of brews go, there are plenty to choose on the multipage drink menu! however their drink menu does not provide location information citystatecountry for the brewing companies which i enjoy using as part of the decisionmaking process. as of late august, they were featuring fulton brewing company beers, and the randonneur is a top pick for those who like summer seasonals and saisons.the cheese curds at mr. brews were very standard. with more breading than cheese, i was not impressed but satisfied because hey, they are still cheese curds!overall the feel was industrial with a small pocket of nice coucheschairs if you wish to partake. several wallmounted televisions will likely make mr. brews a great place to a catch a game come football season.
i came with friends to this bar because we wanted to watch a football game. there was another bar we wanted to go to but it was toooooo busy for us and we couldnt get a table. drinks  my friend got a here gose the grapefruit and i ordered the raspberry kombucha. they were both delicious and only 5 each. really reasonable.atmosphere  lots of hightops and tvs which was greatly appreciated, but the sound only worked for one of the tvs at the bar that was not playing our game which was disappointing. food  we also ordered a family size fresh cut fries. my friend wanted to try out two different seasonings: cajun and parmesan garlic. they were able to give us a basket of each and we also requested a side of the beer cheese sauce. i am definitely coming back again. parking was not that bad. i got a spot right outside of the bar.
this place was a little strange to me but i liked it. they have a huge beer selection! even for wisconsin standards it was pretty big. the staff was extremely friendly! we were all shocked at how small the place was for such a huge beer selection. i guess i just expected a larger dining area. it was fine though. the food menu is very small! its basically burgers and fries. if you arent in the mood for that i would skip this place. we all enjoyed our burgers though! i cant say enough about how sweet the staff was! if im ever in the area again ill definitely at least stop in for a few beers!
less crowded than hopcat but still with a great beer selection.  the staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  i really like the homemade chips.  you can choose plain or with a seasoning of your choice.  a solid edition to the downtown bar scene.
dana is a true professional! she gave me the color i have been wanting, without having to bleach my hair. ive seen her work cut, color, and styling, and she is amazing!!! this was my first time with her and definitely not my last! i went from a brownhair girl, to a fadedred hair girl...to a now hot redheaded woman, lol! thank dana!
i love this store!  only giving 4 stars cause i cant use my vons club card anymore. but hey pick your own six pack!
well not sure how to rate this place the food is good but a lot of work for what your paying they dont give you any thing to open the crap with or even to take the intestinal tract out of the shrimp heads and tails just yummy but the other not so much ill try it again but ill be armed with all i need to destroy my crab
everything i order was great except the gator nuggets, they were pretty nasty compared to other places i have had fried gator. i will be going back just wont order any fried gator!
everything i order was great except the gator nuggets, they were pretty nasty compared to other places i have had fried gator. i will be going back just wont order any fried gator! went back today 111315 and had the catfish basket and i have to say it was great. the staff is hella dope great atmosphere.
great place and ill be back. ok, on that note.... i went there with several friends on a tuesday important notation, youll see why later. there were 12 of us so they gave us the back room so we would be trapped with each other, oh, i mean, have time to socialize with each other. i was impressed that jason, the manager took the time to stop by when we got there and welcomed us. although maybe he only did that because the back room was on the way to his office? he was very friendly and helpful explaining how things worked there as only 2 of our group had been there before. our waiter was also very friendly and attentive and patient with some in our group who like a lot of attention from wait staff more commonly known as pain in the aes. i ordered the monday special, mixed bag 2 lbs bag with a mixture of shrimp, snow crab legs, mussels, and veggies for only 20. another thanks to jason who said they had a couple of bags left over from the day before now you know why tuesday was important earlier. it was awesome. cooked in a plastic bag to perfection. they let you rip the bag open on the table paper tablecloth and eat from the bag with your hands. personally i would have preferred to have been offered a plate and, at least, a fork i did finally ask for a fork, and got a cheap plastic one. the sauce was leaking out of the bag and i had to build a napkin dam to stop it from dripping onto my lap. also, a good thing i didnt succumb to peer pressure and not wear my bib, as my shirt would have been a mess. it was worth the teasing to stay clean. luckily for me no one got a picture of me in the bib to post on facebook. anyway, i was pleased with the food and will be back. ok, so why only 4 of 5 stars if it was so good you ask.... next time, at least offer me a plate or bowl preferably to transfer my food to so it doesnt leak all over the place. have some decent silverware on hand for those of us who dont always want to eat with our hands. and, lastly, when you advertise a happy hour, have a happy hour! i understand that they are new and are now only open for dinner at 4:00pm and happy hour is advertised as 36, but would it hurt to offer the happy hour prices from 46 until you open for lunch? just a though, but hey, im not in the restaurant management business.
me and my friend enjoyed lunch here for the first time today  both of us have dined at different cajun shrimp restaurants in the past. together we ordered 1 lb of shrimp in mild trifecta seasoningsauce, 2 sides of rice, cajun fries, and sweet potato fries. the most positive aspect of my whole experience was the excellent customer service. the waiters were very attentive and constantly made sure we were enjoying our meal. the sauce was pretty flavorful and had a nice amount of garlic but it contained more oil than i expected. the oily consistency of the sauce makes eating with your hands a very messy job so dress accordingly and be prepared to use alot of napkins. the sweet potato fries and the cajun fries both had very good portions  definitely enough to split between two people. the fries themselves were thick and a bit more softchewy rather than thin and crunchy. we initially thought that the 1 lb delivered to our table looked a little small, but it was descent. my only complaint would be the amount of rice we were given as a side, it was definitely less than i had hoped for. i would definitely recommend giving this place a try.
been to other locations. .this one just opened up so we stopped in for a drink and a snack...sat at bar was quickly greeted . we ordered a purple haze and a vodka cranberry and gator nuggets.  boyfriend loved the purple haze, there was very little vodka in my drink. the gator nuggets were ok they are deep fried they were a little heavy and i love gator. the bartender checked on us alot which was kidda annoying but it is her job...we like coming here so we will probably be back...but make sure you have money to spend ..it is quite pricey....
i ordered a shrimp po boy and it was pretty good. the decor reminds me of louisiana and  the service is very good here. they are all very attentive. next time i will try the seafood by the pound.
my hubbie and i have been waiting for this restaurant to open and were very happy with our meal.  the chimichanga was perfectly cooked with shredded beef instead of groung beef.  my peach margarita was so delicious and refreshing.  looking forward to going back and trying something new from their menu.
we were hesitant to try this place again after a horrible experience. we came in with low expectations, but were pleasantly surprised. the menu is full and the food was delicious and filling. service started off great, but slowed down a bit. we will definitely return.
food was decent, menu is huge... a little pricey for mexican but i will return. very slow service and the restaurant wasnt packed... our server was more concerned with cleaning and ignoring us than seeing if we needed anything....hopefully shes new to the serving world and not really that neglectful of her patrons.. not fantastic but not horrible either...we will see how the next visit goes :
we stopped by after a day trip down to charleston knowing there was nothing in the house to eat.  i had been wanting to give this place a try, but i had also heard that there had been some difficulties when they first opened, so we went in not knowing what to expect....i was not dissappointed.  i had the texas burrito with grilled shrimp, steak and chicken.  the shrimp were plentiful, and tasty, not overcooked.  the steak and chicken both were well seasoned.  my wife had a veggie chimi, which we had not seen before, and some sangria.  she was very happy with both items.  lastly, my motherinlaw had a grilled chicken quesadilla, which looked great, loaded full of chicken.the service was good, but i can see that if they were super busy the wait staff could get overloaded.  im hoping they are a success.
first time at the restaurant.  service was excellent, food was fresh and flavorful.  portions were good.  prices were very reasonable.  its a mexican sports bar.  perfect for any time.
very authentic pizza! great flavors, thin crust not that cracker crust crap from monicalsjupiters but woodburn soft chewy crust!   we ordered the diavola and margherita pepperoni.   the pepperoni has a bit of a kick to it, so beware if you have kids with sensitive palettes...they wound up picking it off and just having a straight cheese experience.   the diavola was great!  parmesian, arugala i think,  salami i think and mozzerella....so good....no sauce.  we also ordered an italian salad which was ok.... it was well dressed but something was missing....it kind of fell flat.   the employees were super friendly.   they loved our kids.  i love the open kitchen so you could see them making pizza!no plates....just parchment paper rolls on the table.my few gripes about the restaurant which will probably work out over the next few weeks since they just opened.... 1.  it took about 20minutes to get our pizza.   the restaurant wasnt that busy yet... maybe 4 tables ahead of upour order you place your order as soon as you walk in.... kind of like a fast food restaurant vibe but not really.  but considering they have a 1000 degree oven that cooks a pie in 90 seconds, we shouldve had our pizza at our table within 10minutes at most.   2.  the pizza chefs seemed inefficient.... three guys assembling pizzas... one girl putting the finishing touches on them and then she doubles as server too.  a little weird....and still things were sooo slow.   but friendly.3.  the layout of the restaurant is odd.   very spacious.....they could easily fit 10 more tables in.  and by the way the pizza tastes, theyll be packed.   4.  they finish the pizza off by drizzling olive oil on top.... theyre a bit heavy handed with it.... it makes for a very oily pizza.  but thats just personal preference.i love this pizza!   i cant wait to go back.  great pizza is finally coming to champaign!
no line when we got here, but a few people sitting at tables inside. ordering was easy, and we sat down at a half table half booth near the front. they are going for the industrial feel with cement floors and a brick wall. food took 35 minutes to come out. one pizza was enough for 2, but if youre hungry, count on eating your own. i agree with other commentors about the drizzle of oil on top...too much.
delicious in every way. downside was that cheese kept falling off. we will definitely return.
really delicious pizza.  had the diavolo, which was spicy but bright and not overwhelming.  the crust was chewy and firm and delicious with just the right amount of char. the pizzas are not cheap, but the quality is enough to justify the price.  ordered at the front, and had my pizza within 5 minutes.  definitely recommend.
first, let me clarify my rating. it is an average of the food rating and the service rating.the pizza is excellent here. i highly recommend the pepperoni and a limonade san pellegrino. the food comes out quick, is freshly prepared, and tasty.ive had mixed feelings about the customer service before and last night prompted me to write this review. i called in to order take out to be curtly informed that they dont do take out and then hung up on. incredibly rude, but i still wanted pizza.the ordering system is clumsy and there is only one terminal for the employees to put orders into. its a little slow, but probably still faster than traditional waiters. its frustrating to stand in line behind people perusing the menu once youve made up your mind. a second terminal could probably solve this.summary:highs: food  speed, taste, authenticitylows: there has to be a better way to do take out
first off: this is good pizza. the crust is delicious and chewy, and it comes out quickly. if youre looking for jupiters or papa dels style pizza this aint it.  you order everything as soon as you walk in the door which is a bit abrupt but the person at the ordering station was helpful and patient. the cafeteria seating caused a few people to rush in and snag tables before they even ordered, but in the end, everyone had seats. the interior is open and bright maybe too bright?! and the staff, who bring the food and clear the table, are attentive.again, it is cafeteria style, so you do have to get a few things on your own like napkins and water, but i didnt think that was so bad! its a unique dining experience!
a good pizza place is what downtown champaign has needed and pizzeria antica definitely delivers. the crust is obviously the star here. chewy, slightly burnt, great flavor. the food is five stars. ambiance leaves a little to be desired. the open kitchen, exposed brick walls, and simple modern tables are nice, but its far too bright. ordering wasnt bad but if i wanted another beer i wouldve had to wait in quite a long line to get it. in previous reviews this place has gotten a bad rap for pricing, but i dont think its bad. there was no option to tip so that alone saves roughly five to ten dollars depending on your order. this isnt a big chain joint so you cant expect those prices.
i like this pizza! ive told all my friends about this place. nothing fancy but very clean and upbeat! phenominal tasting pizza with the best crust ive ever tasted. very fresh ingredients. my new goto place.  thanks!
this place is a great addition to champaign. real, fresh ingredients on amazing thin crust. i came here with a friend and we started off with a small antica greens salad which came with high quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the side. although simple, it was full of flavor and very good. the small was just enough as a little appetizer before our pizzas arrived.i got the classic margherita pizza and although i probably could have finished it all in one sitting i only had half. it was very thin, light and overall just delicious. my friend got the pomodorini and she said it was also very good. and this is coming from someone who had just spent the summer abroad in italy having the best of the best pizza.
this is a great alternative for pizza in the champaign area. the ingredients are fresh and high quality. the price is a little high but in exchange for nongreasy pizza with nice toppings. the bottom line is that when i want pizza in champaign, i will certainly return to this restaurant.
i had a great experience here. i had the 3d brow strokes and am happy with the results. the brows are very natural and has made my morning routine a lot easier!
very nice establishment with friendly staff members. had no clue what to expect my first time going for the 3d brow service, luckily she was very knowledgable and informative before and after the procedure. i would recommend this place to my closest family and friends. very satisfied customer.
awesome croissant, fantastic soy steam and regular milk stream, pretty good espresso pull. very nice, intimate coffee shop. barista at the time of visit was very friendly.
this little espresso bar on stpierre just off the main tourist strip of stpaul in old montreal is a great spot for a quick coffee when you are looking for quality caffeination but are not in the mood to wait in line for a table at the noisy and always hectic og around the corner.not that everyone will appreciate this but for a giant design nerd like myself, the super modern minimalistic wood interior with 60sinspired collages on the walls and wellcurated design magazine rack was a huge bonus. for real though if you are in the old port and need to kill a half an hour or so and dont want to have to sit next to american tourists with fanny packs, this place is your best bet by far.
very interesting little cafe tucked away in the old port.well worth a visit. the decor is small and intimate: this cafe can only suit maybe 5 people or so. flyjin is more tailored to a coffee onthego, as their service is fast and the coffee is better than other options in the area.very distinct lattes. extremely thick and creamy, quite different than most cafes in montreal who usually treat the frothing differently. definitely worth a try if you are in the area. they also have little muffins and treats, as well as freshsqueezed orange juice.
la petite place est sympathique, bien cachee dans un edifice a bureau. le cafe est bien, le service aussi, quoi quil y ait un peu dattente du au fait qur le barista est seul a faite le cafe et le comptoir. pour une place assise, il faut etre chanceux mais je crois que le concept veut plutot quon prenne pour apporter ou sur place un petit espresso vite fait. ils offrent les patisseries hof kelsten  qui sont tres bonnes, bref agreable petit cafe de quartier bien quil soit situe dans une zone tres touristique.
the barista was super friendly and made great coffee.  they also have a maple syrup latte which was tasty.
amazing bao. went there twice in 4 days and would go back if im ever in montreal again.
the last time we had bao tacos in massachusetts we were disappointed with our experience, but tonight we dined at restaurant bao boys and i have to say that we loved the experience.the service here was great, especially since our french is poor. the restaurant has a great atmosphere and the staff here is incredible. the prices overall were fair and when it came to the quality, we loved the baos.my wife and i split their korean boas and their original baos. the meat in the baos were well seasoned and the baos themselves were of a good consistency and didnt fall apart like some other restaurants we have visited. our meals came with fries which were the best we have had in canada, and the dipping sauce was perfect. the spring rolls we had as appetizers were great as well and it was a shame we only got two. the biggest issue we had here was that when we went to pay up we didnt have enough cash for a great tip, so we will have to go back to provide them the tip that they deserved. also, just a heads up, they deliver, so be prepared to enjoy baos from home instead of paying an arm and a leg for parking in the area.
lovely, airy cafe with a delicious cold brew and homemade scones. the servers were polite and good with questions. my only minor complaint is just that a prominent photograph really clashes with the mood of the space. otherwise, a great spot.
very good coffee spot for downtown working people.the pastries are amazing...make sure to try the crumble.
very good coffee spot for downtown working people. they also have excellent venoiseries.
ive been to the ndg location of melk and loved it but since that neighbourhood is out of my way i was very happy when a second melk opened up downtown.  in this part of montreal starbucks and second cups abound so an alternative is always welcome.  its just south of ste catherine and the space is pretty small but its the same high quality product as their ndg location.they have a small selection of baked goods but they are one of those places that goes for quality over quantity.  my chocolate chip cookie was moist and fresh.  it was as good as any homemade product.  i also enjoyed my iced latte which wasnt bitter at all and was quite refreshing.they dont have wifi which is really the only complaint i have.  i was here to do some work so internet would have been nice.  apart from that though this is a an excellent option for coffee if youre in the downtown core
lovely small space. good soy latte. very friendly staff. cool art on the walls. nicely designed tables.
food: 45service: 45cleanliness: 45price: 3.55i arrived at a good time; there was only one customer in front of me so i was served pretty quickly. after i took a seat, a huge storm of customers came in and lined up all the way to the front door! dont believe me? go see it for yourself   the cafe at its busiest peak can have you waiting longer than your average cafe, but the line moves relatively fast and you will have your drink in no time.the cafe serves 49th parallel coffee just like they do at the original location, so if youre a fan of 49th parallel, youd be glad to know that its here. im not the hugest fan, so i opted for a mochaccino and an apple scone to go along with it. melk is known very much for their scones, and on a busy day, ive heard that they sell out very quickly! indeed, i was the last person who grabbed the apple scone when i visited... there were so many delicious flavours that i really couldnt decide strawberry, peach, apple, cheese, etc. so i let my instincts do the deciding the last one standing duh.anyway, if youre a fan of light roast coffee, youll definitely like the coffee here. my mochaccino was great, but as im not the biggest fan of light roast coffee, it wasnt my favourite. next time, ill order their chai latte. the cafe has a great set of tea options as well if youre a tea drinker like me!my scone was very crispy on the outside but ever so soft on the inside. i really like how there were big chunks of apple inside my scone which added lots of texture and overall flavour to it. the scone was relatively big in size as well, similar to the size you find at starbucks, but more delicious of course! id definitely come back to melk and try a few more of their flavours.i liked how i could help myself to water. it was convenient and it made my stay at melk much better. its little things like this that i really appreciate! overall, the cafe was very well kept  clean, tidy and very photoworthy. a quick search on instagram and youre bombarded with beautiful pictures of latte art from melk mtlcafecrawl.anyhow, if youre the district for whatever reason, you should definitely check it out if you like being on top of your montreal cafes. im not sure if they have wifi, as i didnt see it appear on my laptop. i didnt bother asking as i didnt need it, but itll be great if they have it! even though i dont particularly like 49th parallel coffee, melk bar a cafe is still one of my goto cafes purely for their baked goods and its coffee vibes!nevertheless, its a great place to stop by for a quick caffeine fix, and its definitely a very nice and needed addition in the neighbourhood  starbucks and second cup were pretty much the only options!
amidst the towers of downtown montreal, you will find this great little coffee bar. full of charm, followed by a great espresso! great job on the branding an creating an atmosphere where you want to hang out in downtown montreal.
here we go!been anticipating these wings for a few months... my buddy from buffalo speaks highly of the original spot and this place backed it up! i expected a larger venue but it works. tried hot and lemon pepper both were amazing, got them crispy and i recommend you do the same.fries were good but they needed to be a little crisper! overall good experience think im going back soon. service was great, just wasnt wowed by this place like i thought i would be!
good stuff i had the chicken salad and it was great!
good location at the grand canal shops which imo is the most relaxing mall in vegas. they wings where good, crisp and juicy. the fries i didnt like wish they improved the quality of those. all in all a 3.5
i decided to revisit the anchor bar and give it another chance since last time i was there it was opening week. i thought maybe all that chaos was the reason for the bad food, and i was right. this time my wings were crispy and well sauced, unlike last time. the blue cheese was on point this time as well, and the fries, man the fries are good!! service again was great! maria and the rest of the staff were very awesome! ill definitely will be back after realizing the first time was just a minor hiccup.
i had been to the original anchor bar in buffalo ny so i was excited to check this out. anyway, while the atmosphere cant compare to the originally location, the quality can! the wings tasted almost identical and so did the fries!why not a 5  star? the service was slow during the time i went on labor day. it took over 45 minutes to get my food  who wants to wait that long for food in vegas?
first of all, i love chicken and chicken wings in general. now, i place wings in two categories, either theyre flavorful and moist or crispy and spicy. now there is a small percentage where there is a fair medium and i think i found it. first, the wings are big, almost to that certain the bone is cracked somewhere inside from supporting all this meat size. chicken ive only had from a tyson brand wing, but then theres the flavored sauce that has a tang to it when i tried the hot with bone option, they serve boneless too. the fries feel like an afterthought, not crispy or too soft, they are delicious but i expected some crispy fries and they removed their chipotle option which i thought might have been interesting. i choose the salt and vinegar but tasted nothing on the latter half.the trick on the combo meal is how you eat it. choose from ranch or blue cheese and if you dont mind the celery sticks, just put em on the side to justify your self conscience choice that you at least had a veggie in your presence. now, heres the trick. they hide a pool of awesome sauce for your fries under the wings, because thats where the good stuff is at for the floppy carb potatoe sticks called fries. dip em and soak them up while you enjoy the wad of chicken on each chicken bone. enjoy!food is fast served and delivered to sit down or take on your way like any awesome hangover nursing spot or grub place on the strip. take some time if youre close by and enjoy this spot and the typical bar with original license plate aesthetic that somehow fits that diamond in the rough spot. wing it up and try a beer on tap or three.
chicken wings are one of my secret cravings  ill usually prefer them to other foods theyre associated with aka pizza. a good chicken wing, however, is hard to find as theres not a balance between the chicken and the sauce. its quite a statement to proclaim that an establishment serves the original buffalo chicken wing tm, and the best wings in the world. anchor bar continues the tradition of east coast favorite chains first finding their foot on the west coast shake shack, white castle. they are located in the grand canal shoppes food court inside venetianpalazzo. they have limited seating in the actual counter but theres plenty of seating in the food court. when the no1dp and i were there they had samples of their boneless wings.i got the original anchor bar buffalo wing medium spicy with seasoned smoky chipotle fries and a pepsi 14.50. portion size was big enough for two people. unlike chicken wings ive eaten that comes as a traditional side for pizza or sold in grocery stores, each chicken wing was a fatty mini drumstick. the no1dp said that had he known the portion size was that big he wouldve been happy to share my combo. anchor bar is the only business to do a chicken wing right, equal portion of crispy chicken wing skin and sauce. usually a chicken overwhelmed with sauce is trying to hide the quality of the chicken. each chicken wing was cooked properly. celery sticks were thin but crisp. the bleu cheese sauce isnt strong and is made to complement the wings, celery sticks and fries. fries, though adequately portioned, needed to be more crispy. this is the reason for the 1 star.i had over half my food left so i gave it to two homeless guys camping out in the bridge that connects the palazzo to the wynn. they looked like they needed food more than we did.if split between two people it comes to around 7.25person so i would recommend this as a suitable cheap yet delicious lunchdinner option in the strip. they also serve other flavors of bonein, boneless wings, salads and sandwiches for people who want to make their meals more interesting.
we were happy to find this place in the food court at the venetian. this is the original chicken wing supposedly from the same named bar in buffalo, ny.the wings were, of course, great. they were good sized, seasoned well and the sauce was not overly spicy. my wife and i shared a medium order.we also shared the kale salad. it was good  it had blue cheese, cranberries, nuts and a raspberry vinegarette. my only complaint was that they should chop the kale up a bit more. there were some huge pieces that required some additional tools to not be overwhelming.with all the other options in the food court chipotle, panda express, johnny rockets this place certainly won.
great drunk food, but difficult to find based on the maps within the venetian. after the 3rd employee the boyf and i asked we found this place. the lady gave me way more wings since it was the end of the night and didnt charge for the extra sauce. wasnt a fan of her flirting with the boyf but it was hilarious at the same time.
we just wanted something besides a buffet for dinner, so i found out that the anchor bar was close to our hotel room. it was a chance to try the original chicken wings, and we couldnt pass it up. weve had wingstop, bw3, and other wing restaurants. and i have to say that the anchor bar wings are the best ive ever had. i ordered the single combo with a drink. that was 10 large and meaty wing pieces with a lot of their seasoned fries. you can have your choice of 2 sauces, and there are 3 different fry seasoning you can choose from. i tried the hot and teriyaki sesame sauces, with the ab seasoning on the fries.my wife had the breaded chicken sandwich with hot sauce and fries. we immediately saw that one order of fries would have been enough for both of us. both of us thought that the hot sauce wasnt really very spicy, but we are use to spicy food. the sauces did have good flavor and the wings were fried to perfection.the only reason i didnt give them a 5 star rating is because they had my wing order ready minutes before the sandwich order. so my order had to stay under the heat lamb and wait. my wings and fries were still of a good temperature, so it wasnt that bad. if i could, ill give them 4.5 stars. and theyre open till midnight.
came here while i was staying at the venetian! im glad this place was conveniently close. the reviews are right! these wings are meaty unlike wingstop and pretty dang good. i would most definitely go again if i was staying at the venetian. however, i really wouldnt go out of my way to get wings in vegas here.
i was in yesterday and enjoyed tasting the four beers that they had on tap.  its great to see them brewing their own beer right from the get go and i enjoyed their ipa and ginger beer.  i think they will be coming out with a bunch of new beer styles for tasting in the upcoming months which should be fun to try.  the bartenders are super nice guys and very knowledgeable.  i wish there was more seating and tables especially if i decide to bring in food on future visits.
yay! a new brewery in phoenix! i had a flight of the only four beers they have at the moment. they were all great, but id say the ipa was easily my favorite. they have coffee on tap, which is unique.  small growlers for 10 and a flight for 6 not bad. the thing i really liked about this brewery is that there is no tv and no music playing, yet conversation was enough to give the atmosphere a fun personality. i really enjoyed my visit here!
the ipa is mighty tasty. kinda boring and hipstery though. i bet theyre making a killing at 5 bucks a draft beer.
fun fact: the cactus wren is the arizona state bird. why do you need to know this? you dont, but now you do and youre welcome. this little brewery was originally supposed to be called westward brewing but apparently had to do the ol name switcharoo right before opening. im sure it was due to legal reasons and such, but whatever, i personally like the new name better. why do you need to know this? you dont, but now you do and youre welcome.the first thing i noticed when i arrived is that there was no specifically labeled entrance door. when i walked over to the little houselike building i assumed was the tasting room, i simply held my breath and hoped i wasnt walking into an illegal poker game which i would then have to join in on because you dont simply walk into an illegal poker game and then kindly excuse yourself and leave. you make a tough looking face, join in like youre supposed to be there and hope for the best. disclaimer: i know nothing about illegal poker games. if you accidentally walk in on an illegal poker game, you should not necessarily take my advice and join in. i dont know what you should do, but i hope you make the right choice... i digress... guess what? i chose the right door and the place is actually adorbs. you see, this is how you know not to take my advice on illegal poker games... because i just used the word adorbs. i ordered a flight and the beers are pretty solid for a new brewery. my favorites were the ginger pale ale and the black caddis porter. they dont serve food, but i heard that sometimes they have a food truck come by for your eating needs. all in all it seems to be a good addition to the phoenix craft brewery scene and i personally look forward to coming by again. in the mean time, im going to start learning how to play poker.
came during happy hour. employees were friendly and knowledgeable. 6 beers on tap. they dont sell food. however sometimes have food trucks and you can bring your own food! overall a great place to try at least once.
come here for the tasty beer... they do have food trucks that come in and you can also bring in your food. regarding the beer. really enjoyed the senor gallo... my kind of beer... refreshing, light but good flavors. went through their tasty samplers and there were lots of flood options in there there senor gallo just happened to be my fave of the lot side note, they had this very tasty cold press coffee on tap. tried it mixed with some of the oatmeal stout and gave it a a nice extra jolt
i came here on a saturday around 4:30 and was able to score a seat at the bar. huzzah! the establishment itself is cute, decorated in a minimalisthipsterish way. the lady who was working the bar was friendly and helpful. she allowed me to try a few beers before making a decision as to what i wanted. i tried a variety of beers, the porter, the stout, the wheat beer...the wheat beer tasted almost ipa ish and i didnt care for it. the porter was tasty and i ended up ordering that. the atmosphere was relaxed and they had games available. i would return.
the music was super hipster ... of course it was! i cant listen to hardcore everywhere.  the tap room is really intimate, homegirl was nice. who hit john tho
in side a relaxed hipster style old house is a small bar, that serves beer, beer that they made, and some of the beers i found quite tasty.just a few miles south of trendy is wrenhouse, which could be called beer house as it is literally an old house. there is bar seating, a few tables and a few wing chairs for seating. there are the required hipster edison bulbs, beer and even cold brewed coffee. i found the jomax stout to be truly great, rich and deep with out a burnt flavor, i even tried it with some cold brewed coffee added in and it worked well and was not overpowering. pints range from 56 and from 59 abv
i very much enjoyed my evening with friends here. its a great place where you can find a quality craft brew. they have an excellent variety of craft beers that caters to an array of customers. what i thought was cool about the place is that you can bring your preferred outside food into the establishment. it makes a great environment to hang with friends. speaking of environment, wren house has a very relaxed ambience, complete without pretentious vibes. i recommend it!
nice little brew pub off the beaten path, but worth the trip for their high quality specialty brews. they have two ipas that are super tasty.
i was in there on a sunday afternoon. there was no one in there, but this wont affect my rating. i think this place deserves more customers. it would help if the decor was more creative... it lacks a bit of character or something.  but the food is good and the staff person was super nice. it was fun to be on the patio, although a bit busy for me its on stdenis.... i had a brussels waffle with salty caramel on top with a macchiato. the waffle was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, delicious. the price was very decent.  i plan to go back to try the liege waffles and the crepes.
jai recu un coupon groupon de ce resto et jai decide de lessayer. le service etait chaleureux. jai pris une crepe milano et un cafe flat white. la crepe etait bonne, les ingredients allaient bien ensembles. la vinaigrette sur la salade etait sucree. un bon repas dans lensemble. jusqua ce que je presente le fameux coupon...la jeune caissiere est devenue moins sympathique. jai laisse un bon pourboire. je ne pense pas y retourner.
sunrise taxi. sounds so fictional. like the taxi youd hail in a fictitious town. like pine valley. but anything with the word sun in it is appropriate for phoenix, right?  while most of their vehicles look as though they just left a county fair smash up derby, theyll haul you around the valley of the sun for much cheaper than the other rides. a jaunt from indian school to 16th st. and bethany home runs just under 8. while that same journey in a discount cab, cost close to 13. the key is find a fave driver, get his cell phone, a walla, youre an instant big shot, with a driver at your disposal. why britney spears hasnt caught on to this, ill never understand.
if you drink on a semi regular basis you know that cab fares can add up!  my typical 6 mile ride costs 10 with sunrise and 14 with discount.  from what i can tell, these cabs are all former fire chief 1980s chevys painted white the inside door jams are still red.they are perfect when youve been drinking and are less likely to care about the exhaust fumes and are a great option to driving drunk when you want an inexpensive cab and dont care who sees how you get home.
really nice people. one of the reviewers said they were closed.they are not out of business. great prices too. much cheaper than taking an airport cab. unfortunately the airport has a contract with 3 cab companies and they charged 50 bucks to go to our hotel in paradise valley. they were only 23 but we had to take the rail to the bus stop. no biggie.
after reading the reviews, i decided to schedule a ride to the airport.  not only were they early, their price was roughly half of other cab companies ive taken from the airport!  friendly driver too.  the only reasons they are not a full five stars it that they dont accept credit cards part of keeping their prices so low  they wont pick up from the airport.  the only way is to take a shuttle and meet them at the car rental area.  i will definitely use their services again.  save yourself some money and give them a shot!
i have taken sunrise cab co a few times now and so far i have had nothing but good experiences except for one time. the cabbies are necessarily the most friendly always but its a cheap ride with no surprise charges. the cars are older but its cheap ride home. my average fare from discount is 9 home from my favourite watering hole, my average with sunrise is around 5
prices are reasonable! cabs are not bad.
cheap fares 1.50mile, friendly drivers who will hold a solid conversation if youre into that, and although not pretty  clean  cars make sunrise my only choice for a cab in phoenix. i have dealt with steve and adam, who were both right on time to pick me up and called when they arrived. super nice guys. both seemed to enjoy their jobs and told me that the owners are pretty great, so im all about supporting a company that treats its employees well. way to be, sunrise. thumbs up.
little hidden gem! this is a really cool off the strip bar that is a great location to chill with your friends, eat, and watch live music. mixed drinks are 7 i believe i paid for, and budlights are 3. not too shabby at all. and theres goood asian restaurants around making it a good location to make a night out of. one of the owners jr is so sweet and down to earth too! enjoyed my time here
no garnish on the plates.
great food, good service.  by good i mean not even offering me dessert, but clearing off my table before i even paid, literally handing me my stuff, and saying bye.yeah, thats the look i had on my face too.  the waitress asked finally if anyone checked me out.  im like no, they handed me my shit n cleared the table.work on the .. i cant believe i have to say this .. management of servers and busboys.  do not railroad anyone out of your restaurant !!!  esp if you dont even give them the check first.
when the roadrunner off of centennial parkway and tropical closed it was a hope that they would replace the dive bar with something new and exciting to try, but rarely do we find that occurs in las vegas.  thankfully, that very thing happened for once. the new firerock has opened and to say the least, it is a breath of fresh air in a very stale corner of the city.  we sat at the bar and were very pleased to see an extensive wine, cocktail and beer list, including many signature cocktails and great tap beers. the menu is based on american steakhouse fare and includes a very unique chop salad with a southwestern twist, including a garlic chipotle dressing, roasted hearts of romaine, avocado and corn. i had the jalapeno smash burger with their housemade chips.  the burger is chopped sirloin and is fantastic, as are the chips and housemade fresh salsa they serve on the side. my wife had the caprese salad and found it average in quality. we also decided to try the unique philly steak eggrolls and were blown away. they are unreal in whimsy, flavor and portion. they come with an a1 aioli that is amazing. ask for the liquid cheese to dip with as well and dip in both sauces for an amazing taste explosion!  happy hour at the bar is daily from 46pm and late night from 10pmclose.  it includes halfprice appetizers and oysters rockefeller at 2 per oyster.  the service at the bar was a bit iffy but friendly. they were very busy when we were in so another chance for the service will happily be provided. if you are looking for a fun new spot in the northwest valley give this spot a try. it is well worth it to give them a shot.
food and atmosphere are great! staff is friendly and service was good. great happy hour prices and the regular prices are great as well. the only down side is the water. the water tastes terrible and needs some major filtering. it has a very bad chemical and metal taste. if it wasnt for the water id give it a 5. overall at this point 4.5.
a great experience!!  beautiful new restaurant with friendly staff and good food. our server jess was the best.  we were given an ipad for a drink and dessert menu which i thought was pretty cool. there was a wide variety of menu items on the food menu. steaks, burger, pasta, seafood, chops, chicken and sandwiches.  reasonably priced but when you get to the steaks the prices increase of course.  i had the beef tenderloins and the flavor was good but the meat was a little tough. well for me and my dentures it was lol.  i tasted my sisters beer can chicken and it was delicious!!  we didnt get to dessert but they do have creme brulee!!
the only reason im not giving them 5 stars is because my bacon wrapped filet was missing its bacon. that being said the filet by itself was amazing! i had the white cheddar mashed potatoes  house salad which were great additions to the filet. my husband had the cajon ribeye, on recommendation of our bartender alyson, which was cooked great  very flavorful. it wasnt overly seasoned  had the right amount of char.we ended up eating at the bar because the restaurant was packed on this friday night. it was the right amount of attentiveness  being able to take our time with dinner. we appreciated alysons knowledge of the bar as well as the food menu. we will definitely return! just wish you were in summerlin!
we dined at this lovely place just last night and am thrilled to have such a wonderful place up here in the nw valley!  service was great, food was excellent and we will definitely be return customers!  the only minor complaint i would put here is that a friend ordered an irish coffee and it came as a regular cup of coffee with the liquor in it!  i have never seen that presented that way....but as a whole we were very, very pleased!
the steaks are good here. fire grilled and you can taste it in the meat. staff is very attentive. heather was our server and she was awesome. carpaccio was a little bland but ok. porterhouse and bone in rib eye were delicious. they were both cooked perfect. they have the temperature correct. im looking forward to returning to try more items.
tried it for the 1st time last night. the food and our waiter sammy was excellent. giving it four stars because i believe the hostesses could be a little more inviting. will definitely be back!!
after reading other reviews i would have to agree with some of the comments about new and needing to sort out the kinks. we had 4 in our group and they managed to mix up the sides. this would be a big issue, if the food was not good. i would hope that when i go back that the problems are sorted and the standards have been kept.i would advise you to avoid being seated in the bar area as the noise from the bar patrons is loud.we had a good server who reminded us about happy hour and saved us some dollars. not five but could be.
love this place. the seared ahi and firecracker shrimp is the best. service is great and super friendly.  will come back again and again.
dearhubby and i have been there 3 times now, and the third visit is the sole reason for the lack of five stars. not sure if thats totally fair, but theyre the ones who employed the server who knocked our love of firerock down a notch.first visit, about 3 weeks ago, for dinner:server, amanda, was nice and welcoming, we both got steaks that were perfectly prepared along with the firecracker shrimp appetizer. everything was fabulous, left fat  happy.second visit, about 2 weeks ago, for dinner:server, amanda again, remembered us and was still efficient and pleasant. dh got another steak and i got the mahi piccata, along with the seared ahi appetizer. everything was great, though the sauce on the appetizer was a bit overwhelming for me after a bit  would have preferred it on the side so i could have had a bit less on each bite. still, we left fat  happy again.third visit, a couple days ago, for late lunch:server; dena, seriously wanted us to order the philly cheesesteak eggrolls, but we wanted the crab cake. she tried again, telling us that we only get one crab cake, we repeated our order. she left to put that order in while i was starting to give her the rest of my order. oh well. philly cheesesteak eggrolls were delivered and refused. she took the rest of our order, whiskey burger and beet salad, and our crab cake was delivered. it was fine, but then dena arrived and muttered told you that you should have ordered something else. really? okay, fine.. food arrived, burger is monstrous and dh only ate half. beet salad was good for the first couple of bites but the ricottahoney mixture got to be too much and scraped it off, then just plain couldnt take another bite of it.. just too much for me. we wanted our check, dena was too busy chatting with the hostesses but eventually deigned to come to our table. gave me the third degree as to why i hadnt eaten part of dhs burger. we left unfulfilled and irritated by dena.yes, well be back.. but if it turns out were being seated in denas section, we will ask to be relocated. if we get amandas, well rejoice.
this steakhouse is a place i would really like to succeed. they do steaks very well. however, i had the black and blue burger  ordered medium it came out well done and dry. had the lobster and mac, lobster was perfect the mac was dry, no cream and wrong cheese. tried the artichoke appetizer, the bread was harder than a rock. on a positive note, steaks are awesome, staff is awesome, the baked bread was awesome. this place needs to work on the other items on the menu. do everything with the same attention you give your steaks and you have a winner. please work on those burgers. i like burgers for lunch and those beautiful steaks for dinner. make those burgers thick and juicy. your place looks great! you just need to fine tune some.
excellent food and happy hour. beautiful atmosphere. good service. we had very good ribs and the strawberry salad with large grilled shrimp. it is about time that centennial had one good restaurant.
good but still needs some work....we had a good lunch with just a couple of quibbles.  arrived  12:20 on tuesday, finding only 45 tables in use. welcomed  seated promptly. nice ambiance wjazz music playing...just loud enough to be noticeable but easy to talk over.  we have to say service from server anjanette was xcellent.  she is a keeper. she knew the menu  answered questions about some items, with highly helpful  friendly manner. also was very much on the ball with beverage refills. our only service quibble seemed not her fault...for such little business at the time and for what we ordered it seemed it took a bit long for the kitchen to produce.   i had the ny strip sandwich sans mushrooms, cooked just right, reasonably tender and nice size. it had good flavor.  the side dish of pineapple  strawberries was a welcome  tasty option.     my guest ordered the fish  chips, which she said were good. the chips were good but the accompanying cole slaw was a small portion of greens with little flavor  no vinegar, so that definitely needs work.  the fish was good and cooked right but nothing special overall.     there are some other menu items of interest we will return to try after definitely giving them a bit more shakedown time.  the potential here is great and firerock was much needed in the neighborhood so were happy theyve come.
we tried the happy hour at firerock steakhouse.   i gotlacrema chardonnay it was not as buttery as i hoped but 12 off so it was ok.  favorite half off appetizer are:1.  firecracker shrimp wonderful and delicious 5.952. bbq pork nacho huge!! can feed many 4.97 best deal!3. lettuce wraps very nice could have more lettuce  4.974.  street tacos least favorite and most expensive  6.95self seated and wait staff was ok.. brittany was ok. we had the street tacos and had to send back because of the cold stale and the lettuce was brown.. when she replaced it... still not good.   everything else was nice.  happy hour was busy for a wednesday evening.. i think they are still working out the new restaurant issues.
my new go to restaurant in the nw.  great service. nice variety on the menu, and terrific food.
we had 730 dinner reservations and only had to wait 2 minutes to be seated. jess was our waitress and she was great. cant complain about the service but the environment was too loud for my husband. overall a solid b
went for happy hour and it was great. arrived at 4 on a wed. seated right away in bar area and service was fast a d friendly. ordered several appetizers with the drinks. food was good and everything was on happy hour prices.  nice setting and atmosphere.  will definite go back for dinner.
decided to give firerock a try friday night.  upon entering to visit with the hostess the bar was packed and several tables were seated.  after a few moments wait our group was seated near the back of the restaurant in a booth.  looking around at the room checking out the decor i notice they have a lot of photos and artwork of cows and western themed pieces.  firerock definitely is a slight step up from casual dining but not quite fine dining status.  they do however have a private party room off to the left of the entrance with seating for at least 20 peeps.  service started with beverages and some complimentary fresh baked buttery herb dinner rolls.  these were warm and very tasty start to our meal.browsing the menu i had trouble deciding on what to get because there were so many different things that had me salivating.  after seeking a recommendation from the server i decided to settle on the chicken dijonnaise as my entree with grilled asparagus and white cheddar mashed potatoes. this dish tasted as good as it sounds.  the panko breading was crisp and flavorful and the breast was large enough for me to take home a lunch portion for the next day.  the mashed potatoes were seasoned well and i enjoyed the occasional lumps in the creamy fluffiness. the grilled asparagus was a perfect al dente and nice side item offering. we also selected the sundried tomato  basil pasta with a light garlic and wine sauce.  i liked the freshness of the basil in the dish however the sundried tomatoes flavor seemed a little off. normally these are sweet little bits of garden candy.  dont get me wrong the dish was still tasty with its large slice of garlic bread on the side.  once again another large portion that we had to take home to enjoy the next day.  i added a side salad to my chicken entree which was just ok.  i was slightly underwhelmed with the amount of toppings which were diced so small it was hard to enjoy.  overall not enough toppings of cucumber, tomato, egg, and bacon.  even the dressing was a little to light.  service from the staff was lightning fast. almost uncomfortable because he would come in to the table so quickly with hi how are we doing and then phew! he was gone.  i had to stop and have a conversation just make it feel like we were be attended to.  this was fine but sometimes when the staff run so frantically they either have to many tables or are understaffed. overall experience was positive.  i would definitely recommend giving firerock a try.  the atmosphere was lively on a friday night, food was good and service was expedited quickly.  i wanna try and come for happy hour from 46pm where drinks and apps are half price.
closet place you can go in centennial hills for a good steak. without driving down to the strip or sumnerlin to go to a nice restaurant.   i normally order their premium meats because of the taste.  a good steak is one that does not require any sauce you have to pour on it.  the staff was very attentive.  i recommend you call ahead or youll be waiting awhile as the entire centennial hills community will be waiting to be seated.
first, thank you for taking a risk at this building that seemed to lack stability. i cant even recall how many have come and go at this location. this review is a combination of 3 visits. so, ive had a taste of staff and various menu items.  the staff is friendly and willing so no negative feedback in this area.  i want to talk about the food.  i did find the history of this company before it opened and didnt pay attention to the menu much until i came in person. all i can say is holy cow. its too big. we dont have time to be this confused.  okay, the food ..... appetizer  seared ahi tuna. fresh tuna not slimy at all, crispy greens, great sauce that wasnt too salty and full of asian flavor but it was swimming in too much sauce, it was soup at the end. i would order this again. beet salad with honey and pistachios  crispy and sticky, full of flavor and i will order this again also.  my husband had the ny strip steak, my son had the wyoming whiskey.  they said great flavor and cooked right. husband said fries slightly under done and soggy and would order them well done next time.  i tried both the mac  cheese and lobster mac  cheese.  i ended up getting both because of an order mix up . at this point i will have to give this another chance because after eating these side by side i cant say if my taste buds were able to distinguish what was going on with either one of these. my dad had the turkey avocado club and didnt come up for air. all visits included adult beverages where the bar staff is excellent. thats going to keep this place alive here.  the menu could be streamlined for our lifestyle here we just dont have the attention span or time of those who live in wyoming.  keep up the effort and hard work and well keep coming back and recommending this place.
for the food we got, it was awesome! service was good and cant complain. however the bartender on shift didnt know wtf he was doing. i ordered a 12 year old scotch straight up and it came back to me on ice! even if i asked for it to be on the rocks you dont fill the entire glass!
came here last night for some late dinner and to try out the food again. we like to sit at the bar and we had the same bartender as last time. he is great. super friendly, helpful and very on top of ordering the food and bringing it out. we ordered the sampler platter, salads and the blue cheese burger. a lot of food...yes. the sampler platter was okay. i like the stuff mushrooms, but the rest was alright. the blue cheese burger here is super good. the only thing i would change is the bread. its very spongeyish. i would like to have softer bread, but the patty itself is awesome. happy to come back and try out some other stuff. but again  the music. good god, its horrible here. last night, it was 80s...and not the good 80s music. also, it was super cold. it had to be on like 65 degrees and we were freezing. im always cold and my boyfriend is always hot. and if hes cold, you know its got to be freezing.
been here twice now and have enjoyed both visits.  first time ordered the street tacos with a wedge salad and enjoyed them.  they were filling even though they are on the appetizer menu.  the second time i ordered the mahi meniguere.  that was amazing.  would order that again.  there fresh bread is excellent as well.  my daughter ordered the prime rib the first visit and then the top sirloin the second visit since they were out of the prime rib and she said she preferred the prime rib over the sirloin.  both visits we had a larger party and the service was good.  will definitely go back.
had the prime rib which was good. baked potato was large. my wife had the sirloin which was not good. it had no flavor at all. waiter was excellent. i will try again. nice restaurant inside as well
came for the first time and i really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, my only complaint was the service.  they messed up my order twice, but its ok i understand when a new place opens there still getting it together.
we love the atmosphere and the attitude of the staff. especially the manager donny.we never get a table but eat in the bar regularly. we always enjoy our visits and he usually make time to come and socialize. this is part of why we keep coming back!
first timers! so excited to have a new steakhouse in our neighborhood. we sat at the bar and the service was excellent on a somewhat busy night. wonderful filet, yet it needed seasoning. my scallops were over cooked, but the sauce was delicious. they served yummy rolls with our dinner as well. we will be going back, huge selection on their menu. plus the sangria was one of the best ive ever had!
had a surprise guest travelling through town, so with nothing in the fridge to fix, we headed out to find a decent place to eat and do a lot of catching up. my bf recalled driving by this place, so armed with yelp reviews, thought wed  try fire rock. so glad we did!  at first, i wasnt sure what to expect because its kind of a hybrid mix of neighborhood bar and fancy steakhouse.   our server was friendly, but kind of flitted between tables, so they must have been short staffed that night.  it also took a long time to get our drinks. but what was lacking in timely service was sure made up for in the gargantuan, fantastically seasoned cajun butter ribeye bonein steaks.  oh my my!  who cared about the pain that came before, when these luscious slabs of tender beef showed up!  cant even recall how good the garlic mashed potatoes or saauteed mushrooms were, they were so totally overshadowed by the great steaks.  we ate until it hurt and still had leftover  boxes to cart home.  even the two men in our group couldnt finish their steaks.  give it a try, just expect perfection in the meal because they could do no wrong there!  yes, we recommend it and yes we are going to return!
this place recently opened up near our home in centennial hills, and i had been hearing good things about it.  we hadnt been to a steakhouse in a while, so we decided to give it a try last night.  my first impression was....wow, this place is much bigger on the inside than on the outside!.   we were greeted promplty and taken to a booth by a hostess.  our waiter was adorable.... his name was daryl.  i remember his name because he wrote it on our tablecloth with a crayon.   the menu was pretty extensive, and the prices seemed reasonable.   daryl brought us some bread, and it was delicious. hubby ordered a ribeye, daughter had a chicken cobb salad, and i had steak medalions served in a mushroom gravy on top of mashed potatoes.  everything was wonderful!  cooked to perfection  and very flavorful.  portions were fair.... although my daughters salad was enormous.  her biggest complaint was that everything was piled on so high it was impossible to mix the salad without everything falling off of the plate.   we really enjoyed the food, and the service was really good, too!  we will definitily be back.
diane and i had a nice first experience here with another couple.  buttery freshbaked rolls were fetching and delicious.  dinner salad with bacon and diced egg was good but i would have preferred more french dressing.  a cup of french onion soup was also good and gooey, but salty.  moist and mostly lean short rib ragout finished with a savory veal  wine gravy was nicely tossed with fettuccine.  smothered chicken showing glimpses of ham and melted provolone through a covering of white wine cream sauce was somewhat unique and inviting.  prices were reasonable, and service friendly and efficient.ambiance was fireside western.  the only drawback noted was the place was packed, and the high level of noise from the expansive bar near the restaurant entrance carried into the dining room deeper inside.
good food at reasonable prices.  service was great.  steak comes with a side and salad.  i was at a table of 6 people  and the service was great.
third time here and just as great. i had the prime rib and the misses had the top serloin. the bonus today was the seafood chowder! very good! see you next time!
great little spot to grab a great steak!  the bread is fantastic as are the lettuce wraps. really nice happy hour specials until 6 pm. a bit loud and hard to chat.  one star down for that.!
my wife and i decided to grab dinner here. awesome place to eat. price is reasonable that keeps it competitive with olive garden, but the quality at fire rock is so much better. the tomato soup with beef is to die for! the bread is amazing. my prime rib came out perfect. only thing i didnt like was the long wait time. however, the wait is worth it!
im so glad i tried this place despite the mixed reviews.  now, they say they take reservations but they only take it for party of 8 or more only, so be ware!  now, they put me on the wait list over the phone, which was great and we got there just in time but ended up waiting 20minutes more, which i wasnt happy about.nevertheless!  the food was great and the manager came around to meet and greet so we enjoyed it overall!  we really needed a good steak house in centennial and this place fills that gap well ;
i love the options. it is busy so go early! we had to sit at the bar and the service was fairly slow. there was one gentlemen that wasnt serving us and ended up being more helpful then our server. i was surprised that it was a gaming restaurant. over all decent food. we will go back.
atmosphere is great. light background music not too loud although every once in awhile there was some loud butt rock that was played weird.  spacious layout so you dont feel like you are right on top of other patrons.  server was rick.  he was very friendly and professional.  prices are commensurate with other steakseafood places.started with stuffed mushrooms.  they were really good and only 5 on happy hour menu.  i had the mushroom swiss burger.  it was cooked nicely but didnt have much flavor.  my wife had the ribs and shrimp.  the ribs were pretty bland too.  the shrimp was good. we also had the firecracker shrimp, which was really good.  kids corn dogs were good and came with a generous portion of fruit.
atmosphere was great. service was awesome! food was soso. i did not care for the smothered chicken, seemed like a piece of chicken topped with lunch meat and way to much melted cheese. my husband ordered the beer can chicken and did not care for it either. we will try it again and avoid the chicken.
first visit was great, since it was new the place wasnt busy but we had about 20 of us go in and they handled everything wonderfully. the food was great and came out quickly.
great spot! first time here and i was with a wedding party. great staff. i plan on going back again, when time permits
i love this place. the food is incredible, and you definitely get a lot for your money. weve been there 4 times now, and its one of our favorites! there has been nothing on the menu we didnt like. the only thing i have a complaint about is that they need better bar service, it takes for ever to get a drink! we also had dinner in the bar one night, and the service was terrible! do yourself a favor and wait for a table! this place is fantastic, and the food is amazing!
came here right after they opened, they had a few bugs to workout, but for the couple things that werent quite right they went above and beyond to make right, food was great, i see potential for this place, keep it up, we need a good place to eat out on this side of town besides bar food.
atmosphere was great ... for this quality of restaurant, i was disappointed in the service ... the steak was not very tender ... i ordered the steak and shrimp ... next time, i will just order the shrimp.
ive stayed here a few times recently, and was pleasantly surprised but how nice, and comfortable the rooms are....nice remodel, friendly staff, good breakfast. only complaint i have, and i understand its a common complaint amongst their guest, is that the shower never gets hotter than lukewarm...no matter what time of day. the sink faucet does get nice and hot, but not the shower. i wish they would increase the temp...goosebumps during a shower isnt good. otherwise, great stay!!
i wish there were more interactive tanks i loved the starfish interactive tank. it is geared toward small children but the admission price is a little steep for me. my daughter said she wouldnt pay to go in if she was hanging out with her friends. the food i had some coleslaw, chicken strip with a dipping sauce, a slice of apple with a cream cheese and heath bar dip. yummy! we each got a bag of candy. my sun loved the little passbook he could stamp when he learned the fun facts and he was amazed with the shark tank. a friend and i spoke with tonya the photographer very nice loved her hair! some of the computers went down while we tied to interact on the different fish types. that was a great event to end our vacation!?!
i really enjoyed my 1st yelp event! everything was setup nicely and things seemed to have run smoothly!! also it wasnt too overcrowded. i was handed a stamp book when i walked in, but it wasnt explained how to use it. it wasnt until id passed 3 stations that i saw that i was supposed to stamp along the way and so i went back to the beginning to get my stamps because i wanted to give my book to my god son. the cutest little boy helped me  came over to stamp a few of them throughout the exhibit. everyone was so friendly!! staff  attendees!! the food  candy were tasty! it def knocked the edge off my growling tummy. i loved the shell painting station by the way though my shell didnt come out that cute lol. i love the free swag bag! my first piece of yelp gear!! now the event i enjoyed, the aquarium was just ok in my opinion. im not sure id spend money to come back, especially at their steep prices. but the kids seemed to enjoy the aquarium. i got a souvenir coin from the machine on the way out. cant wait for the next event!
kelly spots lionfish. cece!!!!!!! new girl reference....anyone?first family friendly yelp event, success! there were a ton of people here. i arrived right at 6pm, and walked around the corner to the back of the line. selfishly, i had hoped for an elite easy pass, but once the event started, the line moved pretty quickly. i was really excited for this event, i love all things aquariumzootouresque. i did not bring a child with me though, which definitely put me in the minority. did it stop my passport stamping, starfish petting self? absolutely not. i did however, opt out of the stand by yourself and smile for sealife so you can buy your photo after moment. while the aquarium was full of yelpers, i was glad i hung back a little, to check out every tank, play in the touch tank, eat by the sharks and rays and give myself some breathing room. the food was delicious. i was really pleased with the slaw and apple dip. the candy was a nice touch too, but it was hot in the foodshark tank  room. my mms stuck to the bottom of my candy bag. with fans going though, it wasnt too bad, just lots of body heat. in this area also lives their octopus  who, side note, is learning to paint. what?! awesome.the aquarium itself is set up nicely, i read in another review that they have a bunch of room to expand. the staff was friendly and informative throughout the event. but when i went back for the behind the scenes tour, they seemed a little flustered. but with that amount of wandering people, i cant blame them. im surprised that this aquarium gets a good turn out with their steep prices. if you could find online or discounted pricing, it would be a fun little date night or outing with kids. thank you nikki for putting this fun opportunity together! thank you to pdq for the quick bite. and as always, it was great to see tonya with poprock  always rocking awesome color and photos.
this was a nice family event! a little tasting from pdq and some candy which the kids loved. it was interesting to see all of this inside a mall. loved the end with the arts for kids to do. and of course it was great to see tonya again!
who would imagine an aquarium in at the concord mills mall? this is the most unique yelp event that included food, drinks, adventure for the whole family to enjoy and educational too. children and kids of all ages running around following the sting rays with their smiley faces to greet you as they swim up to you. sharks swimming above you and schools of fish as if your are in an encased glass submarine x feet below sea level.did you touch one of the starfishes? wow! texture and feel not what i anticipated. soft and not rough. did you see its belly with all those tentacles when the starfish was upside down. watch out for the territorial blue fish that swims around the starfishes. lol...they do not bite.this is such an interactive aquarium. learned so much just by visiting.thank you nikki for hosting this awesome event. great local events for the community to know what is out there and fun for the whole family.great sponsors pdq fresh tenders salads sandwiches and yummy candy from sugar pops candy.
this side of town was sorely needing good coffee other than dunkin donuts.  its a walkupdrivethru, but it works.the great attitude found at dutch bros is almost unmatched for the area. theyll send extra employees out to expedite if the walkup line is more than a few people. fast and friendly, too.vegassmart menu also has smoothies, frappes, and other cold summerfriendly options, both caffeinated and non. try the cocomo!and theyre open 247.
the dutch mafia has arrivedi paid a quick visit to dutch bros. coffee on my way to work this morning.  id never heard of this oregonian coffee chain until it was the talk of the town this past weekend with the grand opening and free 16 oz. drinks being given away.  i pulled in right before 7:00am and there was one car in the drivethru lane and no one at the walkup window, which i used.  not usually one for the fancy blended drinks with loads of sugar, i told the friendly employee that i usually go with an almond milk latte and thats what i got.  i like the fact that dbc even offers almond milk as an option, as well as soy and coconut milks for .50 upcharge.  and speaking of friendly, the other two employees there came to the window to greet me with huge smiles.  i received a 2for1 card to use on my next visit as well as one of their punch cards: buy 10 drinks and the 11th is free.  i believe the 2for1 card was just luck and todays special giveawayyahoo!  my drink was as enjoyable as my first visit.  who doesnt appreciate great customer service and coffee, especially when the company adopted something called the optimists creed as its own?  that optimism certainly shows.with dbcs plans to expand into vegas with up to 35 stores, i look forward to there being one near me.  until then, ill be using that 2for1 card sooner than later and visiting this location when im in the area.  stay dutch.
a new coffee shop opened on the east side of town, so i had to check it out. the place is small and parking is limited. theres only two options to get your order: walkup or drivethru  no going inside and no outdoor seating. parking is small and a little awkward to get out of especially when theres a lot of cars around. i had the iced annihilator, and i must admit the coffee was actually pretty good. it wasnt overbearingly sweet, and still had that yummy coffee taste. the flavor in their drinks was perfectly rationed. its a great way to cool off from the desert heat and satisfy your coffee cravings. this new coffee joint is easily one of the better coffee places on this side of town. i dont think you would be disappointed in trying this out!all staff was pretty friendly, and the menu was small but had a lot of choices infused teas, smoothies, and small little grabngo snacks. its also opened 24 hours, so you can get your coffee fix anytime you want. ill probably end up going here for coffee whenever im on this side of town.
i tried this place when i went to portland last year and fell in love with the coffee.  i was so happy to hear that they were expanding here to las vegas!   i hope they open some locations on the west side.  one thing i really remember is that they had plenty of help and were very fast there and this one is no different.  i dont know the name of the girl who waited on me, but she was super nice and was very happy to help me.  the line was long at the drive thru, so i went to the walkup window.  the only reason i dont give it five stars is i dont remember it being 4 plus for a large coffee in portland.  and as much as id like to have it as my daily cup, i cannot swing that price tag every day.  i will stick with my 1 for a larger size at dunkin, but i will definitely come here a couple of times a month, especially if im in that area of vegas!
really good iced coffee.  my fave is the kokomo.  they serve up really oldfashioned customer service. imagine being in a small town  stopping in a neighborhood diner and chatting about all kinds of small talk with all the people working there.  i liked it at first, but some days you just wanna drive thru without waiting for the car ahead of you to finish their small talk...some days you just want to grab your joe and go. lol
is their coffee great? its good....but i like madhouse or hollys cuppa better. but their customer service is outstanding! even on a scorching hot 105 degree day, the workers here were very welcoming. we walked up to the window and let the guy taking our order know this was our first time. keep in mind, there is no inside seating. its literally a coffee stand. there is a drive thru however. so he briefly went over the menu and let us know which drinks are the most popular. in the end, he said our drinks were on the house since its our first time.  talk about leaving us a lasting impression!!! theres one way to make us come back for more.i ordered a small iced kicker which is their original coffee with a blend of irish cream and i requested nonfat milk. it was delicious. i cant stand sweet high caloric drinks like blended fraps with mocha chocolate drizzle etc.... this was perfect for me....not too sweet. my boyfriend got a small iced americano...which is like an expresso drink. he ordered it with light sweetener and small room for cream. he loved it and even said the unthinkable: this is better than starbucks iced coffee. o_o wow!!! strong statement coming from an almost daily starbucks drinker. so thats saying something....we will definitely be back. im curious to try a few other drinks. something with coconut in it. maybe their teas also.
stopped by at 2pm. too bad this isnt a sit down coffee shop. but the customer is pretty impressive. im not a coffee expert but i did enjoy the caramelizer.
i hope these employees are paid decently because they are excellent at customer service. when they chat with you, its like youre old bffs catching up for the first time in years. they earn and deserve every tip, just for being a bit of extra sunshine.the caramelizer with coconut milk is such a treat on a hot summer day. i look forward to trying more flavors and will certainly do so when im in the unlv area.
ive tried a whole variety a coffee; from mcdonalds, coffee bean, einsteins, and of course starbucks.. and im sad enough to say that this is also just another regular coffee for me. nonetheless, it still did not disappoint me! although, ive only tried the cocomo, i do like it enough to try a different kind; i could change my mind! its definitely worth a try.service: very quick, which i strongly appreciate. employees: very friendly : 4 stars because a place like this should be in a better location!
i tried this place because a friend of mine was so excited about them coming to vegas and had nothing but great things to say about them. the prices are great, the people that work there seem to genuinely love working there, and the coffee is good! what more could you ask for? i cant wait for them to open one in my part of town so i can go more often!
all drinks can be made iced, hot or blended. dont think you have to order the freeze or frost for a blended treat! we ordered the kicker and the freeze. if youre looking for a sugar coma get the kicker in a blended version instead of the freeze. drinks are either ordered through drive through or walk up. get a stamp card and get your 10 drink free any size, any drink!
i happened to be on this side of town for work and had to finally give this place a try after driving by. i like how you order at the window instead of through a speaker, always have issues with the one at starbucks so talking to a human in person without having to get out of my car was convenient. i ordered the double torture since i was exhausted and needed the extra caffeine but it had no vanilla flavor to it, just straight up espresso which was disappointing and i ended up throwing it away later. i did love the muffin top, most delicious muffin top ive ever had in my life. even with the coffee i didnt enjoy i still spent less than i would at starbucks! when i mentioned it was my first time they gave me a punch card with an extra stamp to get me closer to my free drink after 10! i wish i lived closer but if i ever have the time i will drive out of my way to come back here just for that muffin!!! ;
so i heard about this place because my bestfriend visited oregon  had it there. i honestly was skeptical about this place since i know 2 localvegas places that already sell great coffee. however, this place sells outstanding iced coffees. i got a small kicker 3.25, and its not too sweet nor too bitter. you can definitely taste the irish cream, because its something ive never had in my life, and i finished my iced coffee within minutes. i like how they were fast with making the drinks, and i like how they spark up conversation while you wait for your drink. great service! the location is about 2miles from unlv, so ill probably be visiting this place more often!
really really good coffee and shakes.
i didnt understand the hype when everyone and their momma was beyond excited that a location was opening in las vegas. on a whim, i decided to try their drive thru location on tropicana. we went at 5:00pm on the 4th of july. the person taking our order was chipper and detailed. when we pulled up to the window, we noticed that every employee was dressed up in red, white and blue in celebration of our nations birth. not only that, they were thoroughly enjoying their job, dancing around while making our concoctions. the gal at the window same gal who took our order made small talk while we waited, she even recommended another drink to try the next time we stopped by, based on what we had ordered that day and what she thought we might enjoy. i got the annihilator, and my son got the green apple she suggested him getting the caramel apple next visit, which he did and he loved. she started a frequent flyer stamp card and even added extra stamps due to it being a holiday. we drove off happy. the product was delicious. just the right amount of coffee and sweet, and not too slushy. the green apple slush was perfectly made as well, and not too sweet andor sour. now i see the hype, and wonder, what took so long to get a dutch bros to vegas?
im not an everyday coffee drinker, but on a hot summer day, ill occasionally enjoy an iced latte, iced americano, or a an iced chai tea latte. ive had the kicker here, and it is strong. theres a ton of irish cream, and some sweetness that makes it just right. the chai tea was also really good. my fave is the chai tea latte from starbucks, and this one was somewhat close. 5 for a large cup is a steal. the people are super friendly and will talk to you for a while as you wait for your drink. the drivethrough was unnecessarily held up however, as a customer was having a long convo even after getting their drink. this was holding up the line for an additional 5 minutes with 6 cars lining up behind me in the meantime. i sure will be back to try their other items.
about 6 miles from the strip, we decided to drive away from the hundreds of places available to us on the strip for something different and this place had amazing reviews. there is no place to sit inside, its mostly drive thru only and pick up and go from the window, so that was a bit disappointing. but the coffee was good. not many options if youre hungry but plenty of choices if you like coffee.
i made my first pilgrimage to dutch bros. coffee this weekend.  the iced mocha was good and my friend liked the regular coffee as well.  abby was friendly albeit service seemed a little slow at walk up while drive thru seemed to be moving well probably aided by having an order taker on the drive.  the challenge i have is i am not usually around this east area location and i would rather have an indoor seating option.  i am not sitting outside in 105 degree lv heat at tables that dont even have umbrellas or some sort of shade cover.
talk about deja vu but in totally awesome way! not more then couple weeks ago got introduce to this california caffeine wonderland called dutch bros. coffee. who would have thought come back to vegas that all of sudden dutch bros. coffee invade vegas.  talk about excited. the only downfall was knowing that it was located on the opposite side of town from my house. so taking me while but finally made it out. i can tell you never been more excited driving in vegas summer heat just for iced coffee drink before knowing that dutch bros coffee. the best part was the fact that the quality, experience, and everything that loved about the first time in california was exactly the same. not often comes to chains see that consistency. sure you expect it but sometimes different city, different state, and different workers never know. right off the worker at the window went walk up window she was all positive vibes, happy, and get excited drink coffee. most people do the drive thru since not really any sitting area. they do have some tables outside. most are in the sun but on table on the side that in shade depending on the time of the day. really if pick the right time great spot to chill over great coffee, talking stories, and this day chilling with another yelper suzy h. i got the large. i think they should come up with another name with caffeine overload. out of all the other major chains nothing they have on this large. the best part never have enough of good thing in life. large is great!!!i went with the white chocolate mocha. it was tasty.i wish they had one on the my side of town. still i would make the drive really for any dutch bros coffee in life. they have stamp card program 10 and the 11th is free.
im a fan, after first experiencing dutch bros up in davis, ca, a couple of weeks ago.  being back in vegas for the third time so far this summer, i had to go to dutch bros there.  my daughter and i like the caramelmocha iced drink forgot the name. my hubby had a smoothie.  my daughter and i had our first timers free drinks in vegas, but forgot about it until after we paid.  thats when the server asked if it was anyones first time.  face palm, we told her that yes, its hubbys.  instead of refunding the price of his drink, she gave us a punch card with a couple of extra punches.  not enough for the free firsttimers drink.  so bummed about that but i will search out dutch bros when theres one nearby.
you really cant beat 1.50 iced coffee.  staff is always friendly.  they really go out of their way to provide fast service.  during the busy morning rush, the staff actually comes to your car to take your order.
great customer service, overhyped drinks, and a terrible location pretty much sums it up for me. report card:customer service: aproduct:  b more like a blocation: cgpa in yelp terms 3.75 because they are nice, they deserve a quarter pity star.  im torn with this rating, but i sure remember what it feels like to get a c in school and wishing it was a b. drinks tried:1 iced kicker  irish cream blend. probably my favorite, but...see below2 iced annihilator  the notes of chocolate macadamia are not easily detected. wished it had a nuttier flavor.3 iced caramelizer  good, but not great. a bit weak on the caramel flavor. 4 dutch freeze kicker  disappointment. pretty to look at, but a very confusing drink. the irish cream that i really liked was overpowered by all the chocolate syrup. then...there was hints of a peanuty flavor. wtf, i sure hope they are cleaning their blenders thoroughly. ...but all the drinks are way too sweet. thats coming from someone with a sweet tooth. first couple sips pass with flying colors, then the sugar overload makes my teeth hurt! no other drinks or sweets ever do that too me : this happened all 3 times i went.  my husband says, ...but they are better than dunkin or starbucks! ok fine. well be back then.
sigh....im in.ive tried to resist the lure of dutch brothers coffee dbc and i was wholly prepared to taste their product and declare them ok. sometimes the hype around a place has the opposite effect on me. im overly critical and ready to announce my contrary opinion to those that will listen. so you can imagine my readiness to be entirely unimpressed with this new 247 coffee stand on trop. but dutch brothers is doing something that so few businesses in this town are doing. are even trying to do. heck, or even know that they should be doing.so lets start there. the customer service at dbc is outstanding. out. standing. i dont care what theyre serving, they make you want to pop in just to get a shot of positivity. they just happen to have some yummy coffeeteafrappwhatevers as well. ive stopped by 4 times since   my first trip. and every single time, without fail, the employees kindness, concern, and actual interest in creating a pleasing experience leaves me feeling better when i arrived. that is what businesses are or should be trying to do. i honestly think their teacoffee concoctions are fine. just fine. not much better or worse than the other famous place.  i dont drink coffee very often, so ive had one coffee drinkblendedwhatever and a few chai teas. and ive been pleased. but my fellow chai lovers need to know that the chai flavor is never as strong as id like. nor as spicy. but they are sweet and good and because of all my stamp cards, really reasonable. so i will definitely keep going back for the drinks when im ready for a shot of sugar and whatever else goes into those drinks. but i will always come back for the service. and im so glad to see that new businesses are paving the way for what proper service can be in this town. its located in a working class area near the university. i skimmed a few reviews that seemed to marginalize the location. that fauxsuperior position diminishes the community that surrounds the space and speaks to something greater than a simple concern for the neighborhood. if you need to be surrounded by highend cars in the waiting line and beautiful people at a driveup coffee shop, then you are missing out on more than a great new business.  and this review may not be for you. a sugar coffee drink is a sugar coffee drink in my eyes. so i wont be a regular. but when i am craving a sugar jolt with some iced tea mixed in, i choose you, dbc. i choose you.
really good. i had the pumpkin frosty shake. i would say this is more of a beverage desert shop than a coffee shop which is good for me.
i love this place. 3rd time here.  always greeted with a smile which is very refreshing.  everything that i have tried has been delicious.  if i was to offer a critique; sometimes the girl in the drive thru window chats a little to long when there is a line and by the time its your turn your beverage has melted. lol. check it out.  you wont be disappointed.  they also offer a frequent shopper card where after your 10th beverage purchase your 11th is free.
chain with a local feel!im a grouchys girl at heart, but dutch bros. is pretty awesome. dutch bros. has a selection of hot, cold and noncaffeinated drinks smoothie, etc. similar to what youd see at any chain.  i usually order blended drinks, which usually tend to be more like milkshakes. in the dutch bros. drinks, you can actually taste the coffee. service is friendly and quick. the employees actually attempt to get to know you, which i love. the prices are reasonable, and taxes are included! if im in the area, i make it a point to stop by. you should too!
dutch brothers are a friendly, upbeat, and positive alternative to its rivals in the immediate area.the annilator  is smooth, rich, and a breath of fresh air when you need it most. the girls at the counter will gladly answer any questions you may have and will assist you in making the right choice.
be prepared to always wait long in the drive thru. they want to have full on conversations! aint nobody got time for that when youre on your way to work! have to come earlier i guess so i can just wait and wait.
great service with a smile,and good coffee toboot. p
huge coffees! the large seemed to be at least 32oz. i got a chai tea, it was pretty good. the service was great and the girl in the drive threw was a sweetheart.
the coffe here is not half bad all the cashier are a little too peppy but they all mean well there very nice
great new spot in plaza midwood! the beer and cocktails are excellent and there is a nice, large space for hanging at the bar. the food was tasty, but not crazyauthentic. the workmans friend will definitely be my afterwork drinks bar in the hood!
2nd time here and still loving the place. this evening the lights are a little low for my taste. but it beats the brightness the last time. food is a! the atmosphere is great for singles or parties. so glad to have this in the neighborhood.
nice addition to plaza midwood.  the lamb was spot on!!!!  people with me loved the fish and chips.  i am loving the diversity these guys bring.  place felt warm and inviting.  had a guinness, just seemed to taste better at this joint!!only rub for the wife not me not much for the vegetarian.
interior design, welcoming! came in with, no expectations and for the most part, delighted! food was fantastic, the sliders and quail egg, a smooth elegant balance. the side items are a bit small, but a tasty nibble! unfortunately , out of two of the signature drinks and 3 local taps; must have been a great opening!! definitely will be back!!
great new spot in plaza mid wood. my girlfriend and i ordered the okra the sausage roll and the fried oysters. the food was spot on and sauces that complemented each were delicious. the only bad thing i have to say about my experience was that the noise level was a little excessive. you literally had to yell at the table in order to hold a conversation. other than that it was great and i would recommend trying it to anyone. next time i think ill sit outside though.
try the summer salad.  watermelon chunks, kiwi, avocado...great on these hot summer nights.
ive been to the workmans friend twice now and i think its a lovely place.  i love what they have done with the interior. you can tell they spent a lot of time and money on making it look old yet refined.  the ambiance is casual and there is a lot of seating.  we went on a saturday at 7 and got a table right away which was awesome!its irish, so the food is heavy... but its also delightful.  the slider app is the best thing on the menu in my personal opinion.  a friend had the shepards pie and that looked like the best option.  the cocktail list is a little pricey, but very good.  i like their signature drink, the workmans friend, a lot!  but its a light pour and at 9each i have to switch to beer for any subsequent drinks.  the gin smash and bloody jimmy were delicious as well.next time were going to take advantage of that beautiful patio!for us this will definitely be a cocktail and appetizer goto!
close to 5 stars, but something was missing.  ill have to go back.  having red breast whiskey put them over the top and should have gotten that 5th star, but whats missing....?  service with a smile was great too.  also its nice to see something come to plaza midwood that is actually needed and not just a different version of something similar.i love the decor.  legit uk pub feeling.  supposedly the wallpaper is even copied from an old irish pub.  was surprised by the clientele.  there were quite a number of attractive young females for a pub.  i was there for a business meeting though, so no time to talk to any of those pretty ladies.nobody was willing to share their food, so i can only compliment the fish and chips.  great batter, super juicy and perfectly cooked cod, some buttery peas, and of course chipsfrench fries for those not in the know.  all great and that entree was only like 12 or 13 bucks.  not a bad deal for the neighborhood, although a lot of the entrees were more.  i would have gotten out cheap, but of course i had some whiskey on the rocks that cost that much as my dinner.  when the host of the table orders something as great as red breast you have to join him.ill be back to try other things.  the shepherds pie especially once it gets a little cooler out.
i had lunch recently here with friends and it was amazing!!!  i had a salad with seriously the freshest greens i have ever had.  i also had a side with beets that was equally fresh and delicious.  prices were very reasonable and parking is right behind the restaurant!    the bar taps look good  i would love to stop back in for a beer some time.  super unique dishes and really fun atmosphere.  very cozy and warm feeling.  will definitely be back.
i just got to check this place out and i was pleasantly surprised by their food quality. i heard this is the new hip spot, and frankly im not that hip  so i didnt know what to expect when my friends and i decided to have dinner  drinks on a saturday night. at 8pm, there was a short wait for table which you have to put your name on the list by finding the hostess  the station is in the middle of the restaurant, not by the door. its a good amount of crowd, not too empty but not too crowded. we were able to enjoy a drink by the bar. drinks, well, they arent cheap in my book min 57 for beer, min 6.50 for wine, 10 for signature cocktail, 7 for a well drink, but i suppose thats what everyone is charging nowadays. after a drink we were able to sit at a table toward the back. my friends ordered the mussels and bag of chips as starters. mussels tasted good but were a little overcooked. chips were fried perfectly. i had the fish  chips for dinner 12 and it was big enough to share. fish was fried golden crispy. it came with fries or chips and a bow of english peas. my friend had the chicken dish 19 and came with mac  cheese and fried asparagus. only complaint on her dish was that it came out a little cold. my other friend had the sliders and they looked adorable. and the 4th person had the poached pear salad and it tasted a good balance of sweet  tart.overall i was impressed by the food and service was solid. granted it was a little pricey a night out in my hood set up back about 42. note: the beer garden in the back is not finished yet  so right now its just an enclosed patio space which was nice.
i love this place. great atmosphere, great food if limited, great servers, and bartenders. the only problem is that in game day they should turn the music off, turn up the volume to the game, and bring in the customers with some specials! i dont know of any pub that doesnt play sports with the volume up!!
love the atmosphere at this place, its a great addition to the neighborhood!  the perfect spot to enjoy a drink and some apps with friends.the food is pretty solid dont expect to be blown out of the water by everything, but its all pretty good. thus far, ive tried the beets, the watermelon salad, the sliders, and ive heard that the shepherds pie is outstanding.
this edition of excited about eating takes us to the plazamidwood area of charlotte and to the workmans friend, an irish pub offering a variety of pub fare with a southern influence. dora here. plaza midwood came through for us again! originally, wed picked out a restaurant in downtown charlotte, but panther fans snagged all the onstreet parking. plaza midwood is a fabulous alternative to eating in downtown proper, and i appreciated the ample parking in the back of the workmans friend. :for an appetizer, we chose the bag of chips, hand cut fries with salt and malt vinegar aioli. not chips in the american sense, nor the typical thick and potatoy pub chips. they were almost a blend of the two, crispy on the outside and firm on the inside. i ate mine with extra malt vinegar. perfect!dora here. you should have seen ernies face when the server set the chips down on the table. i knew he expected homemade american chips. lol.the irish breakfast was the brunch special of the day. eggs, a banger sausage, black and white pudding also sausage, irish bacon, baked beans, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, and sourdough toast. black pudding is sausage made from blood, meat, fat, oatmeal, and bread or potato fillers. white pudding the same minus the blood, and irish bacon is from the back of the pig instead of the belly and is like ham. the highlights of this great dish were the three different types of sausage and the sourdough bread. dora here. im a big fan of irish pubs. well, pubs of all kinds, actually. id heard about black and white pudding but never tried it until now. see those two round patties next to the baked beans. and how did they ever come up with that name??. considering the ingredients and the name, i was surprised at how tasty they were.the sausage roll, a blend of ground sausage and mustard and sour cream inside a puff pastry, fit my mood. something light, not too heavy, and i enjoyed the mild sausage flavor. we rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ernie  dora hiers, fiction faith  foodies blog
the waitress recommended the fine thing, which was a prosecco with traces of lavender, honey, lemon. i suspected that it would be one of those cheap tasting sparkling wine, but it was fabulous! the brussels sprout was cheesy and good if you like cheese. a bit too salty, though. handmade fries were cut just right, thin but still has the right amount of potato meat. nothing special with the ketchup, garlic dip was worth double dip :
the workmans friend is a new hotspot in plazamidwood that seems to be packed every time i go in there. i mean, good luck getting a seat on the weekend. not that its a small place, they just draw that large of a crowd. the place is very celtic themed and has a very old and pleasant ambiance on the inside or for a date or dinner with friends. the outside pretty nice too, though the paint job on some of the benchs isnt the best. i had paint flakes rub off on my back there.they have some very interesting cocktails there and their signature workmans friend is a much try. also, while im at it, try the evalin its a watermelon jalapeno drink that is mad refreshing. beer? its a celtic bar, yes they have good beer.their food has great presentation, as it should for the price. there is only one veg dish, which is a vegetable curry and its really quite excellent. i tend to go here for the drinks though.
came in with a large sized group for a networking dinner and we were adequately seated in the long row of seats in the back. the service was pretty good even with the larger crowd and the nuances expected with people coming and going.the place was full but not overly crowded on a thursday evening and parking can be tough in this area with a small lot behind the restaurant and little street parking with the other retail  dining establishments nearby.the winner here is the atmosphere, decor and the food. the appetizers bag of chips and fried okra were 3 stars. however, the open faced turkey sandwich with greens was a winner for a simple dish. the turkey portion was great with the delicious micro greens on top, a good balance of protein and tasty veggies thats not the typical lettuce, spinach, or arugula. the only criticism is i wish there was more of the apple tomato chutney to counter the turkey portion.i plan to return with a normal sized dinner party next time!
what a pleasant addition to plaza midwood.  i think this may be my new favorite in the neighborhood.  after putting our name on a hour long wait list at soul, we found ourselves here last saturday night.  it is the antithesis of soul.  no wait, no pretensions and great service.we started with the meat and cheese plate.  it doesnt come with nearly enough toast points.  our waitress offered a french baguette but i do believe they are fresh baked as it was still in the oven and our meals materialized before the baguette.  i had the grilled cheese and tomatoe soup,  the soup was the only miss.  it wasnt nasty, but was too tomatoey and had a strange texture.  i prefer a sweeter tomatoe soup.  this was boardering on spaghetti sauce.  my dining companions had the beet and goat cheese stack and the lamb.  they all raved.  workmans friend....nicely done.
very cozy space. it was a saturday when i went in, and very crowded, however, i didnt wait long. the drinks are sooooo expensive for a small size, but so unique and tasty. i probably wouldnt drink there again due to the cost. the food was great. i liked the grilled cheese and tomato soup. i am excited to try more things.
best bloody mary , the workmans friend were amazing cocktails! waiting for our food which sounds like its gonna b great. the fried oyster starter if any indication of the food promises to be awesome !!!!!
cute little place to have frozen yogurt with fruits or boba milk teas... they also have a wide variety of smoothies and green teas... service is quick and place is very colorful and neat. i ordered mango smoothie with boba and it was delicious.. they also have gluten free and non fat smoothies...
we ate from new wrap order when they were parked at noda. i was pretty impressed with their offerings! the asian style wanchos were the clear favorite and should be a must order when ever you find yourself near this food truck. i also had a delicious caribbean wrap... i loved the crunchy bits of plantains and the jamaican jerk sauce! my boyfriend got the traditional wrap. i had a taste and wasnt that impressed with his selection. compared to the bold flavors in the wanchos and my wrap, it just kinda fell flat.
arghhhhhhh. i mostly try to stay away from red meat but this place is a definite treat yoself spot when it comes to meat. bacon wrapped filet mignon. lamb chops. flank steak. pork loin. minus 1 star for them not having prime rib when i was there!!!!! and all come to you table over and over and over again like a vicious delicious juicy cycle. then theres the salad bar. omg. i love salad. so much. u dont even know! i was considering just the salad bar for dinner but, they told me they would have prime rib lies! as a meat choice. anyways, back to the salad bar. cheese. cheesy bread. mash potatoes. sweet bananas  those bananas changed my life!!!!!!!!!!!!! i could, literally, eat just the sweet bananas with rice and salt. how filipino am i right!!? lol
i came out to vegas in january 15 and was told this was the last meal we would go to less i want to end up in a food coma prior to hitting all the activities. it did not disappoint. servers with endless cuts of savory meats, all indicated with the flip of a small chip on your table: green means go and red means ive had enough. not to mention you can fill up on the salad bar alone, if youre not carnivorous try the red quinoa salad. safe to say, come here with an appetite and plan for a nap afterwards.
i love brazilian steakhouses and this is the spot i go when we have special occasions or a coupon because its always decent and you can eat tons of meat. lamb chops are the best and i also enjoy their picanha.
i love texas de brazil. for one, you know exactly what youre going to get. high quality, flavorful, delicious food. i have been to tdb in the past but this was my first time at this location. the food was equally great, upkeep of the premises, and prices. my server was not as attentive as i am used to so thats why theres a missing star. anyways, if youre even thinking of a churrascaria, look no further! this tdb will not disappoint!!
excellent restaurant.  the price is high but all you can eat meat, which is excellent is worth it.  the service was wonderful and the facility itself was impeccable.  it is well worth stopping here for a meal if you are in vegas.
im on a lowcarb diet, so this place seemed like a good idea. i tried the pichana, chicken wrapped in bacon, and parmesan pork loin. all very good. and the pricing is pretty decent. worth checking out.
i love me some good brazilian bbq.  this place is pretty comparable to fogo de chao, and a smidge cheaper.  the service is great.  once we got our plates from the buffet portion, we pretty much got 45 types of meats on our plates within 5 minutes.  the waitress said they had kinds of meat, but i dont think we got that many.  i find that the quality of meat is not as good as fogo, but it was still pretty good.  the filet mignon was super tender.their buffet section had a lot of options.   the lobster bisque was pretty good as was the smoked salmon.  this place is definitely worth trying out if you want something thats not a typical vegas buffet.on a side note, the soda is not free refills.  you just get a small bottle.
words of advice, dont pile up on the salad bar thinking you need to get your monies worth or else youll regret the reason youre there for, the all you can eat steaks!even at 50 a pop per head, this place just rocks with the cool ambience and brazilian theme music playing. you have to request the house picana sirloin and beef rib served on a silver platter for sure and often. everything on the menu for me is tasty and prepared to your likings rare to well done, and dont be afraid to let the waiters know, and your meal and experience will be well worth the price! the desserts especially the chocolate layer mouse cake is very good also. make sure you take the time to make a reservation because this place will get packed really fast! i recommend this restaurant if you like meat, and lots of it because it keeps coming, and coming etc.
every time were in vegas, we visit texas de brazil. this means in the last three years, ive been here at least 6 times.each visit has been excellent. we are always served by very courteous and friendly waiters. the meats are cooked to our liking and come around often. if theres a particular cut or meat we want, the server is quick to get the meat dude to us.salad bar area is fully stocked with delicious offerings. i have learned to not eat it all because you will not have room for the meats! the grape salad is so delicious. i always save room for that. onion ceviche is a must when eating the rich meats.chimichurri is really good. i rarely eat the mashed potatoes, but when i do, man. buttery fat inducing goodness. the lil cheese breads are as good as any other place ive been to. i wish i had more room in my stomach to hold them all.i look forward to coming to the restaurant each time. i dare say i am a bit of an addict.highly recommended to my friends and definitely think you should check this place out if youre into churrascaria!
im a fan of the food not a fan of the price!  honestly, i could never eat 50 plus dollars of a meal!! what i do like about restaurants like this one is the options.  im a picker.  i like to pick at different things but picking is costly! haha.side dishes are good and i liked the selection.  much better than fogo where its mostly just a salad bar. my friends and i had dinner here this past saturday night while in vegas celebrating my birthday.  12 of us.  service was good, ambiance was nice, food was good.  ive been to many brazilian places and this is one of my better experience.  would i come here again? sure, if i want to blow 100 bucks.
really good food and be ready to stuff yourself. first the salad bar is great plus all the bread, potatoes, and sugar coated bananas. but this is a trick to make you fill up on the small stuff. you need to save room for the meat. they have a great variety of meats, all very salty but tasty. the service was good but the place is packed and very loud. not a great place for a first date or a business meeting. but great if you want to stuff your face with some friends. the 50 a person is a bit pricey especially since that does not include a drink or desert.  but it is still worth it. definitely will come back.
quality. service. taste. and did i mention all the food you can stomach?? everything about our experience at texas de brazil was aces except the tableroom i reserved. let me explain...we were gonna be in town for several days for a bachelor party and i had called to reserve a table for 10. i signed up for their online newsletter and it alerted me to them having private rooms available. i inquired about that and natasha said we could have that room for our party as it was not reserved yet. i called about 2 months prior to our weekend in vegas. i even asked natasha if the room would be able to handle a couple of more people as our party number might fluctuate closer to the date. she assured me that the room is spacious enough to hold up to 50 and it was all ours. awesome! well, the weekend came around and on the day of our dinner reservation i got a call to confirm. i called back and did so. no word of any issues, so i didnt worry... problem was when i got there, i was told by the hostess and later by the manager that the private room wasnt available as it had been booked already but natasha wasnt aware. hmmm... really?? now you tell me?... sounds fishy. sounds like you booked a bigger party in that room and bumped us. i wasnt told that but im not a fool. all they needed to do was ask me and i wouldve given up that room to the bigger party. no problem. instead i was given a lame excuse that i wasnt buying. a nice establishment like this, and they dont have all their reservations synched?? cmon now! anyways, that was not cool... and i had to tell the story. the manager was apologetic and promised to give us a table kind of off to the side and we kinda did. it was whatever by then...we were hungry and we were seated.the food was great. all the cuts of meat we had were delicious. the various cuts of beef, chicken  pork were great. i really liked the bacon wrapped filet.the brazilian sausage was delish. pork ribs i missed out on but i heard they were great. bacon wrapped chicken was also good. parmesan crusted pork loin was tasty. flank steak was delicious.the herbmarinated pork loin was also good. meat wasted for sure. the salad and sides bar was good. i liked the charcuterie. the prosciutto was good with bread and cheese. the string beans and garlic mash was great. but the true star was the lobster bisque. i had heard about this greatness for a while and it lived up to the hype. so good. you will want to have bowl and bowls of it. yumm.service was attentive. they were always around offering us the different cuts of beef, clearing our dishes and refilling our drinks. the only issue was with our reservation. had to deduct a star for that. i considered deducting more but the experience otherwise was great. like i said, i signed up for their online newsletter and timing was with us as i got an email giving parties of up to 10 to be given 10 off each person making it 40 instead of 50 for dinner. monthurs. cool beans. we were there on a thursday night so it was perfect. i suggest signing up. i plan on eating there again the next time were in town. i will make reservations again. i hope that aspect is far improved on the next trip. lobster bisque!!
husband and i dined here with the kids. not bad, but not sure if id go back again. the food was good, just felt like i had to wait a while for my meat to be well done. they only served rare or medium rare meat. the service was phenomenal.  i enjoyed the filet and the filet with bacon. it was a great experience, but hubby and i agreed we wouldnt go back again.  not sure if its worth going back for the two filets i enjoyed.
i really enjoy the food and the evening dinning. the one thing i think a lot of people miss is that when you are being presented so many options that the conversation in our groups has always been very lively. the meats speak for themselves. now you should have a bowl of lobster bisk and a pitcher of sangria.
went to texas de brazil for dinner this past saturday night 1010th  9:30pm for a fantastic 2 hour dinner. really late to be feasting as a carnivore so late at night, but the only other available reservation time was at 7pm. given the fact i made the phone call at 6:56pm, those 4 minutes was kinda untimely; so we ate late into the night.this brazilian steakhouse was half filled with patrons when we arrived. immediately greeted by a very friendly hostess, who sat us at a nice table for 2, staged among a classy and romantic ambiance; close to the salad bar.the lobster bisque was outstanding! plenty of gourmet cold and hot salad bar food selections to savor.our server hanna, from rio, was excellent! she coordinated with a few other servers offering us plenty of mouth watering tasty brazilian meat selections, all hand carved tableside, with impeccable service. our bottle of fine red wine was delicious  intoxicating, yet overpriced; but what fine dining restaurant doesnt mark it up 300?! surprised we were offered desserts considering we were the last couple in the restaurant and everybody probably wanted to go home. but we agreed we were stuffed with no room for dessert! however, the dessert selection our server hanna presented to us at our table looked absolutely amazing.overall, texas de brazil was an outstanding fine dining experience that i would gladly return to; at an earlier dinner hour. reservations recommended in advance. no pictures taken. go see for yourself :yelp 250 challenge 2015: 232
celebrating my 41st birthday!!!  mouthwatering all u can eat meat however they mostly served medium  i prefer my meat in a well done side, dont want bloody juice in my steak. salad is phenomenal, lobster bisque sooo good  u dipped in warm moist cheese bread bites.
texas de brazil is a delicious meat extravaganza. but, beyond meat, they have a wonderful saladantipastohot foods bar! everything in the bar is super fresh and high quality! definitely try the bacon from the bar as well as the artichokes and manchego cheese. if you want a yummy bar combination, wrap some of the creamy goat cheese with a thin salty slice of prosciutto. excellent service and selection!
i went to texas de brazil for a bachelor party, so we made a reservation. i tried to change my reservation later, but they didnt have any spots available. this place is popular so make sure you make a reservation, especially on the weekends. this is probably one of my best experiences with meat in vegas.there was so much meat that i forgot all the types that i tried. my favorites were in order:1 picanha2 ribs very soft, fall offthebone goodness3 filet mignon4 sausagethe salad bar was very extensive. they all sorts of veggies, smoked salmon, cured meats, cheese, and too many other items for me to remember.service: our server was attentive in the beginning, but was nowhere to be found throughout the night. there were plenty of servers around, so we just asked them for whatever we needed.
we had reservations at 7:45pm.. heres 8:01pm and we are still waiting to be seated. whats the point on making a reservation when you have to wait to be called while the whole time i see people that came in after us and have been seated before us. disappointing. this is why we like to go to via brasil better. we only came here because we have friends in town from reno. way to go on putting on a first impression. customer service is not the greatest at the front. i will update after dinner with service.i give the waiter and people who come around with the meats a solid 5 stars but the hostess a 1... theyre just terrible with keeping their reservations.
gets better every time! the service is always so genuine and we are always impressed! i highly recommend trying the top sirloin, the garlic filet, and the lamb chop with the mint jelly. my only reason for not giving a 5 star is the hostesses could be more engaging upon arrival and when exiting....we will be back!
great! service was great! food was great! but 4 stars because the carpet in the front was pretty dirty which made me double think about the place since the front carpet was the first thing i saw. but it was worth it. just remove or wash the front carpet and it would be great!
this place is amazing. the meat is delicious and perfectly seasoned. the salad bar is huge and the sides are good, too. try to save room for dessert because it is worth it! i had the bellini and it was very good as well. the decor is beautiful. the only bad thing was one of the guys dropped a cut of steak on my pants as he was putting it on my plate and he didnt really seem to care. it ended up staining those pants. the food is worth it and we will return!
the food was great and very fresh.lamb was awesome amd my favorite.the cinnamon sugar bananas outstanding.the staff all were very friendly and informative.the lobster bisque was nasty.i made a reservation and highly recommend this we still waited 5 to 10 min but not an issue at all.sign up on the website for coupons.the bread with the cheese they give you is awesome
ive been so keen to try this place as everyone has been raving about it, and i would say it is good!this was my first time at any churrasco place, so it was definitely different than what im used to when it comes to ayce. servers go around with different meat that you can try, which is pretty cool. but if theres a certain meat you really like  want more of, you have to wait til they come back around to your table.meats were good  tasty. some were too salty for my taste, but everything was really good. theres a buffet table with sides, salads, veggies, soups, etc. that you can go up to as frequently as you like. their lobster bisque was really good.one major downside is that dessert isnt included in the price! youd think after paying 50person for dinner would include dessert, unfortunately, thats not the case its obviously not a restaurant id go to frequently due to their price  amount of food one could consume, but its definitely a good place to go to for special occasions.word of advice:  dont eat too much sides as youd want to get your moneys worth on the meat. eat each meat as you get them. if you wait which sometimes takes them a while to get to your table, the quicker youll get full.
sunday mornings are a great time to try new coffee shops! its a very cute cozy coffee shop!  i felt very comfortable. i had a very delicious and pretty mocha! that was sooo frothy and rich! ill be back. there was a glitch with getting my meat pie, but the owner took care of it quickly! thank you. .i predict great success for this cute coffee shop!
first time here ..... awesome atmosphere and really really good coffee!! love this place and will definitely come back ..... hope they add some more breakfast items to the menu! .... if u love coffee you must check out this place !!
tasty coffee and paninis. comfortable atmosphere and seating. friendly and knowledgeable staff. could turn the music down a bit, but not overbearing. only complaint is it is a bit overpriced. all in all, i hope this place stays around for awhile.
the chai lattes here are amazing  spicy but smooth. a little expensive 3.75 for a small cup but id gladly pay that to support local small businesses. the atmosphere is great too, quiet but not eerily so. its out of my way to get here from tempe but id make the trip again.
the coffee is 5 stars. 4 stars for the food. the iced coffee and lattes are exceptional and the ritual beans they use are amazing. the pop tarts are excellent. had an ok coffee cake another morning and the breakfast souffles were ok, but lacking in flavor and a bit dry. free wifi and comfortable seating. staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.
first time visitor, long time coffee drinker. the interior decor is comfortably welcoming. the noise level from customers and machines is the typical coffee house din. they turned the music down to a gentle roar after about 15 minutes of sitting down. did they read my mind? the barista was excellent. he knew about all the different brewing methods they had including some id never tried like v60 and chemist brewing. ill have to try that the next time. i had my usual, mocha latte with almond milk. the cup came with exceptional coffee foam art on the top. the brew was smooth, not bitter and very drinkable, yet unremarkable. not a lot of body from the bean. my blueberry muffin was bone dry. i should have known by the dark brown exterior that it was overbaked. ill definitely be back to try the espresso, chia seed energy smoothie. free wifi, supercomfy lounge seating, a community table if thats how you roll. plenty of space to work on a laptop. if youre serious about coffee, give this place a try. ill be back.
very cute coffee shop in the middle of north scottsdale. lots of seating and tables for individual and group studyingcatch up session. i saw a conference room in the back but it was reserved by some high school dance team when i was there. the cold brew was not exactly to my taste but still refreshing, the service very friendly and apparently on fridays during happy hour 37pm, you can gamble for a free cup of coffee by playing rock,paper,scissors with the barista. definitely wished it was a friday when i found that out :p
just traveling thru, an awesome atmosphere! the internet was fast. the cold coffee was a little watery for me but im used to french press intensity. my sister got an iced chai tea and they said they dont do blended which is confusing when they have smoothies. we each had a panini, they were nice and a fair portion for the quality and price. toasted but not stiff as a board, flavorful but not drenched in sauce. i got the vegetarian one with goat cheese and avocado. service was polite and efficient.
i had the roasted veggies wgoats cheese panini. it was great!
weve been into maverick a few times, and i definitely dig it.id never think a cutecomfortable coffee shop where id actually want to hang out a while would be in this plaza, but maverick proved me wrong! were usually grab and go coffee drinkers, but both visits weve hung out and relaxed while we finished our drinks. there are a few hightop tables, a long, larger table for bigger groups in the middle of the room, a few nooks of comfy couches and chairs for a couple, and a semiprivate room in the back. really, you can come here with almost any amount of people and find a place to hang! the decor is neat, and whatever the contraption hanging from the ceiling making drip coffee im sure im screwing up this terminology terribly is, its awesome!both visits we nabbed iced coffees, and once we shared a pastry as well. all delish! i do think its a tad on the pricey side to swoop in for a coffee, but i know that comes with the territory for an independent shop. employees weve encountered have ranged from incredibly friendly to meh, which, again, comes with the territory.all in all, its a fine place for a caffeine fix!
great tasting coffee if you like your coffee luke warm. we ordered a chai and a mocha and both were served to us just warm. i ask why it wasnt hot and the barista said he made it as hot as possible. somehow i find that hard to believe. he said he would make the drinks again but i figured why if he already said he made them as hot as he could. its to bad because our drinks were really tasty just not hot enough. i think they need to get your espresso machine serviced.thank you mitch for your response and kind offer.  next time we are in town we will definitely stop by. wishing you continued success!
we had not been here before but it is convenient to shea 14 where we planned to see a movie. it is not a full service restaurant: you walk up to a counter where an employee explains the menu including food and beverages. it does take plastic.  nonalcoholic drinks are self serve.  beer and wine are available.  when your food is ready, it is delivered.  my wife got the fish tacos and declared them 5 star. i got coconut shrimp as a meal and thought they were three star, very greasy and low flavor. it included fries and rice. a friend got baked fish on rice and was happy enough.  service was adequate for meal delivery and dish pickup so i tipped about 11.
cute place to grab a quick bite. fish tacos were a bit dry and didnt really like the breading on the fish n chips, could be better if it was tempura.  fish is very mild, no fishy taste.
went with some neighbors the 2nd day it is open  they are still doing some set up they were building chairs while we were there. on the plus side, we got to meet the owners a couple who are also opening up the lodge on a cross corner from this place which is in the tempe culinary dropoutyard complex, which is set to open july 1st and the wife is a hoot, it was so fun talking with here!as for the space, wonderfully open with high ceilings and just a nice clean look. the wife told us that all the wait staff and cooks had already worked for several months at the arcadia location so you can expect a smooth opening. for us, the coffee was great and they refilled it on a regular basis and the food came out quickly, which is always nice but that may slow down a bit as this place packs up, but maybe not. i had the waffle and fried chicken which is a flattened breast cutlet, which i thought was good, though i tend to like a thicker waffle this one is pretty thin, though good. i would also say the price point is pretty good  my dish, with an additional egg and coffee was a bit over 13 with tax not including tip. overall, good food, service is also good and nice location full disclosure, i can walk to it, which i love, ill definitely be back again.
grand opening today. waited in line for the 6:30am opening and it was worth it. i got the breakfast sandwich with scrambled eggs, ham, and goat cheese which was delicious. will definitely be returning to try other items on the menu.
this place was great, decent variety. i got the blue berry pancakes. appeared to be typical pancakes, but i dug into thick, yet fluffy cakes filled with delicious blueberries! yum! the owner even came around to check on us. would definitely return!
just discovered earlier in the week that over easy had opened a location on farmer in the yard, in a former industrial part of tempe. theres interesting things going on here, so i thought id give this breakfast place a try, and have been there twice.on my first go round, midweek, the place was virtually empty, so i took a seat at a table and ordered their chilaquiles with an overmedium egg. was definitely tasty, though after about 12 of the plate was gone, it began losing its appeal, mainly because the flavors ended up being fairly single note. id say spice it up a bit: add additional sides of pico de gallo, a bit more sour cream, and hell, why not make the chilaquiles in the form of a casserole and serve that way, rather than a plate of tortilla triangles which have been sauced with ranchero and covered with melted cheese.  the casserole style might give you more options, and allow you to add an additional side item to your menu.today, the place was packed, so i sat by myself at the counter.  it took a while for the wait person to get to me after bringing me coffee and water. not sure why it took them so long to tally up other customers bills and process these customers credit cards, but it was a bit too long between bringing the coffee and taking my food order. this time, went basic with their two egg breakfast, which im sure i pointed to on the menu, but the hash browns never came out, so i had to point out the menu mentioned hash browns, and these came really quickly after i said something.  the only suggestion i have is to cook your toast to order, mine came out really dry and somewhat hard, like it had been cooked ahead in anticipation of whole wheat toast being ordered.coffee both days was really, really good. first day i got several pours, and offered a cup to go. today, only offered one pour, and i felt a little like the single diner the restaurant didnt want to pay attention to. other than this little service wrinkle, i welcome this place to the list of possible breakfast places.
went here for breakfast with my daughter this morning.  i had been to the one in gilbert several times and liked it.  the restaurant itself is cute.  we just walked in and sat down and were waited on quickly. we got the over easy iced coffee, which is flavored with cinnamon, cardamom and mint, and it was delicious, and you get a large glass of it, which is a definite plus.  i ordered the malted waffle, which was good, and my daughter ordered the brioche french toast, which was tasty, but the portion was quite small for the price, in my opinion.  we also got hash browns and bacon, which was good.  i prefer the caramelized banana french toast they have, but our meal was tasty, too.  ill probably go there again.  breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out.
first time at this location and it was just as good as all the rest. great selection of yummy breakfast treats. the yard has a parking situation, so be forewarned  its crowded!! ride your bike over or walk and youll be happy enough. the food is so so good. think light and fluffy pancakes, sweet pumpkin bread french toast, and flavorful loco moco. service is stellar and the selection of morning beverages is perfect. loved it.
nice place for some latin music , they play everything . 25 bucket for six beers party starts happening around 11:00 pm to 11:30 pm . lots of tables and chairs to sit on . this is the place to go on a sunday night .
delicious.... authentic italien, even though i am not, but it feels like it. wait staff is attentive, and prices are reasonable.
my husband and i just had a wonderful relaxing time here. the message was just right and my back feels great. at 35 an hour i will definitely be back. would have given five stars but for some reason in the middle of message they turned the music down and you could hear everything from morenos next door.
a surprising treasure close to home. i have had two massages here within a short time. both times i walked out relaxed and refreshed. the staff is professional and courteous. reflexology is a phenomenal alternative to traditional massages, and considering there is no membership needed even for short notice appointments this is the place to go! this will be my to go to business from now on.
my parents and i went on friday and had a terrific experience. we asked for one hour of reflexology, and received a fantastic service. very relaxing, and we all felt great leaving.when you arrive they will have you answer a few brief questions regarding where youd like them to focus and how much pressure youd like. then they lead you back to a bed. this location does not have curtains or separation between the beds my dad did not like that, but once they get started i dont find that it matters much. you can pay 20 more for a private room with hot stones. this is a full body massage for 40. remember to tip generously if you enjoyed your service! i used to work reception at a reflexology place and i know they get much less than 40 for each customer.reason for the loss of star is 1 they didnt answer their phone. on yelp it said they opened at 9am, and i must have called at least a dozen times between 850 and 11am. finally we just got in the car and went over there. they were in fact open, and we were able to get right in. 2 the location, right next to the restaurant, isnt great. you can, from time to time, hear whats going on over there, which isnt relaxing. with that being said it was minimal and probably non existent if you went in the morning.
i really like the trainers here and the workout but there are a few negatives:1. they dont tell you when you sign up that you need to also purchase the heart rate monitor2. they say theres no membership fee but with the 30 day cancellation policy you are stuck with renewing monthly3. i have been there three weeks and multiple machines are broken. the place is like 2 months old there should be nothing broken. now the pa system is broken and you cant hear the trainer.4. the battery life on the heart rate monitor was 4 classes!!!! 4!!!!! are you kidding me? it cost 50 please work longer than that!!5. the trainers have friends in the class or favorites and they offer encouragement to them but i dont see them trying to get to know anyone else.6. the location.... its an area that is in the process of being cleaned up. after a class there was a lot of police activity and it was really uncomfortable walking to my car alone.7. no parking lot....the positives:1. its amazing workout.2. it is never ever the same! which is amazing3. the one trainer reminds me of chalene johnson who i love!!!4. the music is great!!!5. the treadmills have fans!!!!! which is amazing!!!!!its an amazing concept with some kinks... fix the machines please there is no excuse for broken when we pay 100 a month.
im so happy this is here! yippee! good bubble tea in edinburgh!having travelled around asia and australia, im familiar with the chatime brand; its ubiquitous. its everywhere. its pretty damn delicious. and now we have one smack bang in the middle of central edinburgh!the menu is huge guys  be prepared to be overwhelmed. its first broken down into milk teas, fruit teas, non milk teas, tea lattes etc. then you have the option of choosing either hot or iced, and your size of choice. add any extra toppings such as boba, red bean !!!!, grass jelly or other delicious things for an extra 50p!the best part of this for me is that they havent westernised the menu in any way; everything present in the asian stores is here, including taro milk, matcha milk tea, red bean and coconut jelly. whats more, they also kept the option to let you customise your sweetness level  something that most other bubble tea stores in the uk dont offer. madness! thank you for keeping this chatime!not quite 5 stars because, alas, this place aint cheap. i had a delicious regular iced milk tea with red bean, only slightly sweetened, and it came to £3.50. it was a generous portion, but i reckon this will be an occasional treat rather than a daily bank balance crippling indulgence!
chatime is going to become a its really too expensive but im going to get bubble tea there anyway treat.as other yelpers have said there is a wide choice of bubbles, tea, sweetness and queue size i think my long queue size maybe had something to do with the fringe being on  pats chinwarning the large is large, and if i was not so greedy would be deemed sharing sizedownsides, i got charged 7p for sugar?! next time i will just cary it home and use my own sweet sweet free sugar.oh and cash only!it most definitely had something to do with it.
every time i passed by here, this will reminds me of hometown. i was always disappointed that after every tiring and exhausted shopping for a whole day or half day, i cant find a place to have some milk tea, which was a thing i always do when i was in shanghai. the only drink you would be able to find are coffee or cold drink...so i was absolutely very happy to spot this small but lovely shop on my way home!i can tell the taste was almost as same as i had before when i was in china. youll be allowed to choose how much sugar and ice youd like. for me, standard sugar was a bit sweet, so perhaps less sugar 75 sweet would be better. hot milk tea is 25p more expensive, but totally worth it for winter.the price was absolutely too expensive, considering i had milk tea with tapioca pearl for only 5060p back in shanghai. but honestly i cant ask for more here  considering all the ingredients might be imported. 34 pounds for milk tea and tapioca is fair enough.
this is the most recent mountainside fitness to open. it is very clean and the cycle room is amazing!
im a gym hopper i get sick of gyms easily. i see myself staying here for awhile. its brand new, and so is the equipment. the basketball court is rather tiny so it really is only good for 1 or 2 people to shoot around. i have never done any of classes but they seem to be always full. the lockers rooms are clean but the tanning machine i do not think has been cleaned yet. the brand new gym still has the novelty of being brand new so its busy all the time. the free weights section is always busy, lots of people love to look at themselves so its a popular spot. there are a certain level of meatheads but thats to be expected, there are also skinny dudes who wear tank tops and look silly but all in all its a nice gym with great equipment. you can watch people pretend to work out, the type that do a set play on their phone do another set dont put back their weights. gym etiquette is not really observed here many treat it like its someone elses job to put their weights away. im still trying to find that slow time to go and not deal with the crowd but so far havent found it. the female staff seems to wear pounds of make up and since they all look the same i have to assume this a poor decision enforced by management.
had breakfast here. this is what replaced central at caesars palace, and is located just around the corner from the hotel lobby. service was good and prompt. they have good coffee and a good juice selection, though its a pricey juice at 7 for a small glass. had a crab cake eggs benedict. overall, the dish was good. english muffin perfectly toasted, eggs perfectly poached, and hollandaise sauce was great. however, the crab cakes couldve used a little more crab and a little less bread so i was a little underwhelmed having previously lived in maryland where theres a very high standard for crab cakes. the meal came with breakfast potatoes, which were good. overall, this is a great place to come for breakfast.
this is a great spot to grab a bite to eat after a long night of entertainment on the las vegas strip or if your flying in on a red eye. its open 24 hours a day, and they offer quality breakfast, lunch, and dinner options at any hour. youll definitely find something to fit any craving at this place. the service was great, and my eggs, potatoes, and bacon came out perfectly.  they also have a full service bar located at the front of the restaurant, right across from the hotel checkin. theres no better way to start your vegas adventure than with a drink in your hand!
so we ended up here right before a concert when we were starved and had minimum time to eat. the place was pretty empty around 7p and the prices seemed a tad high for a cafe but we didnt have much of a choice. we got 2 pasta dishes, the prosciutto pizza and the pork belly nachos for 4 people.  the pizza flavors were so good  i only wish there was more prosciutto.  the pasta was perfectly cooked and the pork belly nachos....omg i wish i had saved much much more room for those...they were so good. the drinks were also very good, although i think a bit light on the alcohol... overall, a solid choice for dinner  the ambiance is really nice despite the fact that its called a cafe, the food portions were solid but not overwhelming and the food itself was great.
above average coffee shop. if your here for breakfast bring an appetite. neither of us could finish the scrambled eggs with meat and potatoes. seating was no problem mid week. the service was quick and efficient. although its probably more than you would expect to pay for breakfast you dont do it that often. the restaurant is one of two with full service and we like to have one great breakfast during our stay and it should hold us until dinner.
perfect spot for a simple drink, a big meal and peoplewatching especially at the bar area facing the caesars lobby.  and also perfect for escaping the desert heat!  im here for a convention, and its a saturday, so its very crowded. fortunately this place is right by the hotel entryway. when i return to vegas, ill definitely come back here.
good food presentation. i like my blood mary a little spicer than they have offered but overall it was good.
stopped by cafe americano for a breakfast after early arrival to las vegas. cafe americano located right by the main entrance to caesars palace casino and it is open 24 hours. the menu is reasonably concise and makes selection easy. i had traditional eggs benedict, which was served with the potato hash. hash was perfectly crispy and very well seasoned this is not always the case im sure you can relate to that. the eggs were just a touch overlooked, and would wish for hollandaise sauce pour to be a bit more generous, but overall it was quite tasty dish im somewhat nit picking here. what i have a problem with is prices  i know it is las vegas, but 22 for eggs benedict is steep i guess i can live with 5 coffee as it comes with refills. interestingly enough, pasta dish on dinner menu costs 25  hard to figure out pricing strategy. well, during the late night, this might be your only option anyway...
this is one of the main 24 hour dining establishments at caesars palace. i had the pleasure of dining there twice, once for lunch and once for breakfast. both of my meals were totally delicious. for lunch i had a reuben sandwich with homemade chips. the reuben was more than i could handle. it was huge, just like most of the over the top entrees served in las vegas. for breakfast i had eggs benedict which were also very delicious. service each time was great and never rushed.
has a good experience here. i was tired from traveling and didnt want to expend too much brain power figuring out what to eat so i just went to the lobby and found this place. amazing service! water glass always full, perfect pacing, polite and efficient. manager stopped by to ask how it was going i always love that!!. i had the all american breakfast and all was delicious and cooked perfectly. my guest has the wedge salad and that was superb was well. loved the presentation. no issues and a good spot for a wide variety of options.
the margerita  pizza was good. the bartenders are good looking, charming, and entertaining. overall we had an interesting night. this was definitely better than going to some food court.
great spot for breakfast  they have a couple of all day breakfast items just in case you slept in. enjoyed the fresh avocado and bacon add on with my eggs that were cooked perfectly. tip: ask for your coffee to go when leaving and enjoy your cup while walking to your next destination.
great breakfast menu, has something for everyone.  good quality food open 24 hours, nice to have a decent sit down option for food all hours.
24 hour restaurant located at caesars palace. we went there for breakfast and liked the various choices available. took a bit longer than we expected so i dropped my rating to 4 stars but the service was friendly and the food was very good once it was served.
love the cryosauna, look for great pain relief and increased energy as well as a boost for metabolism. looking forward to trying the cryofacial! just wish they were open sundays!
you know somethings right when the owner of a competing club is drinking there :datmosphere: pub lord william henceforth known as plw is a new pub by the principals that brought the ye old orchard pubs to montreal.  having just recently opened  2 months of so come end of july 2015   the place has an industrial shop floor  pub feel to it.  not to say that its bad  not at all  its just that its so spacious! clean, proper, well set up  this place is here to do business and keep the ever growing young professionals population of griffen town well fed and liquored upservice: top marks here for sure  the owners definitely know what theyre doing and how to run a place like this.  the staff is culled from their other locations or recruited based on experienced  you wont get bad service here or have someone lose or mishandle your order.  waitresses are very very professional and very friendly  making conversation  recommendations and just being all around good to the bone.food:  err, youre here to drink!  unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it due to a quirk in the liquor licence plw has, you must order food with your drinks.  dont look for anything super special  pub food after all  but its done well and its cheep.  hotdogs  fries for a few dollars, nachos etc. its good stuff to snack on but oh so bad for that south beach diet... :pls is not exactly located on a well trodden path  but if youre a local or just happen to be in the area you should definitely make this a destination .
pretty cool new pub with a beautiful patio.  decent choice of drinks and bloody caesars that are not bad at all, i went for the big willy that comes with a candied bacon. the bacon was so good that i had to order a second caesar. the food menu has some good things to offer. poutine is just ok, although one of my friends was really happy with the french fries and the gravy was nice, the cheese curds really melted and i strongly believe they should be crunchy. my seasonal salad was beatiful, made with red, yellow and brown tomatoes, which were so tasty as they have been just picked from the garden. you gotta try the home made chips, the perfect snack for your bloody caesar!the pub inside is spacious, kind of industrial set up, but it feels comfy. we had a blast in the bathrooms, they all have black board walls and little bucket full of chalk pieces. the walls invite you to write something and we, the well grown kids, wrote for the first time in our life on the walls of a bathroom. now i have to come back to take a picture of the bloody caesar, as i forgot to do it yesterday and may be make another statement on the walls.......
very nice casual resto. been here for brunch and early dinner and there are enjoyable items on both menus. prefer afternoonevening menu. highlights are: nachos both options, lamb burger, crab benedict, and bloody caesar. avoid: their version of a cheese steak.the staff ive interacted w are super nice. place has a cool vibe. have not been during peak hours though.remark: not a bar! you must order food.
nice, new place for dim sum, available all day. white tablecloths, attentive service, fresh food and lots of varieties of dim sum that you dont always see in other places. ac cranking is a great thing in 110 degree heat, too.
we tried this place as it was so close to home. we went here for lunch for dim sum and was not disappointed. its same as other places around and not crowded at all like the one at the goldcoast.
good!! service is great!！will come here next time!  good sweet tofu and baked pianapple custard bun.
this restaurant is located on decatur across from the international market. they have dim sum all day and you can order from the menu. we ordered pork shumai and custard bun, they were very moist and delicious, one of the best i have had. we also ordered chicken feet and roast duck. roast duck was different texture and the way it was prepared, the skin was very crispy and there was no fat on the duck. it was amazingly good. we also ordered 3 other dim sum dishes but apparently the waiter has forgotten to put in those order. the waiter did not come back to ask if everything was good. we waited for 20 mins and i had to walk to the cashier and had to cancel the order since the server forgot.the service was not good. i would give it 3 stars but the food was delicious so i am giving it 4 stars.the price is average compared to other dim sum places.
ive been to almost all dim sum places here in lv so far this is the best! all dim sums were tasty and fresh. this place will be my regular dim sum place
food probably is 3.5 stars. but the ownersstaff are so very sweet and accommodating that they deserve 4 stars. every state that i have ever lived in my husband and i have tried every ethiopian establishment possible so were pretty familiar with the tastes and flavors of ethiopian food. considering that experience, some of the items on the menu were disappointing. i normally get the veggie combo and my husband gets doro wat. the dishes in veggie combo were just ok flavor wise. initially when they brought me my platter, every dish was cold, so i had to have it sent back. it took them nearly 1520 minutes to bring me back my platter, apparently they were preparing me a brand new platter. i appreciated the effort and consideration but it took way too long, by that time my husband was already done eating his plate. when they brought my dish back it was missing one of the dishes that the platter comes with; disappointing. also some of the chick pea dishes and the lentil dishes were super dry not what im used to. my husband was a little unhappy with his doro wat, he felt it lacked in flavor and spice. he told the ownerstaff about it and he was kind enough to bring some spicy beef dish for my husband to try and that too free of charge. the restaurant itself is nice, probably one of the better decorated ethiopian restaurants i have been to. the air circulation within the restaurant leaves something to be desired. while we were there they must have just started cooking but the restaurant was filled with a slight smoke and both my husband and i had irritated eyes the whole time while we were waiting for our food. service was slow even though we were the only ones there. its a fairly new restaurant so maybe they are working out their kinks. i might give them a try again if im close to the area but i am not sure i would make the 40 min drive just for that unlike some other ethiopian places i know. still worth a try.
i was a little wary of this place, given that i came here on a rainy night and there was no one here besides my party, but it turned out to be very good! the place isnt much to look at, a small storefront in a fairly dead plaza. they have a big tv on the counter very old school. i came with my dad and step mom and we ordered two things to share, the vegetarian sampler and the fim tibs. we werent sure if this would be enough, but we ended up having leftovers! the vegetarian plate was good, there were many different items on the plate, and, honestly, i dont know what many of them were, but they were all tasty. the fim tibs beef with onion and jalapeno was ridiculously tasty. it was served in this contraption that had a fire inside, keeping the beef and veggies sizzling hot for the whole meal! the beef was so frickin tasty, i want some more right now. they also gave us some spicy powder... add that to the mix and youre set. i would definitely come back!
really liked the popcorn shrimp. not greasy at all. reminded me of tempura. fries are seasoned just right. clam chowder soup really really good. but no crackers. oh well. cant wait  to try other items on the menu.
outstanding flavor and a decent price. just need to find out where their fish come from. if usa in origin, thats great. if vietnam or other asian country.....might make it more harmful than healthy.   will post when i find out.
im a fan. grilled fish w healthy side options fast and reasonably priced. first visit today. i got the grilled mahi w zucchini and creamed corn. it was grilled to order so expect to wait a little longer than a typical fast food place but not a long wait by any means maybe 8 min?.  friendly workers and the place was clean. i will definitely return.
i saw the announcement of this restaurants opening in the business journal. being a seattle native, and quite used to fresh seafood, i was encouraged to try it along with my brother. on a week night, we were warmly greeted by owner rully and his staff. i ordered the java ahi tuna with vegetables and brown rice. the tuna was cooked al dente...just right, fresh, firm, moist and flavorful. the vegetables were also al dente...fresh, crisp, steamed just right. we liked the concept, ambience and food...a great value for seafood in the desert today. rully was very engaging with customers, came over to visit our table, as well as another familys table. you could see his passion for his new business, and strong desire to please customers. he brought us a sample of their clam chowder, which was outstanding! hand cut potatoes, bigger chunks of clams, and a tasty broth less full than typical white chowder. our only disappointment was the calamari appetizer, too overcooked, not al dente as the other dishes. we wouldnt order that again, but well definitely be back to try other entrees. rully is expanding with more locations in metro phoenix, which should be successful with his commitment to quality!
im always skeptical about fish away from water but this place surprised me. i ordered the swai white fish with java sauce. sooo yummy! moist fish, not fishy at all so you know it was as fresh as it could be, and the sauce was super tasty. i paired it with grilled zucchini and the garlic fries  both flavorful and perfectly cooked. to share with my office mates i ordered the calamari. i give it a c. not a huge fan of the balsamic drizzle and it seemed too chewy. sent it back with a coworker who went to get lunchbox herself after tasting mine and the managerowner refunded my card plus gave me a free entree card. wow! he recalled my order and shared that he thinks it was overcooked. very impressed with the customer service  all staff was very friendly wearing smiles. will absolutely be back for more than my free meal!
scottsdale bro perspective: good clean and fast protein meal. it is like a chipotle without the tortillas and meat. if the owner is reading this...you should include tortillas as a side item. everyone loves a fish taco place out here. besides that the place is perfect for your quick healthy mealseeker. yes they have their downfalls right now...they are brand new. coleslaw was not what the pretty little cashier said it was going to be, but she was cute, so i am not even mad. to be honest its good fish idk if its fresh but it taste great and its great concept. do not listen to all the haters. give it try. thank you, ben
im a seafood lover and living in the desert, theres always been a big void in quality seafood...until now.  just heard about ahi mahi and rushed down to try this new offering.  even sweeter was their 50 entree special.  i had grilled salmon, brown rice and grilled zucchini.  he tried the sweet glazed chicken with fries and coleslaw.  and we shared a popcorn shrimp appetizer with a spicy tasty sauce on the side.  everything was fresh and tasty.  one snag  no dressing on the cole slaw but they gave us a side of dressing when we asked.  portions are very ample.  i ended up taking half of my salmon meal home.  for a return visit, think id like to try several appetizers  shrimp again!! and fish sticks, add a side of fresh veggies or french fries and weve got lunch.nice atmospere but temp was a little hot  muggy on our afternoon visit, maybe they are still working out the ac deal.  great friendly service, reasonable prices, clean and wellstocked condiment bar.  good work, ahi mahi.  im looking forward to a long seafood relationship.
pretty tasty for a discount fish place. might be a little pricey for some for lunch as you can spend between 12 and 15 pretty easily. the salmon was very good but, like another reviewer said, was a little overwhelmed with the sauce because the pieces of salmon are pretty thin. i love sauce so it didnt bother me!  most people wouldnt want to wait as long as it would take to cook a big thick piece of salmon though. the salad was fresh and pretty good. i wasnt super impressed with the dressing.  i got garlic fries but couldnt detect any garlic on the fries. but they were very good plain fries. overall, i would say its a good value for the money.  i like the concept and the interior was very hip and upbeat. good atmosphere.
healthy  very reasonably priced. fast food thats so different from everything else. loved it and will go back often! i got the grilled mahi mahi topped with their tomato concasse a smokey tomato sauce, grilled zucchini, and brown rice. it was perfect!
this place is an exceptional value at an exceptional price.ive had both the salmon and the mahi mahi with the dry rub seasoning. large portion, perfectly cooked, and delicious. everything about the place is a little unique. you pick one of seven fish choices with the option of 4 sauces with two sides. the food is rich with flavor from the fresh fish to the healthy coleslaw. everything i had was well prepared and tasty. and the atmosphere is not for date night but clean and spacious.what are you waiting for....go!
great food, great staff, great concept. only reason i didnt give 5 stars is because its always been a little hot and humid when i go in, and the type of music they play. it gets pretty loud and with the techno beat of the music, it can be hard to have a conversation. each time ive gone in, its been an over 30 crowd, so im guessing im not alone in this. if those two things get fixed it will be 5 stars for me!
my parents introduced my husband and i to this restaurant, which is really a fast casual concept. i ordered the salmon and chicken, which came with 2 sides. i got the zucchini and brown rice for the sides. everything i ate was very good and it comes on a good size plate. i was hungry again a few hours later though. its very healthy here so definitely check this place out if youre searching for a healthy and tasty spot!
solid fast casual.  mahi mahi with the tomato sauce was pretty good, not dry at all.  i loved the cole slaw!!!!  i think the concept is pretty cool, but the prices seem a wee bit high.  id like to try the steak next time.  the portions are solid and the food is a little elevated so it may justify the price if they are consistent and bring the same quality more often than not.
finally, something different and exciting for a quick meal! we have been four or five times now and been very satisfied. the staff is warm and inviting and the restaurant is very clean and aesthetically pleasing. most times we get the glazed beef over brown rice and the grilled zucchini. very tasty!
wanted to stop for a quick bite. hungry for fish. so we choose ahi mahi. friendly greeting at the door. female cashier very informative about menu items and answered questions with a smile. i ordered cajun fish tacos. it came with two 3 oz tacos, no sides. tasty and just the right portion for me. bob ordered cajun mahi mahi. it came with 2 sides. he had rice and salad. he said the cajun seasoning had just the right kick to it. the food is fresh and made to order. this is a great concept for a restaurant!  serve  specialize in something different and appealing, something healthy, and made fresh in front of you. mmmmm makes us wanna come back! :
good place to eat, good food and good service, price is reasonable as well. place is nice and clean
amazing food i tried the tilapia grilled cajun with grilled zucchini and brown rice the tilapia tasted very fresh and there was just enough spice to it with the cajun bam the zucchini need a little more salt and pepper but that to taste the brown rice was just regular brown rice but i didnt expect anything great when it comes to brown rice portion sides were even for what you payed for the employees were very friendly and offered me samples since it was my first time sampled the clam chowder it was great will get a full bowl next time
3.5 stars... for only being open a week it really isnt that bad. i didnt try and of their salads or sandwiches, not many vegan choices. the smoothie i had was a berry smoothie and i asked for granola on top cause i was in a mood for a smoothie bowl which they didnt have. the owner was really nice and we have him some suggestions.definitely a lot to work on but give it a shot, just a tad overpriced. you also hand to pay more for addone which i think should already in the smoothie. but they tasted very fresh!
what a great place. was not sure how it would be when we walked in, but i was very pleased on the way out. we used to go here when it was daphnes,and were sad when they closed. happy to report,this new place is wonderful. i had the salmon entree and it was quite good. i dont know what they use to make the rice that came with it, but it was my favorite part of the meal. friendly staff low price point for this area. we will be back for sure. i hope they stay..
this place has great product and the food is fresh! i would recommend getting the house dressing with whatever salad you get because you wont find that anywhere else! its so delicious and unique. the garlic sauce is on point as well! theres something for everyone from the vegan to the meat lover!
ever since i got back from taiwan, i havent gotten a single taiwanese beef noodle soup that tastes genuine, up until today. its not featured on the menu but locals love it. the reason why this soup is legit is because the broth is made out of beef bones so its packed with flavour, and behind it is a taiwanese chef who trained in japanese cuisine. their tea is particularly tasty with the addition of roasted nuts and rice. the pancakes come filled with red beans or taro, but taro was the best. i have yet to try their japanese menu.
hidden gem of a restaurant that you would definitely pass by if not for a local yelper bozan who has inside knowledge of how amazing the specialty beef noodle soup is here. really it sure is outstanding for taiwanese beef noodle soup. the broth is wonderfully rich in flavour. so rich yet not salty and a great mix of tender fall off the bone meat plus shanghai bok chop with a chewy noodle. if you are into pho you must try this soup as its different yet flavour is out of this world!  a bowl of soup on a cold fallwinter day is an amazing way to warm up the body. they also offer a hot chilli sauce to zip it up another notch if spicy is to your liking. the restaurant is simple yet decor is clean and comfortable. the husband and wife team do also special taiwanese cookies which we got to sample the pineapple filled ones which were a pleasant finish to a big bowl of soup. service was friendly and we were the only ones in the restaurant on the visit so we had more personal explanations of their culture with some jokes thrown in.price wise its extremely inexpensive at around 10 a bowl. the crew that came left with full tummies and content satisfaction. the menu is small but you can sense they care to serve you their home cooking plus dedication to delivering a top notch meal! i havent found many places in mtl that specilaze in taiwanese food. there is not a huge offering on the menu as they have mainly chinese dishes plus some sushi but the soup is out of this world!  im definitely coming back to sample more dishes of the menu specifically speaking their stir frys.
new hot club in vegas! valet service is fast and on point! staff is very attractive! music is great.. play most up to date music. recommended!
excellent place love the music finally a nice club with latin music and they play everything salsa,merengue, bachata..etc highly recommend thursday nights.only gave 4 stars because i think they should have a dress code for guys, such a nice place they should dress to impress. overall loved it im going back every thursday... :
good music to dance to.. if your looking for a more laid back experience than a more traditional club on the strip, but still a good time with good music this is the place:
im a big fan of sur la table and have been eagerly awaiting their madison opening!  this is a great little kitchen shop, with a range of products from very affordable to more high end.  their cookware line is fantastic  i have an 8 nonstick saute pan which cooks up perfect eggs with no oil or fat needed and washes up clean.they frequently have sales, so if theres a big ticket item you want  watch for specials!
the cooking classes at sur la table are always fun. my husband and i have attended both an asian noodle class and a croissant making class. the instructors are knowledgable and make the classes fun! you leave with a full belly and a cookbook of all the items you learn to make in their on site kitchen. this is a great christmas, anniversary, or birthday gift for any food lover. oh, and you get a 10 off coupon for the store during your class!
so glad there is finally a store front in madison!  sur la table has been my go to house warmingweddingbridal showerbirthday one stop gift shop for years when traveling thru chicago.  something to offer everyone at various price points and always great sales!  looking forward to taking a cooking class in the near future!  way to go, hilldale!
saw an article in vegas eater about this place, and since i worked a straight 8 hours, decided on the ayce lunch menu.  i had the spider roll, the only roll ill order, and thes rest was nigiri  tako, hokkigai, maguro, super white tuna, albacore with jalapeno, hamachi, halibut, unagi and ikura.  i was surprised that there was no snapper.  they did have amaebi with the heads, and uni for patrons who pay ayce dinner prices.  chef was kind enough to give me a sample of the uni since he just got a new shipment, small, but tasty has that uni blast, but not overbearing like it was quasiwasabi like with good texture yes, its soft and slippery, but not slimy.  oh, and there was fresh wasabi for an extra 1.50 that was well worth it considering the portion, and the offer to refill it as it was starting to empty.  i ordered tempura that tasted like the fryer needed to replace the oil, and mussels that had a big heaping of mayo and, so it took the grade down to 4 stars, but a worthwhile ayce sushi place nonetheless.
friendly staff and the owner is so sweet and such an awesome personality! the sushi was good and at a reasonable price. got the all you can eat. we were the only customers in on a sunday night. food came out pretty fast. if you search this place on iphone maps it does not have the correct directions. must search using like google maps.
amazing. we were the only ones at the bar and our chef gave us his full attention offering us recipes that were off the menu and specific to our liking. atmosphere was a tad off...at one point eminems hit superman was on...in a fancy sushi restaurant. overall amazing and would recommend it to anyone that loves genuine, fresh sushi!
my girlfriends  i yelped this place since were from outta town  were craving some sushi. the food was amazing  the service was good too. the owner a young woman i think? even gave us ice cream. the only thing is when my friend  i ordered our bento boxes we didnt get the miso soup  when i asked about it the male server said i had to request it,  also my bento came with no salad. i thought that was a little odd since the menu said it came with it, but no biggie, then fish was fresh  rolls were amazing anyways! :
22 dollars for all you can eat! great deal and amazing sushi. top it all off with some jo eu bread ice cream dessert. yum
great prices, open late, great service and clean. came here for a late night sushi craving at 1:30am and i was pleasantly surprised!
excellent food! some of the freshest sushi ive experienced. service got slow when they got busy. as a new restaurant they are obviously working out the kinks in their system. one of the chefs come to our table to aliviate our frustration and i found that more than reassuring.
trying out new place for all you can eat sushi. they have really good stuff here. my favorite is super white tuna with jalapenos. i like their tuna poke and sexy lady special.i wouldve given them 5 stars but the oyster took a long time to come out and also our last order consists of shrimp, sweet shrimp and tamago order. it took about 15 minutes gap in between.service is good. you do have to ask for more tea from the server even tho you are paying 2.50 for hot tea.for dessert, we got honey toast and yuzu sorbet. yuzu sorbet is a great way to finish the meal. very light and refreshing!we were there for about 2 hours, longer than i wanted to but the food was good so cant complain much.
ayce sushi sounds a little sketchy. but this place is every bit as good as typical sushi restaurants. i thought the sushi might be premade, but its to order. there were a couple of rolls i ordered that came with crab but it was more of a crab salad  i was a bit surprised but it was still very good. the wait can be a little long after you put in your order, but thats not atypical when youre eating sushi.what would have been a 5 star review  if based on food and value  became a 4 star because of the service inaccuracy. we ordered twice and both times the server forgot to put in one of our rolls with the kitchen.
ate here about 4:45 pm on sun21 sep: server kelly? was great. food was great. with ayce you can order anything on the menu and the chefs specials of the day sign posted near the entrance.  unfortunately they were out of kalbi korean ribs.  free drink with a yelp checkin 2.50 value for a soda, free refills. sushi way and jjanga seem onpar with each other.  i would prefer sushi way if im on the eastside, and jjanga if im on the westside. the plaza its in seems to have lots of restaurants i should try eg urban turban.  concentra clinic is also here so should i need to endure a 2 hr wait for nonemergency medical help, this plaza is a good choice to dine  wait.
bookmarked this place to try in the hopes of finding an ayce competitor to yama, and i got to try it out with the boyfriend this past weekend. in terms of taste, this place is really good. it also has an impressive menu. i liked the fact that they gave us an ayce and a regular menu. the food is what has me giving this place 4 stars. favorites from what we ordered: tuna poke salad, seaweed salad, yolo special roll love the fried onions on top to complimentbalance the roll, chicago fire roll had enough spice for the boyfriend, japanese lasagna roll always a fave for us, honey bread reminds me of a cinnamon roll with ice cream instead of frosting, and the fried tempura ice cream tasted like fruity pebbles cereal.honestly knocked one star off cause of customer service we experienced early in our dinner. it was nice to be greeted and seated right away. what wasnt cool was waiting for a waitress take our order about 10 minutes after we had been given water by the initial host to the evening. umm... we didnt have our phones out, distracted from looking at the menu. i will admit that it got slightly better after getting our appetizers, but when we were trying to order the sushi, the waitress was nowhere near our table. i look up and around the restaurant for her, and shes at the cashwrap area, leaning against the counter or whatever, talking to the host that seated us. the boyfriend said he observed her there for awhile, but just didnt want to point it out to further irritate me. i was about ready to leave when a waiter we hadnt seen earlier came by to get a sushi order. big thanks to that gentleman. we never got 1 order of sushi i asked for, but no biggie cause he checked up on us more than our waitress, who i only saw pick up our plates, not saying a word to us. the host even checked on us more  asked about sodawater refills, and brought me the sake cooler i asked for. the fastest service i got from her was when she brought the check and picked it up in less than 5 minutes. what the...?
a group of 6 of us went here for lunch on saturday. we arrived right at opening time, and wanted to sit at the bar, but were immediately ushered to a table. i always prefer to sit at the bar, and since the place was empty, i was surprised that we were basically forced to a table. we all ordered the all you can eat lunch, which at 21.95 is worth it, since that is the cost of about 2 rolls. i love nigiri as well, so the value was definitely there.  all the food was decent and came out very quickly since we were the only ones there.  when the nigiri came out, if multiple people ordered the same, it all came out on the same plate. the food tasted fresh, and looked appetizing when it came out. this place would have gotten five stars except that we were forced to sit at tables instead of the bar.
chef specials:super white tuna sashimi w jalapeno  fish was fresh and the mixture of sauce and jalapeno was good. it wasnt salty at all.wasabi tobiko  i actually liked it. tasted fresh and different than most things i eat at sushi spots.appetizers:screaming orgasm  this was ok. the fish was different than say sushimon.fresh oyster  it was fresh and goodcoconut shrimp tempura  i loved it.  it was flavorful :rolls:i love my ass  goodsnow white  goodjack rabbit  goodnigiri:salmon roe  average. same quality you would find in most restaraunts at their levelgarlic tuna  it was fresh. didnt really care for the salt or spice they out on top of it.salmon  kinda tasted like scottish salmon. it melted in my mouth! yellowtail  it was averagefresh scallop  it was averagesweet shrimp  it was averagethe tempura ice cream was the same like you would get at most spots.my son said the honey bread was ok.will i come back? maybe. this is out of the way for me because i live near mountains edge. theres other spots around the area that i can eat at. the service was ok. felt like they couldve done better. i did receive excellent service from jay. the lady that waited are table first didnt talk too much but she was nice enough to give my baby girl a lollipop to stop her from crying.
love this off the strip sushi joint. we ate off the all you can eat menu and the food was amazing. service was very friendly and prompt throughout the entire meal. unlike many all you can eat menus, the choices were very creative and delicious. definitely will come here again during my next trip into town.  try the honey bun for desert. you wont be disappointed.
if you dont want to wait for goyemon come here.  quality is on point and the size of their nigiri is pretty perfect.  so close to giving this place 5 stars but the order time was just a bit slow but its ok the quality of the food makes up for it.
newer ayce sushi place off paradise near hughes centerwent with few buddies to get some food after lees wine experience....needed something to soak up all that alcohol!it wasnt too crowded, i think mainly because this location is better suited for business crowd during the weekguess i can go down a list of what we tried....at least what i can remember!started with a few orders of shrimp tempura, pretty good, light, fried nicelyhad a few nigiri....salmon, hamachi, unagi, all were really good, nicely sliced, good fishrice ratiotried the white tunajalapeno from board.....do try that if you go, really nice slices of tuna with small piece of jalapeno on top....just the right amount....tastyyellowtail collar....a must if they have! grilled nicely, good sized meaty pieces, accompanied with a soyponzu dip i think that was mix.....nice grill flavorwe had some bacon wrapped scallops...i know, nothing special, but they were really good too, we actually reordered these quite a few times, they go nicely with beer!only couple misses i would say were the calamari tempura, which was ok, not exceptional, and the screaming orgasm, which was just ok as welli know, we didnt dive into a whole lot of actual sushi dishes, but then again, that was after 34 hours of drinking at the lees event!one of my buddies didnt eat raw fish, i know sushi was wrong choice for him, but jun, the ownerchef was very accommodating, recommending and creating a number of rolls for him too eat.  he was pretty happy with just the kama and scallops though.  he did like some of the rolls made for him, but just didnt care for nori....again sushi probably not best choice for him to dine.....oh well, rest of us enjoyed, more for us!!!  i did try a few pieces of what was made for him, good, but a lot of them had cream cheese, dont really care for that when eating sushi!i will definitely have to return here soonservice was great, place was not loud at all, nice and cozywill mark it as one of the better sushi restaurants in the city!
this is a cool new place in town! the fish was fresh and full of flavors! the salmon is not a very big cut but the rice portion is small so its balance! its not busy for a saturday noon so the service was fast! our waitress was really nice! she went back and forth to ask us if we need anything and she didnt forget our order! definitely come back here soon
i love sushiway! this is one of my newest late night sushi place in vegas. i have been here 4,5 times. they provide a lot of nigiri and the eel hand roll is my favorites. the nigiri is very fresh also. only complaint is one server she is really slow and  not really friendly. it took long time to serving our table.
ok, second visit....not quite as good as first, but still decentstarted off with bacon wrapped scallops of course.....yuman order of shrimp tempura and vegetable tempura too, good, nothing special, but goodhamachi kama, gotta get these if they have them available....simple grilled collars with a ponzu sauce to dip in....not necessary, good by itselffirst round of nigiri, ordered salmon belly, uni, unagi, and hamachithe owner jinjun sorry not clear on which prepared our first round of sushieverything was great, buttery, melt in your mouth goodpause for another round of bacon wrapped scallops!and we snuck in an order of salmon tar tar, really good, layered on top of crab and avocadosecond round of sushi, ordered salmon belly again, super white tuna wjalapeno, tuna, and a spider roll....have to order 1 roll at least right?in any case, his apprentice prepared this order, and you could really tell his knife skills lacked, as the fish did not have the same consistency as our first roundsome of the slices were uneven and he cut against the grain incorrectly, as the salmon belly was a bit chewy rather than soft and buttery in texturein any case, that about wrapped up this visitfinished with some orange slices and green tea ice creami will be sure to visit again, but i will make sure we sit in owners section this time so we can enjoy this place to its fullest!keep you posted!
the sushi was very fresh! i did the dinner all you can eat and by the time i was done, i was filled to the top!!!  the chef allows you to order any item on the menu. it was definitely worth the price.
if you are a visitor to las vegas and use your iphone map application, it will send you to bahama breeze.   but, sushi way is actually on the other side of paradise. so, look out for that.  this place is great!  the staff are super friendly, the food is wonderful and the atmosphere is nice.  i will return whenever i am in las vegas.
big surprise here... new restaurant for my news crew on our most recent las vegas trip and we went in expecting an ok meal for an ayce sushi experience and came away impressed, stuffed, and looking forward to our next visit. very good and friendly service, really good sushi, along with a variety of interesting nonsushi choices and an overall highvalue experience. i never give five stars on a single experience... but this was visit was tempting... looking forward to seeing how this place holds up in future visits.
saw the reviews and decided to try this place out. right when we walked in we were greeted and seated within seconds. richard served us and he is awesome! he definitely made our first time a great time! the menu for ayce is nicely organized so it made ordering food easy. the names for some of the rolls are pretty funny. richard tries to catch you off guard so you can say i love my ass name of a roll haha. look out for him, hes awesome! the presentation for the rolls were absolutely stunning especially the cherry blossom roll beware this roll is loaded with avocado. they didnt drench the rolls with sauces and the fish tasted pretty fresh. all the rolls we ordered were delicious. the chicken teriyaki bento was worth it! so definitely try that too! this is gonna be added to our list of sushi spots. dont forget to ask for a stamp card so you can get an ayce for free.
your typical place for ayce sushi. their rice portion is at its minimum but its good because you can eat a lot more. there is a time limit for the ayce 60 minutes for lunch and 90 minutes for dinner.my boyfriend and i ordered a lot from the nigiri items than the rolls and everything we ordered there were great. there was only on server, which was hard to order  faster than usual but she was nice.
yelp 300 challenge 2015: 300 goal achieved!saturday solo sushiround 3this past saturday 1212th, i arrived here after 2 unsuccessful attempts to eat at other ayce sushi restaurants, that i walked out of due to a combination of bad service, questionable sanitary practices and no fresh oysters and ayce limits on salmon roe. so here i am  sushi way on paradise rd., 2 blocks n. of flamingo, for my 3rd attempt of the evening to feast on ayce sushi. im pleased to write the quote three times a charm as sushi way is a fantastic ayce sushi restaurant.modern interior w plenty of pretty christmas decor, house music  top hits playing as background music from pandora, friendly service from start to finish by the host and all employees. this enjoyable 90 minute ayce delicious sushi dinner was competitively priced  26.95. tip for the ladies: they offer 12 rolls so you can try a variety and not fill up so quickly.i sat in a comfortable chair at the l shaped granite counter sushi bar and began w a cold raspberry iced tea, fresh oysters and at least a half a dozen salmon roe with a stuffed santa claus as my dining partner.the sushi chef was welcoming, filled w smiles and had plenty of enthusiasm. his talents offered several hand crafted culinary works of art in a timely manner. he clearly loves his job here at sushi way! he prepared several delicious rolls ive never tried and some of my favorites that also tasted excellent. the halibut was cut thick w excellent rice consistency. jalapeno slices adorned the yellowtail belly sashimi. the spider roll was very good w warm shrimp tempura. the alaskan and hawaiian rolls were flavorful favorites. baked green mussels topped w a hot cheese sauce. poke tuna salad was excellent! garlic yellowtail was spicy good. the sexy lazy special was a delight consisting of coconut shrimp tempura  cream cheese, topped w salmon, avocado  coconut flakes, w a spicy mayo sauce. yum!the rock  roll special was also a delight consisting of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white fish and crab wrapped in cucumber, topped w orgasm sauce. lolfor dessert, i turned down the several offerings for 2 sea creatures. the octopus had a perfect crunch and seawater taste. eel had a smooth texture w warm sweet sauce that ended my saturday solo sushi.yay! im a fan.see 14 photos below...yelp 300 challenge 2015: 300 goal achieved!
with multiple sushi joints popping up in vegas, how does one stay ahead of the pack? well, theres a no brainer here! quality and service are on top of my list of what i look for.i didnt stumble onto sushi way. it was under hot and new so i gave it a shot! i always prefer to be seated at the bar, so i can interact with the chef. its also very entertaining to watch them prepare my meal.and wow! i was very impressed by the temperature of the sushi and the fish to rice ratio was excellent.i was even more impressed that the chef kept making items that were off menu! i was game for anything! i love that this place doesnt use a lot of cream cheese in their sushi as fillers! if i want to eat cream cheese, i have lots in my fridge! lolhaving an option for sushi half rolls is another reason i consider when dining in and im glad this place offers that! some places only do half rolls on your last order. then theres the awesome staff at sushi way. where they treat you in an awesome way!
my brother and i got a key lime pie and it was pretty amazing, except for the price. it was over 5 and i cried. other than that, the place was really chic and i even loved the cookies and cream cupcake sample that they gave me.
i came across this place while walking with the intention of going to another food place in the area. i had never seen or heard of the place, and i almost missed it. i bet if they go the word out more they would do better.but i must say that the food i had was pretty good and the service was nice. the lady informed me that she and her daughter opened the place four months ago, so i like that its a small shop. i had the turkey pesto panini. she had let me try a bit of the pastrami, which was also good, but the turkey, pesto, spinach and mozzarella just sounded too good. it did take a little while to make, but i figure thats not a horrible thing. at one point the daughter came out and said the turkey pesto is her favorite. the short interaction with her was nice too. and the time it took to make the sandwich gave me time to ask a friend what kind of cupcake he wanted. the cupcakes look delicious. i saw several comments about samples, but they didnt have any while i was there.the panini was pretty good, and it came with a pasta salad or you can choose potato salad or chips. thats wasnt the most flavorful, but it wasnt bad. i got a sweet potato cupcake and a chocolate peanut butter cupcake. havent tried those yet, but i cant wait. they also have ice cream and other desserts that looks great.my only hang up is the prices. the cupcakes are 3.25 plus tax each. the panini was 7.99, which isnt horrible but also isnt cheap. with a fountain drink i paid over 17. for lunch for one person and two cupcakes. for a place that doesnt have a reputable, established name yet, that seems pretty steep.but overall a good experience.
ok, so here is the sad part. i didnt actually get to try it. but the dozen plus one cupcakes i got for a group loved them. i popped in to grab a little thank you treat, and was pleasantly surprised to meet one of the owners family she was so friendly, and helpful. the decor is adorable, and not over the top. sometimes when people go the route of log, rustic, it just comes across horrendously ugly. this is tastefully  done. almost like urban rustic. yep. that just happened. new genre of interior decorating. but you dont care about the decor really. you care about the cupcakes. it was love from everyone. i did get to try the mousse, which i wish i had a bowl of right now instead of this crappy tea, but if you get a chance, stop in. love places like this and i hope they do great!
my office coworkers stared in envy while i ate my birthday cupcake. i tried to savor it, but it was sooo good i ended up gobbling it up instead.  guess i gotta try again.
the food was good. i really enjoyed it. very nice atmosphere for a japanese express.. will be returning
my girlfriend and i were so excited that a japanese express restaurant opened nearby. we were even more excited to see that they were offering 20 off of the entire meal for their grand opening special. it was very clean and the staff were very friendly. i had the bento box steak hibachi, spicy tuna roll, squid salad, and brown rice and my girlfriend got the hibachi chicken. the portions were of great size and the food tasted amazing. the steak was cooked medium well and the chicken was not undercooked nor overcooked  just perfect! our only complaint would be the shrimp sauce. the consistency was a little thick and more on the sweeter side, and i do not feel that the one dram cup was enough for the amount of food they gave us. overall, i think this place was great! we definitely will be returning.
nice clean restaurant. great service and good food.  they are giving 20 off for their grand opening.
pretty good for quick order japanese. they have a sushi menu and various cooked dishes, so everyone should be able to find something that they can eat.i chose the chicken teriyaki bento box, going with crab salad, california roll and brown rice. i could hear the chicken start cooking as soon as my order was placed, so i know its fresh. the crab salad was surimi of course. topped with spicy sauce and on top of a tangy vinegar, it was pretty good. the california rolls were nothing special. the chicken was fresh and hot with some onions and broccoli mixed in and sesame seeds sprinked on top. brown rice was not very fresh a little crunchy, but it was 4 in the afternoon.over all, a reasonable meal. even when the 20 grand opening discount goes away, its not bad. its certainly fresher and probably healthier than the buffet at the other end of this little building.
this is the newest in the chain of restaurants owned by flo. this is my preliminary review, as the restaurant has only been open for two days and like all new places it has a few things to work out.i arrived at 6:30 and was seated immediately. i was offered a libation and ordered a diet coke, the only diet drink on the menu. i would have ordered iced tea except that the only sweetener available was what many restaurants have removed from their tables in favor of splenda. unfortunately, the carbonator on the soft drink line was not working properly and my diet coke was mostly syrup and water.the restaurant was nice looking, but was all hard surfaces making for a somewhat noisy environment. the addition of some soft hangings or some carpet would ameliorate the amount of sound.first ordered were spicy wontons and chinese lettuce cups. the wontons had good texture and i loved the very light wrapper around it. the flavor was very light as was the spice but i would order it again. unfortunately, i cannot say the same for the lettuce wraps. my plate contained a half head of lettuce which was not taken apart at all, so my first order of things to do was to tear apart a half head of lettuce. in doing this a number of the leaves broke apart, leaving me with broken leaves to place the contents on and later drip down my hands. the filling did not impress me as it seemed to lack flavor which the accompanying sauces could not make up for.next was the hot and sour soup. a lovely bowl of properly gelatinous soup swimming with all sorts of goodies including very fresh shrimp. i added some vinegar and chili oil and it tasted just like i remember from china. this soup was dynamite! id have loved a bit of ogo in it but it was a great soup.next was kung pao chicken. one of the ingredients in it was zucchini which was a nice surprise since so many places use celery. a second nice surprise happened when i was served both white and brown rice. while white rice is traditional in oriental cookery, the brown rice is a nice addition for those who prefer a healthier option or prefer the nutty taste of it. the chicken was cooked to perfection, but once again the dish seemed to lack in the flavor department. it seemed to be lacking the heat and flavor that should be part of the dish, as well as the peanuts that i could not find.i was brought ma po tofu to try. it was made with regular peppers, and while the ingredients were all there, none of the heat was. i wish it had been made with real szechuan peppercorns which would have made it an authentic dish even if it had to cost more.last was the chocolate wontons. half wontons cooked till hardened then covered in a dark chocolate sauce plated with a slice of orange and dusted with powdered sugar. i appreciated the interplay of the orange and chocolate, but there was no way to eat it without getting my fingers dipped in chocolate too. not that that is necessarily bad for a chocolate lover, but getting cleaned up afterward without a wet nap is a problem.overall, as a new opening there are a few problems to be ironed out, especially in the flavor area. most of the food seemed cooked beautifully but lacking all sorts of seasoning. while flo is noted for healthy variations in her food, she is not known for lack of flavor and i am hoping that this will be worked out by my next visit in a few months. if i had to sum up the food in one word it would be fresh. the food was anything but tired and worn out and the use of nice fresh ingredients was apparent.the restaurant seemed spotless. the waitstaff was a little confused but that is to be expected in a new opening. the cashier needs to know that sitting on the counter where the register is does not look nice and is unacceptable.im giving 4 stars for quality of ingredients and for service in a new environment. next time i hope to give 4 stars for flavor as well. as my readers know, i do not accept free meals, and after paying for my dinner i found that the  charge on my card had been voided and the meal had been comped. in keeping with my precepts, i have donated the cost of the meal to a local charity.
welcome to tempe.  happy hour is 37 with 12 price apps  alcohol drinks.  place was busy but service was still great.  we ordered from the appetizer menu thai calamari, thai shrimp skewers, chinese lettuce wraps  crispy spring rolls.  quick service, water glasses filled  yummy food.  we will come back soon.if you need gluten free they have lots to choose from.
flos asian has finally made it to tempe!we have been fans of flos of scottsdale since she opened her 1st restaurant in scottsdale! so its great theyre open now in the heart of tempe, at baseline  rural rd.great interior design...such a nice, bright open feel!we had excellent service and the food did not disappoint! we started off with  12 price appetizers, crab puffs  spicy wontons. happy hr. is every day from 37pm with 12 price drinks also! for the main course, i got the cashew chicken and my partner got the kung pao chicken. all were as delicious as we remembered!at the end of our dinner, flo herself came out to the table to check on us  thank us and wished me a happy birthday! we topped off the delicious meal with complimentary scrumptious chocolate won tons! well be back for sure! way to go flo!
one of the best asian restaurants in tempe!! food is tasty, menu is limited for veggies but who cares when you are pure nonvegitarian :p loved the ambience and service was really good. sure will come back and suggest my friends :
very good. .. glad to see  eat  fresh hot food. very polite and well kept. i will be back
very delicious food. 40 minute wait though.  since its only been open a short time hopefully the fad will fade away and have more reasonable wait times,  we ordered the spicy and crisp chicken.  could certainly have been more spicy but it was tasty.  prices are on the high end for asian food.
flos is a great place to eat at,but would like them to have the chop sticks already at the table that you are sitting at.other wise the food is great.
who doesnt love flos!this review is only for their lunch menu, but lets face it  it is all delicious! the lunch menu is such a great deal for the food that is prepared for you. tried the chicken chow fun and katsu chicken, and both dishes were fresh and extremely tasty. my mother and i both said, wow, this fried rice is amazing! i would highly recommend for anyone needing an option to select. we both needed to go boxes to bring the rest of our food home!the interior decor kind of relaxes me and feels zen. i will be a regular of flos as long as their around!
great hh specials! the 7 of us ordered delicious cocktails and tigertsingtao beer...everyone enjoyed the lettuce wraps chicken and tofu, wings takes 20min, crab puffs, mongolian beef and spring rolls. everything was tasty! it is newer so a slight wait on our server as it got more busy for hh and dinner. it is a cute place and cannot wait to use the patio when it gets cooler. expect us to go there again!
yum yum yum!!! this is a newer place in tempe, a sister property of the one in north scottsdale.  having been to the scottsdale location i was hoping for good things when i saw the tempe location opened in the whole foods complex.  they did not disappoint!  food is extremely fresh, asian flair, i had the pad thai with shrimp, calamari not great but overall a very good experience with good staff!  would definitely return!
excellent first impression, and on takeout. she had the fried honey beef and i had the seafood sizzling rice guo ba. normally i dont let my first visit anywhere include a seafood dish, but i sure am glad i did. the food was delicious, prepared entirely on time, and the staff was very friendly when i arrived.were looking forward to dining in, and expect the next review to become a 55 for us. nice looking place, in and out!
happy to have a good asian place in the neighborhood! i cannot believe this used to be mcdonalds. they did a really amazing job making the place over. for a former fast food joint stuck with another ol strip mall they managed to make this place feel inviting yet open and airy.okay, on to the food. my boyfriend and i started out our meal with the regular lettuce wraps. they were really good. i could have just eaten these as my meal. we would have liked a little more sauce for them though  mostly because the sauce added so much flavor to it. for our entrees i went with a chicken and veggies dish  it was a slight variation on the chicken and veggie stir fry and my boyfriend got sweet  sour chicken. the portions were huge  we definitely could have shared. and i liked that they gave us both white and brown rice  perfect for a little mix and match. the ingredients tasted fresh and the dishes were very flavorful. overall we really enjoyed our meal. and then we enjoyed it the next day as leftovers, too. well definitely be back.
have heard about this place for years and finally went.  made reservations, but still had to wait 30 minutes, but they did extend happy hour prices for us since we had to wait.  food was good, service very friendly, but it was very noisy.  once happy hour ended at 7pm, it quieted down.  they appear to be extremely busy during the happy hour.  will definitely go again, but may just get take out.
great prices, nice atmosphere, and the food is fantastic.  this is the best asian restaurant around by leaps and bounds.
walking distance from my house. great portions. great hh prices. full bar. spacious environment. i dig this place.
did carryout and the food was great...glad to see in tempe!
good stuff...been to the one scottsdale several times and always enjoyed...glad they brought one to the se valley.for apps, we orders the spring rolls and the pork dumplings.  the im in love with the egg rolls at pf changs and these dont really measure up...sorry!the dumplings were amazing.  they are steamed and we had them done a bit crispy.  they were a perfect combination of steamed and lightly pan friend!  amazing!!we went with the classic cashew chicken and the kids sweet  sour chicken.  both were great.  i love this place!  we passed on desert so no review there.
yum! a little noisy but i didnt mind. they did forget the tofu on our rice and only brought out one of the two orders of spring roles we ordered.. they were quick to fix their mistake though. it was very good food with very good service!
i have gotten take out 2 times since they opened. my boyfriend and i have shared the shrimp pad thai, orange chicken, sweet and sour soup, crab wontons and kung pao chicken. everything was great! i loved the pad thai the most. we live a mile or so away so its close and easy to get to. friendly staff. i didnt give it 5 only because i havent received actual service in the restaurant... yet.
what a great surprise and a gem of a find! while some of the servers are quite young and clearly learning the ropes we all learn somewhere, sometime, the service was excellent and the food was great. it is shocking that this place was a mcdonalds for many, many years, youd never know it,...and i know it! they did a fantastic job remodeling and rebuilding to make it very open, lively, warm, welcoming and a fun atmosphere.the food was excellent!  all the ingredients were clearly fresh and each plate made to order. spices were alive and spot on. drinks were excellent! we went during happy hour and the value was incredible!! we had 4 or 5 appetizers, where were all good size and 2 drinks and the bill was less than 30,...and we were both stuffed and very, very satisfied! the manager stopped by to say hi and he was a super friendly, knowledgeable, caring guy, that was great.this is seriously one of the best restaurants in the area. we only had appetizers and drinks but the entrees on the other tables looked delicious and huge and steamy hot!! i cant wait to go back and try them. if they are as good as the apps and drinks we had, i may need to up my review to even higher.  really, stop in and try this hidden little gem, you wont be sorry!!!
went for lunch today.  place looked great inside.  we had lunch off of the appetizer menu.  lettuce wraps were fantastic, as were pot stickers.  our waitress was stephanie, and she took good care of us.  i was really impressed with the whole place and am glad to see this type of food available.  we would not hesitate to try it for dinner as well.  i found the price to be very reasonable for the quality.
went to flos in tempe for the first time, it was halloween evening, so we were served by a very tall hot dog wmustard, the service was good, thank you andrew!we started off wtwo glasses of wine and the vegetable potstickers, they were about the best ive had and the dipping sauce was delicious. i ordered the spicy cinnamon shrimp, it was beyond  excellent, very rich  and completely different than any dish i have ever eaten, this alone will keep me coming back to flos! the fried strips of crepe were a nice added touch to the dish and yummy. i needed a box to take the leftovers home.my dinner companion had the pine nut shrimp and said it was a bit bland but the broccoli was cooked to perfection.the portions are nice, not overly loaded wfood, the prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is comfortable and clean.only one reason i did not give flos 5 stars, we were seated on the southwest side of the restaurant, the sun was going down and i had a choice of the sun in my eyes or beating down on my back, my eyes won that decision but our waiter had to wear sunglasses to serve us, there are no blinds to close. i cannot imagine the summer months with the az sun interfering with my dining experience, flo, call your decorator!
ive gone to flos numerous times with various friends. in general, we have always had a positive experience. prosdecor is nice and modernhappy hour from 3:00 to 7:00pmwith half price drinks and appetizerslunch menu for smaller entrees at around 10.you can choose white or brown rice, and they let my husband substitute noodles for rice.most of the entrees me and my friends have ordered were great.bus boys are really attentiveconspot stickers are not very goodspring rolls are hit or miss. sometimes great, sometimes oily, literally dripping oil.wait staff are hit or miss. sometimes i have great service, other times they are inattentive and make me feel like i am not valued and a bother.
theres a lot to love about lush.  they have both great products and values.  their products are 100 vegetarian 80 are vegan, they dont test on animals, and use less packaging andor recycled and recyclable packaging.if youre curious about any of their products, just ask!  theyre happy to demo them for you in store.its pricey  thats for sure  but you can usually buy small quantities, and items like their bars last a long time.
rapido espresso bar is very good for a quick latte or snack on the go. the lattes are delicious and the service is very friendly. the decor inside is very cool. i would recommend the oreo doughnuts, they are to die for. the only disappointment is that there is no place to sit down, if there was a place to sit i would likely be there more than twice a week since it is so close to the concordia campus.
i went there with my husband the food was very good n as well as service by chandrasekhar.. we really enjoyed. will be back.
very yummy traditional indian.  nice surroundings and friendly service.  i have the buffet it was a little tired as i got there a half hour before it was over but all in all good indian cuisine
this review is for the lunch buffet. the staff was friendly and the food was very good full of flavor and fresh. the ice tea with the buffet is delicious. its a quaint smaller restaurant with reasonable prices. the only thing i would say is awkward is reaching for the food in the second row of the buffet. there are tongs available and glass guards to protect the food but you really have to reach to get to the food in the back of the buffet leaving the front food exposed to arms hanging over it. but that wont stop me from going back for lunch.
it is always a good sign when the ethnicity of 90 of the customers matches the ethnicity of the food being served. this was my experience at mint indian cuisine today. i gave the restaurant a fourstar rating for the number of options available on the lunch buffet, the flavor and quality of the food, and the overall customer experience. i was very pleased as well at the number of vegetarian and vegan options on the buffet.the food was tasty, the staff friendly and helpful and the price reasonable. while the 11.99 price tag is a little higher than id like, the variety of options and quantity of food make it a decent value. if i can have three different flavors for a tad more than id pay for one in a nonbuffet setting, i see that as a good deal. i dont see much difference from my previous visits when the restaurant was under a different name, other than the extremely friendly gentleman that greeted me, showed me the buffet and gave me a seat at the bar.
i love this indian place. my family and i come here many sunday nights and the food is great, one of the best indian places in all of az. there are many vegetarian options and i always have options of what to order. the restaurant recently underwent new ownership but our favorite waiter sam kojak is back. he is an especially good waiter and has so much energy. under the new management, the plates, silverware, and napkins became better in quality and the food is still great. the atmosphere is nice and i always see indian families therea good sign that the food is tasty.
location: this is near shea and the 101, near lifepower yoga kind of in a strip of shopsrestaurants. parking: easy and plentiful. this looks a lot more fancier on the inside than on the outside!  the decor was appropriate and interesting, but much more classier than other indian restaurants, though a few framed pics were kind of off. service:  excellent! the server and others were constantly coming by and very helpful and friendly.  food: delicious and plentiful!  i had some red curry and ate almost all of it.  my friend had some kind of lamb; when we left, the server offered some rice with her togo food.
decent classic breakfast 6.99. english muffin cooked perfectly not burned, bacon was a little fatty for my tastes, eggs cooked to order and hash browns were tasty. no complaints friendly and courteous staff.
good breakfast, good food, good price.  great menu selection. staff prompt  courteous. we ordered classic breakfasts but i was curious about their chorizo so i asked to taste a little...the waitress explained to the cooks  they sent out a small chorizo patty  and we were pleasantly surprised. not fatty or too spicy...good flavor. hash browns are freshly cut. next time will order the mexican benedict. heard the owner say shes trying to offer different menu selections. there are options for the weighthealth conscious too. will definitely be a regular! place is clean, newly remodeled, which is a big plus!
my brother and i just had lunch there. fast friendly service. had the mushroom swiss burger and substituted salad for usual fries. the burger was great, but the salad could have used a better dressing. the burger and a drink or just over 11 bucks.
great place for a late breakfast! nice to see a mixed type of clientele. love the corned beef hash! its hard to find a place that uses the canned kind. ill keep coming back just for that!sometimes the service is slow but its a fine time to catch up on life. so sit back, enjoy your meal, look out of the window. and....you sometimes get free icecream!!!!!
clean place, super service thank you, penny!, enormous quantities of tasty food. love the new look and menu. close to home so we will definitely be back.
service deserves a 5 star! our server was an older woman and was on top of it! coffee was refilled, checkins were timed appropriately and knowledgable with the menu and gave us options with salsas. the portions were perfect for the prices that we paid, and the taste was actually pretty good! i have to say that i preferred their potatoes over matts big breakfast because they were toasted evenly throughout not burnt on one side  they could have been seasoned more but regardless, they were good. the eggs were cooked perfectly and they tasted like real eggs, the hashbrowns were plentiful and again a decent sized portion. i had the belgian waffle and my husband had the pancakes both were good  weve had better but they were decent. for it being a last minute decision we were very happy with this restaurant for breakfast. it definitely felt like the neighborhood restaurant  homely feel. :
first time back since this was fast eddies. nice refreshed look but used to enjoy all the vintage signs. no complaints about the food or service. raven waited on us. great personality. apologized that our food took a little longer than usual. english muffins were hot out of the toaster. yeah! looking forward to our next trip.
this place was an awesome family run restaurant! our waitress raven was great! we will come back next time we are in the area!
great place i had great service both times i had  better service the first time i was there although last time i came close to closing. food great both times gyro skillet fabulous and irish eggs benedict was  also fabulous. free ice cream with your meal served after 11 am which is pretty cool.
it is a nice new spot. went for breakfast with a girlfriend and we both had the country breakfast which was great! the eggs were a little under cooked but that was okay. the menu is a little overwhelming but the server was friendly and the place was clean. i definitely recommend it!
sweet! so the choices are as follows:1 go visit the brewery2 let the brass tap do all the footwork for you70 taps! are you kidding?! no, apparently they arent...just opened and the place was packed to capacity!noda, ass clown, d9, unknown, sugar creek, sycamore and omb all in one place! skip the brew tour bus and just sit at the bar!!!super cool and friendly staff will hook you up pronto! great bar food, outdoor space and atmosphere!! wonderful addition to south end!!
the fella and i visited on a wednesday since it was halfoff wine night, and it turns out it was also trivia night starts at 7:00. parking was a little tricky when we got there at 4:45, and based on how crowded it was when we left, im guessing it got downright hairy!the inside is really cool  dark wood for coziness but high ceiling skylights for openness and light. the bar is long with a bajillion taps mostly local  noda, sugar creek, sycamore, unknown, d9, etc., and theres a covered patio, too. we sat inside and got friendly, consistent service. i had a couple of glasses of wine, and the fella got a few draft beers. their bottle list was interesting, but some of the prices were insane... stick with the tap list!we split a combo appetizer 13.99, which came with pork pot stickers, eggrolls, and tempura shrimp, and tempura chicken tenders 5.99, which we had seen come out to other people and looked delicious. everything was really good. i dont usually have high standards for bar food, but it wasnt greasy or heavy, and the dipping sauces were pretty delicious, especially the sweet chili sauce.
so many brass taps!  glad this place is open and a nice addition to the southend places to hang out.  right off of summit, there are places to park for 1440 s tryon building or a short walk from the bland street lynx station  just be careful crossing tryon at the weird intersection where it splits into camden, but there are proper crosswalks and just be patient with the lights at the intersection.  car vs. walker is never a good situation for the walker.walk in... no hostess table, sit where you like.... lots of places at the bar and someone is taking your order.  this place has a ton of beers on draft and a large bottle selection...  if you cant find something to drink here there is probably something wrong with ya.  pretty extensive menu for eats as well.  lots of shareables or appetizersbar food.this place is a chain from florida? but its not a bad thing.  i like what ive experienced so far.  it feels like a stand alone place and a great addition to the charlotte scene.
what a great addition to south end...! ive been here about 5 or 6 times now and this place just keeps getting better and better. yes, first couple of times service was a bit slow and drinks took a little long to come out, but in their defense i was here on the 2nd and 3rd night that they were open.the following time i came in was for the uswnt game vs germany. i called ahead and the manager was nice enough to reserve a table for me since i was coming with a big group. they were slammed that night! people everywhere  even with all the craziness going on service was solid and we all got our food within a reasonable amount of time. i have now tried 9 or 10 things on their menu and i have not eating anything that hasnt been good! the pizzas and flat breads are all very tasty  the burgers are excellent  and their peri peri wings are fantastic ask for them well done, trust me!along with all the tasty food they have a shit tone of beers on tap, tons of tvs, games, and a great outdoor patio. i cant wait for football season so i can make this one of my go to spots to catch some games. come check this place out  it wont dissapoint!
ive been in twice and really enjoyed myself both times...  it was a little smaller than i expected, but theres good seat placement, so you dont feel like youre tripping over people or anything... the service was absolutely fabulous the first time and relatively decent the second, so im giving them a solid star for that...i know the main draw to a place like this is the brass taps, but ive actually enjoyed both of my food items more than the drinks ive had...  i thought the biermosa was good, but the guinness bacon waffles were delicious... and dont get me started on that sausage gravy... good grief, that was yummy...the next time, i cant even remember the beer that i ordered, but it was some type of pilsner... the florentine panini was out of sight, though... it was kind of like having spinach artichoke dip on a sandwich... and their home fries are the diced potatoes kind...  both times, they were piping hot and had the perfect crisp on the outside... it might be a little pricey, but the amount of food kind of makes up for it in my book... i was stuffed after the waffles and could only finish one side of my sandwich, so i was very happy.  ill definitely be back to tap that.
their assortment of local taps is great and their food was very good. i just wish the space was a little larger as quarters got quite right as the night crawled on.
right near my place so im a little biased but the food is stellar, only complaint is that the portions are on the smaller side. staff has talent and uniform yoga pants but they can be a little on the slower. ill give it a break since its new. overall great experience and a nice place to have a meal and begin a day of serious drinking. 4 stars awarded.
every time i come here, i sing brass monkey to myself the entire walk from my car to the door. and also sometimes in the bathroom. rip mca. i dont see how you cant like this place. beer. bottles and drafts. a ton of it. all of it. changing taps with the seasons and what not. i mean, i got an adult root beer float. do i really need to say anything else? thats right, not your fathers rb on draft the last two times ive been here. warning: drink your float quickly or it will overflow. dont like beer? they have cocktails and wine as well. our good friend billy m wanted two things for his birthday: dinner and great beer. so, we came here on a thursday night. nailed it. our server was fantastic. we had people coming in and out joining us. he never skipped a beat. seriously, if this guy isnt employee of the month then hes getting robbed. i ordered the prime rib sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. note: the mac n cheese has bacon and green onions on top. oh, and its freaking delicious that way. billy got a pizza with pretzel crust. oh yes, pretzel crust. our table also did pretzel bites, spin dip, bacon cheeseburger flatbread, an all american burger, and the buffalo chicken wrap. another side item note: they have waffle fries. everyone really liked their food. i devoured my entire sandwich, poor thing didnt stand a chance. theres a good amount of tvs for all your sporting needs. the patio is a pretty good size and they use heaters when its cold. a ton of great specials throughout the week, including happy hour food specials. two dollar tacos on tuesdays. boofreakingyah. spoiler alert: they are really good. my favorite is the fist because i love peppadew peppers. you can get a couple tacos and a margarita for less than 10. tuesdays are also game night, trivia on wednesdays. until next time brass tap, brass monkey, that funky monkey. brass monkey junkie. that funky monkey....
caprese sandwhich and an iced tea! yummy! clean atmosphere, friendly staff. a great lunch spot if youre staying at ny ny!
my favorite lunch spot. cant afford to eat here all the time cause i do ayce but love it when i can. staff is always very friendly. would be nice if they had two chefs at a time but they make due with the one they have.
no matter the name, always had good, friendly service and good food.  i love that we can get a bento style meal any time of the day, for a reasonable price.
really good sushi: very quick service. i came at 4:30 as my husband  had an evening flight to catch. poke tuna was tasty. the cut of tuna was too large but still good and they do baked scallop rolls!
ive been coming here since it was tokyoto sushi. menu and people are the same. still one of my fave sushi spots. we never do ayce, so the a la cart menu is awesome. love the heart attack i roll!
service and food was wonderful. restuarant and sushi bar area super clean and comfortable.  hung out with some friends and ordered all you can eat. they were open to accommodate pretty much all our requests as it was first time in not knowing all of their roll names etc.  everything was really fresh and tasty. drinks were kept typed off and we were never rushed with any of the orders. the pace in which each came out was almost like they were paying great attention to the pace of our enjoying and completing reach sushi or roll plate. would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys casual and none rushed sushi meals.
o my sushi was really good. i like the cucumber wrapped rolls and the johnny roll was the best ive had. the baked mountain roll had really good flavor. the service was great. great food for a great price.
wanted some lunch after a doctors appointment.  wasnt hungry enough to do the all you can eat so i ordered the sashimi lunch included miso soup.  nice quality fish.  clean and quiet atmosphere.  staff is friendly and accommodating.
the sushi is amazing and the staff are very welcoming and friendly! the service and setting of the restaurant is also great. overall, a pretty good sushi restaurant.
if you in summerlin and like sushi you have to try it out! this place is great! such a comfortable setting and the sushi is delicious! the lion king, titanic and crunchy roll is my favorite. price is perfect for the food and service you get.
ive been here a couple times and have enjoyed it. the people are friendly, the service is quick. the all you can eat portion sizes are perfect. you can sample a variety of rolls appetizers, etc. my favorite roll is the o.m.g roll. the spice and acidity of the roll was in perfect combination with the sweet and savory flavor. cute atmosphere too!
im typically not a big fan of ayce sushi because i feel like its always really hard to find a place where the price and quality makes it worth it but i was very pleased with omy sushi. im not from vegas and have doubts about how fresh fish is when vegas is a desert but the quality was pretty good. my boyfriend and i came at 3pm and paid the dinner price 24.95person. we sat at the bar and got great service. we ordered a lot of their nigiri, as well as a few specialty rolls, and then i ended the meal with mochi which was also included in ayce. i really liked the garlic yellowtail and the cajun albacore sushi.memorable dishes that id recommend are: rolley rice tuna tataki johnny roll scallop lover
found a dime in the ayce venue of sushi work in vegas. theyre popping up everywhere but normally ayce is subjected to lackluster pieces of sushi. this place serves good portions and awesome creations as well as some staples. only reason not a five star rating is speed and accuracy. few of our orders didnt go thru but not a big deal. definitely going back
came here on a little sushi date with my sister. service was excellent and the food was good. it is very quiet and cozy. i recommend the green tea ice cream
so far so good. 2nd time come and brought friends. so happy we found a place closer to home literally 4 min away .
this place is changing, work underway for remodel. getting new chairs, carpet, concessions and resevre seats. during all these changes, prices seem to be reasonable. weve been in the upgraded theaters already, seats are wide, recline and are spread out, theater doesnt seem crowded. glad to see these upgrades, its worth our time and close to our hood so we will certainly take advantage, we dont mind the drive across town to green valley, but this gives us options!
remodel forces updated review!wow!  the crappy seats have been removed and replaced with recliners!  this is awesome!  just saw the second avengers here in reclining comfort!  for regular pricing too!now the bad part of the remodel that others may find a plus. snacks are now served where you get your own butter for your popcorn and pour your own drinks.  i personally dont like this because i usually get something sticky on me.  if i am paying 4.50 for a soda, the least you can do is pour it for me.  but!  others will enjoy the fact that they put in those soda machines with a billion flavors to choose from and the ability to control your own ice and soda ratios.  there is still a little remodeling going on but overall they really improved this places appeal!
amazing with the new changes and mil discount after 4pm. once the bathrooms are finished 5 stars plus
reclining chairs need i say more? the movie theatre has gone under a lot of changes and for the better i may say! the prices are still cheap so it makes it even better!
im in love with the new seats! prices are still reasonable and its clean! no bed bugs in here for the next 10 years ;reasonable prices and staff is always friendly.ive been going to this theater for 2 years now and love it! it is our go to theater!
coming here for years due to the best prices ive seen for a theater even before the remodeling process since i still remember when it was a regal theater. now that amc has taken over business they have really expanded and upgraded each theater room, bathrooms, concession, and have kept their prices relatively the same. my favorite part is that they have recliners in the rooms which are beyond comfortable, and has incremented business for this location!the downside is that they have added reserved seating on select rooms and sometimes you find people on your seat, and its not enforced too strictly. other than that, this will be my to go theatre from now on in las vegas, plus its super convenient!
this was my preferred theater before the remodel, due to location and pricing. plus it was never too busy. now, postremodel, i like it even more! the squashy reclining chairs allow for less seats per auditorium and a slightly higher ticket price, but an all around more comfortable experience. i just hope other patrons take care of them so this place continues to be nice.over two recent visits though, i have noticed that service is no longer their strong suit they seem to have hired several new employees, yet only a couple are trained for box office, resulting in large lines outside with typically only one person on register. luckily, they have outdoor kiosks to expedite things poke some buttons, swipe your card, skip the line!
new recliners are great,  not so great website to buy tickets from.  always have an issue buying tickets online,  and by the time you get there seats sell out fast.  be sure to show up on time or someone will be in your seat.  the soda machines are great,  i love freestyle. theres a new bar too, if thats your thing
not bad at all...not quite as luxurious as the galaxyluxurytheatres; no beer or gourmet hot dogs but it will do in a pinch. good move wthe drinks
the remodeling of the theater was the best thing ever! the seats are far more comfortable and they have also added a bar, so you could have a crib while watching a movie. the prices are not too shabby either!
love this theater because its close to my house, but mostly love it because they have the best butter and popcorn ever!!!!  i hate to say it tho, because of the self serve drinks, its getting really run down and dirty in the drink area!
new reclining chairs that allow me to get close with someone or put them on time out, a bar and an icee machine at my beck and call. im pretty stocked about the improvements at this theater. sometimes the employees are kind of slow and i rarely ever see a manager there? overall, good experience.
there is reserved seating at this theater. the seats are very nice, comfortable, and they recline. you can also lift the arm on the chair if you wanna get snuggly with someone. food prices were high like any other theater. but they did have unlimited self serve refills. i will be going back on my next movie outing.
i love the new trend in luxury theaters.  this is how all theaters need to be in the future.  if this amc had better food choices it would be the best.  tickets are still very cheap. i think we pay about 4.50ish a person for a matinee. new screens chairs and better sound system.
great ticket prices and a coke freestyle machine help this theater set itself apart from others in the area. the place was recently remodeled with better seats too. its trying to be a premium theater like the galaxy at the cannery, but its not on the same level. the sound system isnt as good and the reclining seats are a lower quality than other premium theaters, but the ticket prices are definitely better. if you want the premium experience at a lower price this is the theater for you.
cheap movie, a bit of a distance from the strip but worth it for the drive. i like that the seats are recliners and it is reserved seating. i dont think it is as clean as other amcs, since there were popcorn and other stuff on the floor. i realized it is cheaper here versus other theaters in los angeles so that was kind of nice. i dont usually venture to go watch a movie when im in vegas but i wanted to watch star wars so this was the perfect venue.
im reluctant to release this review but it looks like some have already let the cat out of the bag about rainbow promenade 10.  i am diggin this remodel with the motorized plush recliners with foot rest.  this is best thing to happen to theaters since popped popcorn.  the chairs are sooo comfortable it was hard not to spend my entire day off work just lounging in this chair.  now if i only had a remote control and a beer.  wait they do serve beer in the concession area and some damn good ones like stone ipa! never thought i would see the day now it becomes clear why the small popcorn is 6.00.  for that price i could buy a popcorn farm.  that is just ridiculous what the prices of movie theater snacks are these days.  i think i will sneak my own in my ladies purse along with a 6 pack of brews.  it is nice to have the options in case you forget. i have never been a big movie goer but i might start because of amc promenade.  only because of the big comfy couch like seating. you gotta try this!
this review is for the service dept only.ended up rolling over on a saturday after dad broke the window motor on my passenger side.  joe took the car in and had them do a somethingsomething inspection and i wandered off through the rows of new cars to await the news.  about 20 mins later he tracked me down to confirm the bad motor and asked if id never noticed the violent shaking my car does pretty much all the time.  i might have ... but lets not place blame and move along with this transaction.  so, yeah, engine mounts  ok, i didnt know those were a thing till a few months ago when a coworker had his done.  accounts for that violent shaking you say?  well thats not good.  we should probably fix that.so we worked out a price we were both agreeable to for the motor and engine mounts, and off i went to mustang sallys for a late breakfast joe offered a shuttle to wherever i wanted to go but i decided to pass and just wait it out over breakfast.  right about the time it took me to finish my french toast i got a call from joe that everything was done  i expected a much longer wait so i was pleasantly surprised that it was so quick.  i couldnt believe the difference the engine mounts made.  who knew?  and they threw in a free car wash which was nice.so the short of it is i love joe  he took great care of me and his customer service skills are top notch.  the service guys seem to have done a good job on the work they did too.now looking at yelp i can tell tim the only 5 star review left who works for the dealer  confirmed by alans review that mentions tim by name  is someone who should avoid my path if they want to keep me as a customer.  i think its shady as hell to review your own workplace and shows a raging lack of ethics on his part.so yeah, i feel comfortable recommending joe, but the others ... proceed with caution.
came to this place on their grand opening, and the experience was a little subpar. i walked in and the place was empty. i proceeded to walk over to the register and place my order. the food menu extends to about 15 items or so which provides a healthy variety. i placed my order which consisted of a four season double, and a regular sized soft drink. i then waited for almost 25 minutes which i felt was a little lengthy considering there was nobody in the place, however the pies are made fresh when ordered so a little leeway should be granted. food quality is okay, i didnt care for the taste of the four season, but i felt the price was in line with the amount of food you get. my total bill came to  roughly 11, but keep in mind that was with a15 student discount. other than the time i waited for the food, the service was great. the staff checked on me several times while i ate. i will be giving this place another opportunity for a service recovery for the time i waited.
good food at a very good price. nothing fancy, no bells and whistles. just fresh ingredients and good, thinner crust pizzas. unlv campus needed a traditional pizza place with good prices. and they deliver on campus. for a special treat, try the persian donut. it was super tasty, not too heavy or sweet, but perfect satisfaction to the sweet tooth.
this place is great!  friendly staff, good food, decent prices.  only downgrade is they are only open limited hours.  worth the trip though.i have been meaning to go here for some time, but they have limited hours, and are not open when im usually in the neighborhood.  im glad i finally got a chance to stop by.  as has been mentioned they have persian influenced food.  i had the farsie roll.  it was a mix of meat rolled in pizza dough.  it was simply amazing.  they have many different pizza options as well, all of which sounded great.  they also have a lunch special, and the day i came it was fairly busy with unlv students.  the best part about this place though has to be the funnel cake fries!  oh wow, these are delicious!  they have several options of toppings and my order with caramel was not just top coated, but drizzled throughout with sweet caramel deliciousness.  if you find yourself near unlv afternoonearly evening, this place is worth a try!
interesting italian cafe sitting just outside place de castelnau east of stdenishere, youll find classic italian but with that modern twist you usually find in indie shops like for example, having a choice of milk and not just whole milk which is an italian cafe staple.the coffee is italian, has that very italian flavor profile. it is satisfying but i find it to be somewhat lacking. its on the thinner side, watery if you could say. it doesnt mean its no good, i just like my coffee to be fuller in the mouth.other than coffee, youll find the classic italian baked goods, homemade sandwiches as well as pizza including the breakfast one and some grocery items you can buy.seating is a bit limited but theres enough to linger around and do some work. they have wifi as well as plenty outlets. and like most italian cafes, they close pretty late.while i do have my favorite italian cafes nearby, ferlucci is a welcomed addition to that part of villeray
i was excited to try this place after reading about its opening on eater and chef charles antoines new project.  i was able to make reservations online at 9pm and it was still packed when we arrived.the set up had a few communal tables and  a dessert table on display which had that country feel as well as some booths and tables for 2 and 4 if you wanted a more intimate setting.  friday was definitely packed with a mix of older groups and younger couples.  its definitely a loud atmosphere and in the beginning of our meal, it was interesting they were playing electronica music that was a bit too loud to hold a conversation but eventually the music died down towards around 10pm.my friend and i started out with glasses of wine however, there were definitely bottles to be purchased. we ordered three courses and as we waited for our dishes we were served with bread and butter.the plates were definitely about art and presentation which makes it more fun. the most memorable dish was the broccoli on cob.  the dish was huge but eating it was fulfilling even though its considered a light dish.they still need to iron out a few kinks since we waited a long time for the last two dishes. they both came out at the same time so it felt rather rushed.  if the dishes were spaced out evenly in between, i felt it would have been a flawless execution.  well see what they will have in store in their 6 month and one year mark.  i am looking forward to more innovative surprises at montreal plaza
so good! jackie was our waitress and she was super friendly and attentive!we shared the stake tartare, red velvet chicken  waffles, street corn, and smores.the street corn was my favorite. the fatty in me wishes the waffles came with syrup. the tartare was good but not memorable, and the smores were the perfect ending to the meal.i also tried the mango and lychee sangria. perfectly sweetened and strong from the grand mariner. i would definitely pick this spot again for something to snack on downtown!
went in for a dinner tonight with my sister based on an article in a local magazine, our desire to try a new spot in town, and my knowledge of chef daniel ontiveros and his super skills. was able to make a reservation in the afternoon and were seated right away even though we showed up a bit early. the build out is extremely well done. one of the best new projects ive seen in the revitalization of downtown. trendy but still really comfortable. our amazing server, kyrsten, was helpful and answered all of our questions, making some recommendations but giving us plenty of time to talk out the menu and make up our minds. we liked a number of items on the menu and decided to do a tapas style share of everything we ordered and kyrsten was super accommodating about it. we had the oxtail empanadas, fire roasted corn, in the gnudi ricotta bites, and shrimp scampi. as 3 of our 4 choices were apps or from the social or meant to be shared portion of the menu, kyrsten suggested we space them out so they didnt all arrive at once which we appreciated. the oxtail had great flavor and the wrappers were fried just rightnot too hard or chewy. the corn was charred perfectly and though my sister requested to have the corn shaved off the cob and was told the kitchen wouldnt do itit was so good she wasnt upset at having to eat it off the cob. the gnudi was ahhmazing. its a lighter and much more flavorful cousin to a gnocchi with a sauce that chef daniel outdid himself with! just the right amount of sweet and savory all in one bite! we finished the meal sharing the smoresim not a fan of smores in general but wanted to taste everything. i made my sister give me my full half! its sooo good! real marshmallowsnot fluff, not bagged, but real, im assuming inhouse homemade marshmallows browned to a satisfying crunch on top of a rich chocolate layer and a graham crumble. yum!!  i would recommend coming down just to sit at the bar and have a late night dessert and drink if the rest of the sweets are as good as that one. i will say that i feel that the  price per person rating does not reflect a full dining experience here. unless you only come in and have a non alcoholic drink and a sandwichburger expect to pay more than 20 bucks a person. our 4 shared plates tonight with no booze on our tab was 68 before tax and gratuity. im a local born and bred and have worked in the food industry for years so i have no problem paying for good food; just be prepared that you can easily drop 100 on a two person tab in this place. if there were any kinks or hiccups in their opening week or so, i believe theyve worked them out because we experienced no issues. i fully enjoyed my first visit to therapy and will return and recommend it to friends and visitors alike.
joining a growing list of dtlv eateries, therapy. has some inventive dishes and new takes on others.  items served:oxtail empanadas with lime creme fraichesoft pretzel bread with spicy beer mustardin the gnudiroasted mexican street cornassorted mushroom flatbread with smoked bacon, caramelized onion and soft cooked eggred velvet waffle slidershangar steak tartarcrispy fried pig ears with truffle honey mustard sauceroasted cauliflower with dates and yellow currycast iron smores with semisweet chocolate and bacon marshmallowscrumbled carrot cakegreeted by the general manager, chuck scimeca, we were quickly seated and brought water and i ordered an iced tea.  we were asked if we wanted to order items from the menu or have the chef send out items he chose.  after looking at the menu, we opted for them to make the choices for us but we had a few requestsitems they had already planned for us to have.  during our dinner, chef daniel ontiveros, formerly at comme ca, came to the table to talk about some of the dishes and his plans for the menu in the future.  i saw him several times stopping at tables to chat with customers.outstanding dishes were the gnudibaked ricotta, truffle honey, fig jam, roasted almonds  cranberry and walnut crostini.  the jam and almonds with the baked cheese on the crostini was excellent!  the mexican street corn was very good.  ill go for this anytime.  the assorted mushroom flatbread was very different.  instead of being a standard flatbread crust, it was instead a puff pastry crust.  the char on the pastry was perfect without being burnt.  the soft cooked egg mixed onto the flatbread added to the flavor of the mushrooms and bacon.  the last two items were ones we asked for and were good choices.  the baked cauliflower with china ranch dates and yellow curry was excellent!  the light curry flavor was very good.  finally, the pig ears were so much different than others ive had.  these were meatier instead of being a thin slice of pig ear.  the honey mustard dipping sauce with them was very tasty.the two desserts were quite good.  the smores with bacon marshmallows on top of a graham cracker crust in the cast iron container was a fun disha perfect example of chef ontiveross slant on a dish thats available in area restaurantsthis with a very different twist.  the favorite, however, was the crumbled carrot cake served with cream cheese frosting and a spoon of vanilla ice cream.service during the evening was excellent.  my iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass before i  was done with the previous and the servers were all pleasant and efficient.  one negative for methe music was loud at times and it almost overwhelmed our conversation.  therapy. is very close to being a five star review. we were not presented a check.  the servers were taken care of instead.therapy. has been open for just over a month and things are running very smoothly.  it was with a very full stomach that we walked back to the garage where wed parked.  ill be back to therapy. soon!
recently opened in the whitehot fremont east district, an interesting decision given the established gastropub offerings of park, glutton, carson kitchen and more, it was at the suggestion of two trusted palates that dinner at therapy. was booked, the menu seemingly featuring all the right words with execution left to chef daniel ontiveros in his debut role as head toque in a restaurant off the strip.long in layout and twostories tall, the space formerly inhabited by a dollar store completely renovated with a sexy bar and exposed ceilings as an open kitchen operates towards the back, it was at the hostess stand that we met the gm and swiftly led to a tidy fourtop at the center of the restaurant the option of dining a la carte or letting the chef cook for the table was offered, the later obviously accepted with a few special requests.admittedly allowing a friend of the house to arrange the reservation, and unexpectedly presented with no check at nights end, it was with service proving not only friendly but exceedingly wellinformed and efficient that the meal began; a plate of soft pretzels set beside a quartet of oxtail empanadas, the former unequivocally buttery and luscious while the latter found surprising levity when dipped in peppery creme fraiche.sipping a stiff yet fruity frozen drink, and later treated to a tasting of signature sangrias from which the eldermelon iteration proved an onpoint summer refresher, it was with good pacing that round two arrived a few minutes after opening plates were finished and although the citrus kissed street corn was certainly no slouch there is little sense arguing that the star of the show was in fact the absolutely irresistible ricotta dumplings entitled in the gnudi, a gooey bite both sweet and savory that wows equally when eaten like gnocchi or spread on crostini, an item already rivaling the best appetizers in the city and a midpoint contender for the years ten best bites.at this point seeing lights lowered as a popheavy soundtrack switched to taylor swift at a volume that seemed a bit unnecessary given the growing din of the crowd, it was onward to a flaky puffpastry flatbread topped with mushrooms and a softpoached egg that the savories marched on, and with a shocking degree of smoke imbued in the crust given the use of an electric oven each slice was slowly savored, a followup jar of silky steak tartar on par with what should be expected while the whimsical redvelvet sliders were unfortunately a bit muddled by all the accoutrements, a bit less slaw or more brine to the bird needed to add balance while the bun would have been better off crisp.at this point a bit full, but unable to resist tasting a few more savories before moving onto dessert, it was with good fortune that a request was made to sample the meatiest pigs ears tasted to date, and yet as delicious as the indulgent strips were it was perhaps a bit of a surprise that the charred yellow cauliflower presented even bolder, the use of curry, dates, as well as nuts offering a great degree of balance and giving one hope of great things to come when ontiveros launches a marketdriven blackboard in the months to come.told that sweets at therapy. are something not to be missed it was after a short visit from the chef that the meal would reach its end, and again treated to a duo one would be hard pressed to decide whether the cast iron smores or deconstructed carrot cake was better, each creamy spoonful of the first exceptionally decadent despite being nicely anchored by a graham cracker base while the crumbled semicircle of spice cake was unquestionably more elegant, each bite offering something slightly different when paired to ice cream and airy cream cheese.still new, but already executing at a high level from the kitchen to the front of house staff, therapy. marks yet another success for east fremont, an area where things may indeed seem samesame on the surface, while a deeper shows chefs like ontiveros instead pushing new concepts in an attempt to evolve the scene, and perhaps even swing the pendulum away from the strip and thereby change the game.
went there on a monday night with a party of eight.  had a bunch of apps to start.  our favorite was the gnuudi sp?..hands down.  the popcorn was a disappointment for 7..way to small of a portion.  empanadas were average.  steak tar tar was outstanding and all the flavors meshed well together.  mac and cheese was also a hit.  in all, the appetizers were solid but the portions were too small for the price.draft beers  not sure if it was me but the draft beer glasses looked to be a 12 oz pour and should be 16oz pints.  also the wine and cocktails pours looked short..mgmt please review.  strip maybe can get away with this but not downtown.entrees were spot on.  i had the best kale salad ever, and im normally not a kale salad fan.  the char took it to another level.  everyone else at the table was pleased with their entrees.  burger, french dip, flat bread, and caesar salad from what i rememberdesserts were to die for.  had the smores and the carrot cake which the server talked us into.  so glad she did because its not your typical carrot cake...much better and executed.the service was perfect and the staff was always there if you needed anything without being intrusive.nice addition to the dtlv dining scene.
great food and environment. went there on saturday when dj toxic is playing. absolutely great music. love the place.
its just bar food, but good bar food. there are many options in vegas for an upscale bar food experience, but sadly most of these spots fall pretty short when it comes to delivery. therapy isnt reinventing the wheel here, but they are making a better, tastier, and more attractive place to hang with friends. the location is great, smack dab in the middle of a bustling downtown las vegas great for both tourist and locals alike. i came here after attending the las vegas film festival and instantly loved the decor and flow of this place. there are no walls in the place, you can literally see into the bar, kitchen, and upstairs dining area from anywhere on the lower level. my guest and i werent super hungry so we went with a smattering shareable food items found on the, social club menu section. the oxtail empanadas, the chicken meatballs, roasted curry cauliflower and mixed mushroom flatbread. from the best to the not so best... the oxtail empanadas, our server georgie suggested these amazing little pockets of tender meat. lite crispy pouches filled to the brim with slowed cooked shredded meat, a must order! thanks georgie! the mixed mushroom flatbread. mushrooms, truffle oil, cheese, all on flattened puff pastry. this was a little heavy on the truffle oil, but was still very tasty. i really enjoyed the bacon cut into cubes rather than diced strips. comes with a soft boiled egg for all that runny goodness! roasted cauliflower. solid curry flavor especially when paired with dates. cooked perfect with a light snap as you bit into them. the chicken meatballs were just ok. they were a tad bland and dry, so thank goodness it came with a cilantro pesto. i pretty much had to drown the meatball in this tasty sauce. this might be a onetime thing so maybe ill try this on my next visit. this place is definitely worth a try even if you just pop in for a quick cocktail and snack.
amazingly renovated space. youll never believe this place in dtlv used to be a minimart! the inside certainly has that wow factor, and the soft, cushy seats are a huge plus.i ordered the the french dip, which came out on a grilled hoagie roll  which gave it a crisp bite, but enough softinsides to be good for soaking up au jus. the only thing i did not like about the french dip was the au jus served alongside it. it was much more gravylike than au jus, so the bread didnt soak it up very well. when i think of a french dip, i want regular au jus to soak into the bread, not just a dipping sauce. however, i have to admit the gravy had great, deep flavor, and the meat inside the sandwich was succulent, with very little fat. chips came with the sandwich, and were crunchy, salty, and tasty.overall i was impressed at their lunch offerings. i would certainly go back. prices are a little on the high side especially for lunch, but the food is quality.
my anxiety can only be cured by food. what better place to get that taken care of that than therapy. the diners are your typical local downtown hipsters. the service was good.the decription of menu items seemed all so delicious. we gave a few items a try...in the gnudi:fig jam, baked ricotta, truffle honey, roasted almonds, arugula on cranberry walnut crostini. they look like takoyaki with grilled bread on the side. different textures and flavors in a simple dish. sweetness from the fig jam and honey, the peppery taste from the arugula, the smokey flavor from the grilled crostini, the mild taste and creaminess from the ricotta, and the crunch from the almonds. 45oxtail empanadas:empanadas filled with oxtail with lime creme fraiche. split the empanada in half to release the steam from the hot and juicy oxtail pieces then dip in creme fraiche. i just wish there was more of the tasty filling. 3.55chicken and red velvet waffle slider:crispy chicken breast with a red pepper remoulade in between red velvet belgian waffles, with syrup on the side. the chicken itself was nice and crunchy without being heavy on the batter. the remoulade adds heat and tang but the sweet syrup with a hint of alcohol balances it out. i tried to eat this with my hands but the waffles werent stable enough to hold the heavy chicken and the wet remoulade. definitely eat with a fork and knife. 45the french dip:roasted prime beef, horseradish cream on a grilled hoagie with truffle chips on the side. i havent had a good beef sandwich in this country since i moved out of the midwest. the jus is more like a gravy as its thicker than your average jus but honestly, you wont even need it. the truffle chips were amazing. they werent oily and they were freshlymade. they definitely taste like truffles. 55i wanted to give the roasted jidori chicken, shrimp scampi, and filet frites a try but i guess i would have to come back for more therapy.
went in on a tuesday with my husband after work for a nightcap and some dinner and was pleasantly surprised!  our bartender shannon offered great suggestions for dinner and was very knowledgable about the beer options. we tried several items and liked the sexy burger the best! we also tried oxtail empanadas that were delicious.  i had two cocktails that were very tasty and hubby was happy with his beers although the bottles were a little pricey. we will be back!
super fun! super tasty new downtown spot! we had a blast here.we had kirsten for our server, and she so great! we felt like we were visiting a friend we had not seen for a while!we sat down and saw so many yummy things on the menu we decided to order a bunch of small family style plates form the social club section of the menu.here are my quick hits on food.... oxtail empanadas  loved them! the sauce had some delicious creamy heat!roasted cauliflower  the dates were the best part, the cauliflower was fine but a tiny bit blah in the flavor department.mac  cheese  truffleliscious! it was really awesome, the smoked bacon was a great add.street corn  i loved it! a bit too citrusy for other peeps on the table, so i ate theirs! yum!gnudi  very tasty!we all decided we would happily go back any time! the dining room is sexy and comfortable, the food is truly social!
cool new restaurant.  nice find downtown.  creative food and drink, industrial decor and good service.  i liked the gr8 side dishes, oxtails, corn, asparagus, organic chicken, burgers, etc.  bar is fun and hamms beer on draft.  spacious, loud and good people watching.
therapy reached out about the unpleasant service experience that we had, its always nice to know that the operators take feedback and are willing to correct issues, huge plus for that! i have no returned yet, but im confident that with someone taking corrective action that service will increase dramatically. like i had said in my review, the food was pretty good, service was the only issue.
when comparing the hot triple threat of new american eats in dtlv, therapy reluctantly gets the bronze medal by a few tenths of a point.  its still worthy, offering things the others dont, like cozier seating, a nice sized bar, and the only place on the block with big tvs for sports.  but despite a few interesting menu twists, their dishes either match similarly in quality to their competitors or fall a bit short, but never really surpass.         the crispy fried pig ears are presented like a brides bouquet at a high end redneck wedding.  this group friendly dish came a lot crispier with less breading on my most recent visit, which i felt to be not as good as my initial time; it still magically disappeared though.  the truffle honey mustard dipping sauce is kind of gross, so i just eat them straight, preferably with a large glass of hamms.  another great partner with beer is popcorn.  the fried peanuts and maple candied bacon make for wonderful companions, but sharing this with actual companions is slightly awkward since youll basically be eating bits that were touched, but unsuccessfully attempted to be picked up, by others when diving in for their handful.  i wanted chopsticks!  a bigger bowl with a mini shovel would work better.  id like a couple of hits of whatever the chef was smoking when he thought of this one.   the chicken and red velvet waffle slider is an eye catcher with all its color, but a crispier waffle would have made for a functional sandwich instead of sloppiness on a plate.  the fried chicken itself was crispy and very juicy.  i would have been down with just a bucket of that.  definitely worth returning for, but ill be eating this all deconstructed with a fork and knife next time.one dish to be avoided is the roasted cauliflower.  the extreme char masked any signs of seasoning.  that place on carson that starts with a g does an incredible version of this.  get the excellent street corn instead or save the extra bucks and room for one of therapys great desserts like carrot cake or smores.  3.7623235799213 stars.
food is great! i definitely recommend this spot especially for date night or just friends hanging out. can hardly wait to come back!
had a great dinner. great presentation and the flavors were diverse. the french dip was tasty, tender and complemented by crisp truffle chips.  street corn was excellent.  the pork chop was thick and juicy my father in law was pleased and shared bites with everyone.  the meatballs were well seasoned but a tad dry. overall it was enough to bring us back.  atmosphere was an a and service was on point.  we will come back to try the other items on the menu.
yummy yummy! great music, great vibes,  wonderful staff. the food was delish and creative. ordered the steak tar tar, mexican corn, ox tail empanadas, blt which was served on a croissant and the chicken meatballs. faves were the empanadas and the corn.
amazing tasting of appetizers, cocktails, chicken  red velvet waffles with a twist and a unique carrot cake desert to top it off. great new dtlv restaurant. walking distance from the container park. a fresh look for downtown with good lighting and high ceilings. the private loft on the 2nd floor gives it a vip feel thats perfect for a group or larger party. the bar is comfortable with a wide variety of drinks including a few frozen cocktails  try the frozen mango sangria, spa looking with fresh fruit garnish refreshing and smooth. lots of parking near by and tons of foot traffic around.
we ate there last night and had a great experience. we were originally seated by the door to the kitchen which always seems to happen to us on our anniversary. when we told the hostess her response was perfect and she immediately moved us to a different table. our waiter was great. just chatty enough and very attentive. the smash coctail with bourbon, black berries, mint, lime etc. was delicious! ordered a second. we ordered from the social menu. the beef tartar was yummy and made even better with the pickled turnips, cauliflower and pickles. we also ordered the ox tail empanadas.  the ox tail was sumptuous but i always prefer empanadas baked not fried. the baked califlower with dates and curry was like a meat dish. be sure to eat the mint with it. takes the flavor over the top. we didnt have room for dessert but they looked good too.  overall a great experience. i highly recommend this place if you are looking for hearty flavorful inventive food.
my friends and i drunkenstumbled over to this place from the nearby commonwealth, after two too many drinks or 7, who knows?.  we didnt know the kitchen was closing in five minutes, but were relieved when the server let us order anyway.we paid them a pretty penny for our late night nosh, so, good on them for recognizing the drunk hunger when its ready to fork over their charge cards.not many options for pescatarian littleme, but i made do with the delicious limecrema infused street corn and some ridic truffle fries.  my friends made me try bites of their other insanely delicious food, after picking out huge globules of bacon or pancetta.  that being said, if i were to visit this place again at a reasonable hour i would see if they could make me their truffle mac sans meat.  it would be worth the probable dirty looks from the kitchen just to try.while our tab wasnt cheap, i felt the food was delicious enough to be decent value.  id go again in a heart beat.old strip is greater than new strip.
it as our first night on fremont street.  we walked out of golden nugget and was floored by the liveliness.  we were also hungry. it was 10:30pm. neon signs everywhere adversing steak and lobster for cheap.  i wasnt convinced and pulled out yelp instead.  all the 4 star 2 places were closing in 25 min.  we almost walked into dennys and then a cheap burger joint but glad we didnt as we found therapy at the end of fremont street.  i saw the four stars in yelp and was excited to try it. we were not disappointed.  we had the french dip, juicy and delicious.  the truffle chips with it was addictive.  we ordered an extra side of it.  also got the ceasar  loved the way they did it and high quality baby romaine they used.  yum!  also ordered the oxtail empanadas.   we were so full only ended up having one.  will be a great snack. what a great find.  we sat at the bar. holly and shannon were great bartenders and the atmosphere was nice.  we ended up chatting with our neighbors and had a great time. highly recommend.  ;
drinks were good, bartenders were friendly, food was ok. prices were average to a bit high for the area, but it is a little nicer of a place than the ones directly surrounding it. i would probably not go back unless it were for a specific drink as the vibe was not all that lively and seating was like that of a tgi fridays not too comfortable or inviting.
had dinner here on a thursday night. was seated in a comfy booth right away with no wait. robert was our server and was very well versed on the menu and made great suggestions for everything. my boyfriend and i each ordered a drink and started with the bacon wrapped dates and oxtail empanadas. both were very tasty and filling. had the chicken and salmon for dinner. good sized portions but the chicken was a bit dry. salmon was very good. we didnt have room for dessert but will come back to try the carrot cake. there are other items on the menu that we look forward to trying. check was about 100 for three drinks, two appetizers, and two entrees. good atmosphere and great service. ask for robert to be your server. hes great!
i love the atmosphere. service was great! ordered:1the bacon wrapped dates2red velvet chicken sliders wmaple syrup.3 mac  cheese with bacon4 smoreseverything mentioned above are highly recommended and delicious. by far one of the best mac  cheeses i have had yet. the smores will blow your mind.  thank you, therapy for keeping my tummy happy during the life is beautiful fest!
therapy has some unique drink and food selection that cant be found at a lot of other places, such as deep fries pig ears. we also tried some street corn here which was delicious and slightly better than gluttons primarily because it was served on the cob and as a result wasnt soaked in the sauces  it made it feel less heavy.the drinks we had were somewhat a miss. i tried their much hyped smash drink and it was just ok. we also tried the mango and lychee blended drink but it was very tasteless with only a hint of alcohol.the atmosphere here is slightly nicer than the general downtown feel  its got a nice open layout and a modern look. definitely a place that one could spend some time and feel comfortable in. that being said, its a little pricier than other places nearby.
great food, especially the steak tartar and pork chops amazing!!!!!!great beer selection. cool place to celebrate your birthday
i do have to say that im torn between a 3.5 star rating or a 4 star rating when it comes to therapy. so i guess you can say its somewhere in the middle there. therapy offers a classier than your usual fremont restaurant atmosphere. it is definitely fancier and nicer looking than a lot of the restaurants you find on fremont street, especially so close to the fremont street experience area. ive been to therapy about two times now. the first time was short  we only ordered the crispy fried pig ears and the fire roasted street corn. along with those, we ordered two drinks.. the smash and the devil eyes. the pig ears were delicious. it was fried perfectly with some yummy seasoning .. it was on the saltier side of things. if you have had pig ears before, its pretty gelatinous when you eat them deep fried. the cartilage is also not as hard as they usually are. theyre pretty much melted. the fire roasted street corn was amazingly delicious. that lime aioli that goes with it is just perfect. it adds just enough of a tang to the corn. the drinks, on the other hand, was nothing to write home about. the flavors were missing and the watered down alcohol is the only thing that sticks in my memories.the second time we went, we ordered the crispy fried pig ears, the fire roasted street corn, mixed mushroom flatbread, and the big sexy. the crispy fried pig ears were a miss this time around. they were essentially burnt with no flavor. we had to get them to remake it for us and even when they remade them, it was still not as good as the first visit. it had too much batter with little to no seasoning. the fire roasted street corn was still very delicious. the mixed mushroom flatbread was amazingly delicious. the poached egg on the flatbread just brought all the flavors together in a whirlwind of tastyness. the big sexy .. the meat in the burger is very well seasoned. the tomato that they used and the brie that they used was definitely a different spin on everything. overall, it meshed in perfectly. we sat upstairs during our second visit and the service was slow. i guess no one wants to walk the stairs! haha. therapy is a good place to try some out of the ordinary food. however, the prices are a bit on the high side. four pieces of corn for 8? yeah, talk about steep for certain things that you can get for less than a dollar. nonetheless, its still a decent place just to grab a bite or two with a group of friends.
it feels barish from the outside and when you first walk in but their menu is so much more than bar food!   most of it is small plates to share but they do have a spoon  fork section on the menu that is meant to be larger portions.  upstairs is perfect for getting more of a restaurant vibe.  service was goodish and a bit offtimed.  not to the point of being awful or anything...little things like taking food order before getting drinks in, not bringing enough water glasses, refilling only when we asked, slow to clear some plates but collecting others as we were still eating off them literally and not knowing the menu.  again, it wasnt terrible....these are just some reasons its not a 5.  they were out of a few liquors so they couldnt make some of their specialty drinks.  not a deal breaker for me.   can never go wrong with vodka!the food!!!  everything was good  to delish  to awesome !   not a bad plate in the bunch.  we had chicken meatballs, roasted asparagus, mac  cheese, the meatcheese plate, steak tartare, bacon wrapped dates , the hugeporkchop, jumboshrimp scampi, mushroom flatbreadwhich is really puff pastry, squash flatbread  the ceviche  desserts....get the carrot cake.   did you hear me?  just do it....despite the description  despite the pictures that make it look like a heaping pile of mess.  i only like my mothers carrot cake so a bit of a snob.  i loved this carrot cake with its sugared nuts, dollops of icing  mixed up texture.   soooo crazy rich and huge  plan to share!   the chocolate cake was pretty but taste was meh had fridge flavor....dont waste the calories.  parking is a bit of a challenge.  el cortez is the cheapest  probably the safest.  bottom line....not a morsel left on a single plate even the meh choc cake  well definitely be back!
we are locals here part of the year here, part elsewhere.  we eat out every single day. we recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. we eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants think hanks in gvr.  it is with this in mind we write reviews.just a few steps east from the fremont experience is a delightful , small nondescript restaurant that is not to be missed .  its in an area that is redeveloping and it is a restaurant that will appeal to a more sophisticated diner, not a fremont experience guzzler who loves 1.50 hotdogs.we stopped to look at the menu and the hostess came out out to the street to greet us and induced us to give the place a try. denise, our hostess, did an excellent job of greeting us and explaining the menu in very engaging terms.a delightful restaurant, spacious, very well appointed, comfortable and with very attentive table service. and then theres the food... excellent, unusual, delicious and filling. all of the food is housemade and the flavor demonstrates that. from the appetizer through to dessert the meal is a wonderful dining experience.  the oxtail empanadas you get 4 small empanadas were different, tasty and a fine appetizer. i recently had the french dip which was excellent with tender and plentiful slices of beef and real not salty bouillon au jus filled with small pieces of beef. the truffle chips and the pepper chips are very good. the chicken fried chicken sub was delicious, with a large fried not oily chicken breast on a wonderful roll.  a very rich chocolate cake and good coffee topped off the lunch.   full bar with a very nice beer,wine and cocktail menu.  dinner service begins at 3pm.   the restaurant is wonderful for couples , business lunches and dinners and it has a loft area that can accommodate large gatherings . roger, the owner, stopped by and we had a pleasant and informative chat. our server tracy was excellent, attentive and informative without being overbearing.we commend therapy to you without hesitation.
my hubby had the sexy burger and i had the chicken meatballs. both dishes were very good. the burger was really juicy and flavorful, but a little too pink. although, the server did say it came medium rare, just next time medium would be better. anyways, the decor was nice and we really enjoyed watching college football and ufc. the tvs are in the bar area, but luckily we were seated at a table where we could see the screens perfectly. score! i cant say much about the cocktails because it was the end of the night and we just ordered coffee and water to drink, although the coffee was really good! i love a good cup of joe when im trying to sober up.i would definitely come here again.
its unfortunate that daniel ontiveros left, but if the new executive chef can lead the kitchen as well as his predecessor, therapy will continue to be a quality spot downtown and is already one of the most beautiful spaces in the area. they spent a pretty penny on this build out and the quality shows. more upscale than surrounding restaurants but still a casual environment perfect for hanging out with friends or for a date night. i stopped by a couple times earlier in the summer and both visits showcased well crafted dishes where the smaller, shareable plates shined. they have some classic dishes like steak tartare made with hangar steak and chicken and waffles using crisp and airy red velvet waffles. latin inspired dishes can be found on the menu. street corn charred and smothered with cheese, a lime aioli and a subtle kick from chili peppers makes for some good bites. as do savory, rich, and slightly oily oxtail empanadas or an order of shrimp ceviche and chips.the most successful items were also the most unique. fried pig ears were a first for me, but i walked away a fan of its crispy exterior and chewy almost like biting into a fig texture. their in the gnudi dish was also a hit. although slightly sweet with a fig jam and cranberries, spreading the baked ricotta and topping on top of the accompanying walnut crostini created an enticing array of tastes and textures.both flatbreads i tried  the summer squash and mixed mushroom flatbreads  were equally outstanding where the buttery, flakey pastrylike crust stood out as the star of both dishes.the biggest letdowns were the limp popcorn and salty and dry chicken meatballs. aside from those missteps id have to say that therapy has lots of promise, provided that the changes in the kitchen dont hold them back.
drinks and food were on point, shannon is a rockstar, drinks and small plates, highly recommend.
order those smores. do not pass them up. we were pretty stuffed with all the stuff we ordered, but one of the servers really pushed to have us order it... im glad we didnt pass.other must tries are the macaroni and cheese  it has pork belly  bacon in it. 55.the bacon wrapped dates  55. i wish it came with more though.the red velvet chicken sliders  45 . they give you two. i couldnt distinguish the red velvet waffle from the taste of a regular waffle. the bourbon maple syrup that came with is was amazing though  it tasted like it had a bit of vanilla in it too  i could be wrong....fried gator from the tailgate menu  decent. 25 .you cant really go wrong with frying things. tasted like fried chicken that wasnt dry. filet frites  ordered medium rare . 35 well cooked. i just didnt taste the truffle oil on the fries. least favorite but most expensive. vibe  semi pretentious but bearable as you get a mixed crowd with it being located on freemont street in downtown vegas.service  excellent. servers had much to say about each dish and even made recommendations. i think the manager or someone that ran the place even came out to talk to us about the food
great tvs at the bar for watching sports! alternatively, its a bit of a fancy, upscale dinner place by downtown lv standards. i really enjoy the vibe at therapy but can only vouch for the  delicious appetizers at the bar during seahawks games :
the food was amazing and such a surprise considering this restaurant is so close to fremont street. im not sure if they were understaffed at the time but our service was a little slow and we did have to wait for awhile to get our food, otherwise i would have given 5 stars. options for vegetarians here too which i really appreciated.
food was delicious!  i wish i took pictures because the presentation was very good!  we ordered a lot of food and it was all delicious!  mac and cheese was very cheesy delicious comfort food!  we also had the red velvet chicken sliders, combination of sweet and savory, made just right!  the short ribs were very tender and full of flavor, oxtail empanadas were unexpectedly good, meat was flavorful and the crust was very crispy and flaky!!  chicken balls were very good very nice pesto flavor, my favorite dish was the shrimp scampi, yummy!  lets not forget the cocktails and dessert!  all very delicious!  the sangrias are sooooo good!  desserts well, smores and chocolate were so delicious!!  cake was perfect not too sweet, just right, and the smores were perfectly and sweetly made!!  several thumbs up for therapy!!!!
my first thought when i walked in was, this place a great nice and modern with 3 tv screens to watch the game. we were seated in a timely matter. the inside is very clean. we have been here a few times for lunch with a wonderful female server and for dinner. we had the  in the gnudi, short ribs, scottish salmon, shrimp ceviche, oxtail empenadas and the summer squash flatbread. i would definitely oder the squash flatbread again and the gnudi. i am looking forward to dining here again and trying the rest of the menu.
the big sexy burger was awesome. great balance of sweet, salty and meaty. would definitely keep this place in mind. higher prices than most places around but a welcome new addition to the block.
the evp coffee shop in fitchburg recently rebranded itself as the oasis cafe to highlight a growing number of food options provided by this location.  while it still offers a full arsenal of evppowered coffee drinks, this cafe also offers a variety of wellcomposed sandwiches and, are you sitting down, pelmeni of pauls pelmeni fame.  oasis has maintained it coffeehouse roots, there are plenty of comfortable seating options, generally occupied with young professionals tapping away on their phones or laptops.  a set of large windows flood the interior with natural light and there is a small outdoor seating area for those seeking an al fresco experience.  the staff i have interacted with is top notch, uberfriendly and incredibly accommodating.the menu offers a variety of options.  in the morning, oasis serves up breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches.  from 11 am to 3 pm, the full sandwich menu is available.  during my last visit, i enjoyed their roast beef and provolone offering 8.25 with a cup of the tomato basil soup 2.  the fact this sandwich came with a healthy does of caramelized onions, pretty much assures my review will carry at least a four star rating.  the horseradish sauce needed more of an accent and less of a major flavor note.  it just overpowered the subtle flavors of the roast beef and provolone.  while i appreciated the fresh sourdough baguette, the crust provided too much resistance with each bite.  as i tried to bite off a piece, the sandwich contents would fall out the other side.  the roast beef also needed a pinch of salt to accentuate the beef flavors.i felt the dairy element of the soup muted the fresh tomato flavor.  the optional gorgonzola cheese added a needed flavor boost since the fresh basil was applied sparingly.the other food option is pauls pelmeni, which has a welldeserved cult following in madison.  while i could wax poetically about this delicacy, ill just link provide this link to pauls downtown location so you can read the glowing reviews of legions of devoted followers http:www.yelp.combizpaulspelmenimadisonsince oasis cafe is close to my office, it will definitely become a frequent lunchtime destination.
intolerable back and shoulder pain but my goto chiropractor was closed on sunday. this place is open 7 days and no appointments needed. filled out the endless paperwork and i was quickly introduced to my chiropractor, dr. altman.1015 minutes of consultation and exam to figure what was wrong, dr.altman suggested few stretch moves and tips on how to relieve the pain. then she worked her magic. after suffering from this back pain over the last couple of days, all the cracking and popping sound was music to my ears. quick as ever, i came back to life. 19 for firsttimer, but it is usually 29 for the adjustment. they also have monthly plans which is affordably priced at 49.99 and covers for 4 visits. 10 off of monthly plan if you purchase it on your first visit. affordable price and friendly staffs. i would recommend.
this is more than just a foot massage. the 1 hr massage is more like an entire body massage that gives extra emphasis on your feet. they start at your forehead and temples while your feet are soaking in warm water, then massage your feet and legs. for an additional 5 theyll scrub your feet with a sugar scrub as well. next you walk to a table in the next room and get a back, neck, leg, and butt massage. definitely worth 36 for a full hour! you receive a small bottle of water as you leave. my only complaint about this place is the size or how its set up. its not big enough for the kind of foot traffic pun intended  that they get. the chairs for the first half of the massage are in the front room as soon as you walk in and reception isnt separated in anyway. and the back rooms where the tables are located are only separated by a temporary partition. all this equates to hearing everything in the building while youre trying to relax and enjoy your massage. every time the door opens or someone speaks or coughs, youll hear it. overall, very relaxing and they do an excellent job. ive been here more than once and will definitely come back. highly recommend!
i was excited when i heard that a moroccan place was opening nearby to me, so the wife and i came in this past saturday to try it out. i had tried once before, but quickly found out that they are not open for lunch at all. hours are 410pm only on the days that they are open. anyway, we were warmly greeted and the concept and menu was explained to us in detail. i was given a small sample of the chicken dish, but ultimately decided on the spicy lamb. since i love spicy, i inquired about the spice level, which i was informed was about 2 out 5. i usually go for 5 out 5, so i was given some harissa to add to my dish to kick up the spice level when i got home. i also got a tomato and caper salad appetizer. the wife being a non meat eater chose a couscous entree called hearty veggies with chickpeas and a veggie briouat, which is a fried phyllo dough appetizer.all was expertly package for our to go order. they do have a few tables inside and outside, but it appears to mainly be a take out place. prices were reasonable and we did get plenty of food to the point of me having a very generous plate of leftovers the next day when i finished everything. overall the food was unique and had great flavor. the harissa really helped to kick up the spice level of the spicy lamb. there was one strange bite in my spicy lamb that was really intensely spicy, and i am not sure exactly what it was. i was possibly a smallish pepper, but i cant say for sure. either way, i was not expecting it, so that was the main surprise. i had a few extra drinks of water and i was fine, but i know some people that would have been hurting for a while due to them not being able to handle high spice levels. it was weird because it was only one bite, and no other repeat visit from the spicy pepper? when i ate the leftovers. for the other dishes, the wife was not a fan of the tomato and caper salad and i was less a fan of the briouat, but her couscous dish was enjoyed by both of us.all in all, a great addition to the neighborhood and i look forward to trying some other items in the future.
i saw the good reviews and decided to place a togo order. food was pretty flavorful. i got the lamb briouats for appetizer, rubbed chicken  apricot couscous and spicy lamb for entrees, and the tahini and chocolate truffles for dessert.small store, not much sitting so i bet most customers get their food togo. the staff were friendly and helpful, recommended their popular dishes since its my first time.id go back :
really good moroccan food. not open on mondays. enjoy the fresh ingredients and authentic flavor.
great choice for a delicious and convenient carry out meal! i ordered and paid ahead through my yelp! app and my food was ready to go and packed up nicely when i arrived. we tried the berber chicken the cous cous was wonderful and the veggies and sauce were as well, the chicken was tender though not a huge portion of chicken as i had imagined from other reviews. we also had the falafel hummus wrap which was different from others ive had but really delicious, i would go back and grab that for lunch for sure! we also tried the fried vegetation filled pastries from the appetizer menu, the sauce was good and the texture amazing but the taste of being fried was quite strong and detracted from some of the other flavors. overall, a great meal and we will be back for carry out on busy nights!
3 words... im going back! i like to try new food whenever i return home to charlotte, so i decided to give this place a try. the place is quaint, but a very nice place to grab a togo dinner. i took a taste in the car, and couldnt wait to get home to finish! soooo much flavor! and they will make your food as needed. you must try the vegetables with chickpeas and the lamb will tip you over! definitely struck gold here! you wont regret the money spent.
stayed 1 night on business...its a brandnew hampton, with new room design that has a lot of fake wood flooring and cleaner lines on the furniture. i like it.staff is pleasant, and location is good...close to a lot of restaurants and shops. you can walk to a couple of places, and drive less than a mile to many more. definitely worth a stay if youre in the area...really convenient.
this is a very nice, new hampton inn. my room was super clean and had the most comfortable bed and pillows! i slept like a baby. there are plenty of options for food nearby, a starbucks a 12 mile away and easy access to the highway. the only negative for me a female business traveler was the shower. it looked nice and was clean...it even had a foot rest thing near the bottom of the shower to make it easier to shave your legs. the problem was the shower head wasnt movable only adjustable for spray type, so i had to turn off the water in order to shave or the stream would just wash away all my shave gel. doesnt seem so hard to turn the water off, but then you cant rinse your razor midshave and you also get hit with that initial blast of cold water because, again, you cant turn the shower head away from directly spraying you. thankfully the water pressure was good, though. that was a mouthful, i know. id stay here again if in the area, but id probably bring pants instead of a skirt next time.
honestly the best menudo ive been able to find in vegas comes from this resturaunt, ive personally dwnlded their app added as a favorite. great food perfectly proportioned delivered hot an fresh. thank you rami.
its fast food, so the quality is only going to get you so far, but nonetheless, the service is always great here. usually if i place an order for delivery, it arrives before the said time frame and the food is hot. i usually get the mao po tofu entree and they have yet to disappoint.
finally! theres a dim sum place in madison!!!!not as much as the chinatown in chicago, but the dim sum is already very good! would like to come back very often :
welcome to madison dim sum!! i am glad i dont have to go all the way to chicago to have dim sum. this restaurant its located where the china one was but they remodeled the place and it looks very nice now, more open and still with a lot of seating. they have a boat in the middle of the restaurant with a kind of aquarium to put live fish in it i imagine because there wasnt any today. they have a regular menu lots of exotic dishes like chicken feet, sea cucumbers, whole roasted peking duck, whole fish and many other ones i have never seen in another chinese restaurant, the dim sum menu and another piece of paper to fill out in case you want something from a little cart they are driving from time to time, i refer to already made dishes you can ask the person to leave at the table, i think thats a good idea in case you are starving. from the dim sum menu we had the 2 pork and shrimp dumplings 5 very good!!! 33 pork buns 3 spongy and tasty, they bring it in a sizzling skillet, like a fajita so they had a great sear on the outside 7 shrimp and pork bean curds 3 nice but not wow and finally dessert!  36 fried sesame balls 3 they were beautifully crispy with a delicious filling that tasted like dulce de leche or cajeta de leche. service was kind of slow but the staff was very nice. i would have liked that they had more items at the table to make a tastier sauce, they just have soy sauce, vinegar and chili oil, i had to ask for a sweet sauce. in general, the food gave us a good impression because they seemed authentic and well prepared. we will be back :
i am soooo excited that madison finally has a dim sum place after the one on w washington closed about a year ago.their food is good, not the best dim sum i i ever had. the price is okay, service is good. they even have peking duck listed in the menu, maybe i should try next time.
nani restaurant made a favorable impression during recent weekday lunch foray.  as an unabashed multicultural dumplingphile, i was pleased to see the early favorable reviews.  so i convinced a couple of coworkers to join me for a whirlwind trip through nanis dim sum menu.  its been years since i visited this location; i think it was an illfated mongolian stirfry place in that iteration.  the new owners definitely classed the place up with a thorough renovation, adding plenty of stylish lighting to give the place a more chic vibe as best you can for an old all you can eat buffet location.  the host immediately greeted us and led us to our table.  our server appeared before we were settled in and shared both the lunch menu mainly americanized chinese dishes and the expansive dim sum menu.  after a vigorous debate over the merits of many of the dim sum options, we decided on the pork pot stickers, shrimp and pork dumplings, bbq pork buns and one of spare rib options,  alas, no one was willing to sample the chicken feet with me  i had to save that dish for another time.  one of my coworkers also ordered the sesame chicken entree from the lunch menu.  shortly after we placed our order, the steam baskets with our dim sum offerings started hitting our table.  the exterior of the pot stickers had an impressive brown sear and the filling brimmed with porcine goodness.  for some unknown reason, the podstickers were bereft of any dipping sauce, which is an almost unpardonable omission.  the bbq pork bun were the weak link of the meal, with a too sweet bun and just a thimbleful of underseasoned pork nothing like the version of this dish than i devoured at umami earlier this year.the bonein pork spareribs were the showstopper of our meal.  packed in a flavorful broth, this dish provided a mouthful of flavor with every bite.  also impressive were the delectable shrimp and pork dumplings, though they also could have benefited from a dipping sauce.i felt the kitchen did an admirable job with the sesame chicken, which provided a pleasing crunch with every bite.  for a new restaurant that has had little fanfare, there was an active midweek lunch service.  many restaurants have come and gone from this building, hopefully nani can break the curse of this location.  there are far many dim sum offerings that i have yet to try.
i learned about nani thanks to yelp and immediately added it to my to try list. little did i know it would only be a few days later that id be asked me to decide where to meet someone for lunch. i am so happy we came here! the location is tucked just a bit out of the way, so folks might miss it if theyre driving through, but its absolutely worth checking out. id never visited the previous iterations, but agree with other reviewers who say that the interior is well done. for me, this doesnt always matter as much if the food is good, but i found it notable in this case.this is my first experience with dim sum, so i cant speak to authenticity or compare to other locations. what i can say is that i love most any asian cuisine ive tried and thought it was amazing. it doesnt hurt that im a fan of dumplings of pretty much any heritage. we spent most of our time going over the vast menus. first we were handed the lunch menu, which seemed to cover the sorts of americanchinese dishes i grew up with so we skipped it altogether. the dim sum menu was completely new to me, and my partner was enthralled by their main menu, which is huge. we were warned that the dishes in the main menu were meant to serve more than one person, and they were right, we had some leftovers to share with our housemates.i realized shortly after getting through the dim sum menu that id have to take a look at the rest later. i already wanted to try more than i could eat... so i chose the beef brisket with rice noodle in a pot, the pan fried vegetable and pork bun, and the sweet custard roll. everything was delicious, although i was surprised by the ratio of bun to limited filling and just a little put off by the skin and fatcartilage in the pot. of course, i realize thats probably more traditional than what im used to so i just picked through it. the flavor was very good. i shared those leftovers with one of my housemates when i got home and he ate the rest, so its clearly a matter of preference. the custard rolls were perfect... great fluffy texture while not too sweet. mmm.this particular companion is more adventurous than i am when it comes to food, so many options on the menu were tantalizing to him. he ended up ordering the ox tongue with tripe in chili sauce and loved it. from the dim sum menu he chose the shrimp crepes, which received an emphatic thumbs up while chewing. hes going to have to find someone else to try the chicken feet or octopus with, but i appreciate that those items are on the menu.service was great. our waitress checked in regularly and another young lady checked in with us to see if we had any questions. she was extremely helpful to us firsttimers. i was surprised by how quickly our dishes started coming out; we were eating in notime. extra bonus points for their tea service. i had a nice big metal pot of green tea to myself. no dinky miniteapot, and this baby stayed hot the whole time we were there. this alone made me pretty happy, but add everything else and i simply cant wait to come back again and again to continue trying other items on their menu.
lowering my standards a little bit because there is only 1 actual dimsum place in madison? yes, but...i went for the first time on saturday morning with 3 other friends, and we ordered around 89 dishes. i think it was a good amount and variety, and we almosttt finished it. we ordered the shumai good, congee good, chinese donut great, rice cake wrap things with beef okay, sticky rice good, pork bun.. the more bready one good.. and some others. overall, food was good.i do think they are still working on figuring out their service and cart situation, but im hopeful! i shall take what i can get for now we ate as much as we wanted and paid 15 bucks each, which i was happy with. i remember eating less and paying more when i went to places in both socal and norcal.
no need to drive to chicago for din sum. this place is as good as u going  get in mad town.  its kinda expensive. my only recommendation is to gather a group of 4 or more ppl so u can try more stuff. also, it ll be little cheaper. we had 3 ppl eight dim sums 52 for lunch.
pros: solid dimsum, nice interior, 247 offthemenu dim sumcons: very long wait timesif you ever crave dim sum in madison, this is a nice spot to hit up. they have a pretty good selection of typical dim sum dishes. the shrimp dumplings, curried cuttlefish, and crepes were pretty good and standard. im not generally a dim sum person, but when i get that onceinabluemoon dim sum craving, ill return.
as others have commented, roast duck is good. it was tasty and the skin was crispy. there were other roasted meat on the cart as well as the kai lan chinese broccoli. the verge was good. a big portion for 7.95. i could have a smaller portion for less moolah.tried other traditional items like crepes, bean curd, siu mai, etcgenerally the dim sum items were decent. is it the best? no but it is the best in madison. crepe skin was too thick and sauce was not enough and hardly tasty. bean curd skin item was salty and not the soupy type. whats good? siu mai, shrimp dumplings, deep fried pork dumpling, fried radish, and chicken feet. next time i will try the porridge and other dinner items and comment.
i have been here two times in the past month. both times were good. i forget the dish numbers but will try to remember what i ate. the bbq pork bun was good. as well as the shrimp spring rolls. people have said that they can be greasy and i agree. the shrimp in all the dumplings had nice texture to it. you could tell it was real shrimp and not imitation meat. also had the beef brisket with crepe noodles. i liked this dish. if you want earthy and minerally beef flavor go for this dish. the fat noodles soak up all the broth and are starchy and delicious. get the short ribs in the spicy sauce. those are bigger than the ones in honey sauce. tried more dishes but this is what i remember. glad this place opened up because im tired of nasty chinese buffets and restaurants catering to what america thinks chinese food is. im not chinese and cant vouch for the authenticity of this place, but it seems like they kept everything authentic. im so tired of american culture force feeding us crap. i want to try the real thing! i want to eat food that chinese people eat in china! i want to experience a different culture through the food. i dont want a knockoff fried american version of it. this is not one of those places. the ingredients are fresh and everything seems to be made to order. expect to spend 25 per person if you want to try a lot of different dishes. i recommend coming with a group of 35 people so you can share dishes and experience more. if it sounds good just try it! i shall return and will try more things on the menu.
the quality must have gone up since becoming a restaurant instead of a buffett because i thought the food was delicious. i got three items below and all three were wonderful! the only reason i am giving it 4 starts instead of 5 is it seems a little spendy. the mei fun was a large plate but most of their beef dishes were 18.95. singapore mei fun 12.95pork  shrimp dumpling 4.95beef ball 4.50
good and real chinese dim sum, so far. not a place you will be treated with american chinese food which is the whole point of going. service could use some improvement such as water refills and so on. taste is generally good, portion size is right on, and atmosphere is quiet. the seating feel cramped for no good reason and i do want to see more big round tables for big family or gettogether thingy. i wish them good luck because there are limited chinese places in madison i can go for chinese food.
pretty solid dim sum. the shrimp dumplings are pretty legit and the congee is among the best ive had stateside. the servers our courteous and they were pretty fast when i went with my husband over a weekend. they have a restaurant style system rather than the push carts you see at more traditional places but thats fine because youre plate is being prepped to order rather than waiting for the cart you want to come by. ill definitely be bringing my friends to this place.
i was impressed with the decor and cleanliness to begin with. i am coming here for the first time. loved the picture menu where we can actually see what to order. we ordered 2 appetizers and 7 different plates for 5 people. loved our two appetizers: munbean noodle and tongue and tripe with chili oil sauce. xiao long buns were worth getting. very tasty. we also got short ribs with pepper sauce which was delicious. heres some of the items we didnt care for: shrimp dumpling w green chives, deep fried pork dumpling its a sweet dough??, pan fried green chive cake. all in all, we would love to come again. my personal favorite: szechuan munbean noodle!!!
2nd trip back. this time, we are here to try their dinner selections. ordered mah lah beef brisket claypot, hong shau tofu braised tofu, roast duck and west lake beef soup. first  it was quite at 8pm. food was delicious and exceeded my expectations.  starting with the old favorites, the duck continues to taste good. skin wasnt as crispy as the first time but taste is consistent. west lake beef soup was very good. best ive had within the last year. the beef brisket claypot  my oh my. wonderful taste. i was afraid that it will be too spicy for me but not do. it was spicy in a flavorful way. definitely give it a try. the braised tofu is ok. nothing to brag about. i prefer the cantonese style with square tofu with a smoother texture. this is not the right type of tofu to use. we called this tau kwa. very firm. also the vegetables used were too westernized for me, carrots and peppers. ideally this would be made with more mushrooms, baby back choy and maybe some small bits of carrots for colors. overall a good experience and will return to try other dishes.
my first foray into dim sum. the food was very good.  there were four us and we ordered 10 dishes. waaaay too much food.  my favorite dishes were the fried sesame with red bean and the pork soup dumplings  which i am positive have a more official name.  the service was slow and we were never sure who to ask when we needed something.  the ten dishes came to 60 which i thought was a good price. i would definitely come again albeit with lower service expectations.
typical chinese zaocha, try twice. nothing bad, just common taste. you cannot choose other restaurants for zaocha, because this is the only one in madison. only one thing makes me down, they charge me twice for a dinner because of machine issue. they said it would be refunded soon, i am waiting.
authentic dim sum! its been a few years since ive had really great dim sum in san franciscos chinatown. nanis was pretty darn good for what i expected to find in madison, wi. lots of chinese patrons when me, my brother and bf visited, which is a good sign.  service was very helpful and courteous.  i was not a fan of the congee as it was watered down than how i make it, but everything else on the menu was on point. will definitely be back for more.also, this was recently renovated from the former chinese buffet restaurant.
lets keep this short and sweet.best dim sum in the area by far, but service is lacking. they expect you to call for attention if you need anything. if you do that they will be happy to help with anything you want.also yes beef balls!
been there once for dim sum this past weekend.  so far so good.i ordered 7 dim sum dishes just to try a few different items.1 shrimp dumplings  shrimp filling was fantastic.  dumpling skin a little thick but passable.2 siu mai shrimppork dumpling  when it was piping hot out of the kitchen it was pretty tasty, but overall it was good, not great3 pan fried turnip cake  pretty authentic.  made well, and good sear from the pan.  my favorite of the afternoon.4 shrimp crepe  shrimps were a bit small, the crepe was a bit thick.  sauce was okay5 beef crepe  beef was good, but same crepe thickness issue6 beef balls  there were four of these.  these were humungous.  a little denser than im used to, but the taste was good.  it was more of the beef balls you eat at hot pot than the ones you would find at a traditional dim sum place.7 shrimpchive dumpling  really good filling, good chive taste.  the dumplings were huge!  it was well made.when i go again, i would pass on the crepes and try something else.  there were many other dishes that i did not get a chance to try.  overall for madison, this was fantastic, so i will go again for sure.  the price is a bit higher than chinatown in like chicago or new york, but for madison you cant really complain too much about that.  service was a bit slow even with just 10 tables, but i didnt have to wait too long for the food once i got the order in.so i would highly recommend this over driving 2.5 hours to chicago for dim sum which ive done!.
cmon, given that there is only one place in madison with a reasonablyauthentic and rather large dimsum menu, how can you give it less than 4 stars if you like dimsum?  yes, if they had any competition theyd get knocked down to three stars for the service just flag a server down ever been to china?  they just yell across the room and snap their fingers over there, and maybe even down to two stars for pissing you off for adding in a mandatory service charge.  and yeah, they dont have carts, but so what?bottom line go with as many friends as possible, order a lot of different stuff, and enjoy it for what it is!
you should never judge a book by its cover. this store really didnt look like much from the outside just a single banner covering what seemed to be the signage from the previous establishment, but upon entering i was quite surprised because this little market looked very nice. i think its bigger than what it seemed; it felt very cozy for sure.the shelves were all neat and everything was very wellorganized. they also seem to have a wider selection of items than other filipino markets around the area. they basically have all the filipino basics: frozen bangus, filipino meriendas snacks like piattos and rollercoaster potato rings, and different noodles for pancit and palabok dishes!they also had a section for personal carecosmetic items. they had filipino cosmetic staples such as eskinol and sunsilk. they had other brands like dove and old spice there, too.if you continue on towards the back, they had a nice little selection of produce there. among their selection was: ginger, long green beans, and onions. they had signs and prices out for okra, but i didnt see any there. they also have a good selection of filipino ice creams and individual soda cans. customer service was a bit subpar, the employees werent really interactive but thats okay because they still greeted us when we came in.this pinoy market offers a wide selection of filipino groceries. its super convenient if you dont want to wait long lines at a grocery store for stuff like laundry detergent. ill definitely come back and shop here for whenever i need anything for my filipino home cooking or basic household needs.its new, but this place looks very promising.
great service, convenient location. customer waiting room is clean but chairs are not comfortable. chairs should be design to accommodate large persons or persons with disabilities.
friendly staff..great tasting and quality pizza..i was very impressed for my first time.  and very clean place to eat
i love the unlimited toppings. i love that you have a choice to create your pizza the way you want too. i love the set up of the restaurant. but i really love pauline the manager she is so helpful she really knows her stuff. shes always friendly and polite when i come in. sometimes i walk by just too see if shes there and if shes not i keep going. she is wonderful i love her personality
this place is tasty!!!!! they were out of wheat crust when we ordered, which is the only reason i am not giving them 5 stars. all of the toppings are fresh, the service is quick and it tasted delicious. my girlfriend did mention that at some of the other build your own pizza places, they offer to switch gloves when gluten free crust is ordered to not cross contaminate, which was not the case here. just a suggestion if the owner happens to read this
first time here and i am very impressed. they are very clean and have so many choices. regular crust and gluten free and they even have vegan meat toppings! the food was delicious and very reasonably priced! the service was great everyone is very friendly.  i will definitely be back! yum pizza!!!
this is an awesome place! i met one of the owners, kelly, who visited my store. we got to talking and she told me about her place. i said i would check it out and grab dinner at her pizza kitchen. sorry for the 4s, but i tend to love plush dough crust and here its more of a thin crust. dont get me wrong the pizza is fantastic! and for the price, spectacular. 7.99 unlimited toppings. where could you go wrong??? and they serve gelato!
my masterpiece was delicious: bbq and pesto sauce mixture, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, spicy sausage,  bacon crumble, red onions,  lots of cilantro and then another layer of cheese, tomatoes and jalapenos... after the pizza cooked they sprinkled basil and blue cheese on top. omg amazing. it was like an explosion of intense taste in my mouth. i briefly got annoyed that they charged me extra for a small side of ranch dressing. its petty to charge for that, especially at a place that allows unlimited toppings, but whatever... the food was delicious and ill be back. just bring a fur coat, a snuggie  and a blanket because it is freezing cold in there. dont expect your pizza to stay hot that long... brrrr.
from the outside of this building, it looks like a restaurant as you walk inside its a whole different place. is it a bar, bowling alley, billards, etc...?  its a fusion and a blend of all these components here at the piedmont social house. nikki has of way of putting these amazing events to expose the yelpers and the community about these hidden treasures in charlotte, nc. the food sampling was delicious. my all time favorite was the pretzel dipped in beer batter mix. wow. veggie wrap and chicken with waffle was tasty.met newbie elite member cassaundra and congrats to the newly engaged couple michelle p and ron. saw kelly c. scored a strike at one of the bowling lanes.love the make it yourself smores kit gift bags.thank you nikki for another fantastic event.
so to review the event only, not the business i give many stars.  but to be honest, i doubt id come back to review the place.  parking sucks and im rarely in steele creek, and im antishared shoes just ask my sister who wears the same size as me no!!  so bowling is out for me.however, yelp elite pulls off another entertaining evening of fun!  quick checkin thank you brittany, adorable swag marshmallows!, great charity to support with useful raffle prizes.  nikki works hard to get these events together and it shows every time how well executed they are.  the staff was very kind  brad is my hero for the night who went well above to make sure i was able to try their signature peach drink the iced tea one was delicious as well.  more drinks... red oak amber is fantastic and a local label i havent seen too often; which really makes me want to buy a sixer.food was really good  the exact same chicken tender served 3 different ways?? well done psh, thats pure profit!  the catfish was my favorite, properly cooked with a light batter; tender yet firm.good food, great atmosphere, awesome yelpers  this was another excellent yelp elite event!
i thoroughly enjoyed piedmont social house!! i will definitely be returning. if this is what being yelp elite is about, finding treasures around the city, im sold!! big thank you to everyone who puts these events together! parking sucks but that was just a minor thing. i loved that this was a place that you could come to with your friends and just hang out. theres so much to do and its such a big space! the food was delicious. the last thing that i would order at any restaurant would be a vegetable wrap but they have changed my mind! i cant wait to come back just for that! its now a lunch idea! the chicken and waffles were also good. who wouldve thought that id enjoy honey mustard on my waffle!?! i didnt get to try much else, as i was up by the lanes and not much made it up there. but from the sample i got, for a social house, it was really good. the drinks were also delicious. anything sweet tea has my heart. shoutout to red oak for putting me on to a new beer  the free glass! im not even a beer drinker! i loved that the bowling lanes were divided into 2 sections and there was plenty of room to lounge. i can definitely see me and my girlfriends coming in here, cutting up and epicly failing at pool! walking out i saw a group of people hanging out and playing corn holes. i didnt even notice those walking in! its always awesome to see people just relaxing, enjoying themselves. i told my sister about this place and she is planning to come this weekend!as for the event itself,i found it to be a bit cliqueish. im new to elite, fresh 1 week old. i didnt really know what to expect from a yelp elite event. in my head, there would be more introductions and intermingling with the elite, especially with the leaders. seemed everyone only talked to their own friends or the longtime yelpers. i ride solo a lot of the times with my work schedule and living so far away. but i may try calling up some local friends for future events. i didnt want to bother anyone with driving so far south for this event. maybe its just because im so new that i feel this way. but well see how it goes at future events because ill definitely keep showing up no matter what! but shoutout to mrs. jane for making me feel so welcome!! everyone seemed to be friendly enough, no attitudes and everyone seemed to have been really enjoying themselves which is always good to see!! i also ended up meeting who could possibly be a cousin, one of the managers there. were from the same city 1 12 hours away and have mutual family members. small world! cant wait for the next event!
ayrsley is not on my usual circuit, but i was glad that i made the trek both to see the space piedmont has created and to reconnect with the charlotte elite crew.getting in with a full house of parking in this continuouslygrowing area can be a challenge, and this night was no exception, but once inside, the energy of piedmont social house was apparent, as the greeters were greeting, the servers were serving and the place was rocking.before long, it was apparent that there was a perfect spot to be stationed for the food as it came out of the kitchen, so that is where a large portion hung out, and just about everything was sampled and sampled well  the pretzels and cheese dip, the chicken strips and awesome sauce,  the chicken and waffles, the chicken wraps i think there were two!, the catfish and grits, even the putupon vegetable wraps that no one seemed to want.all was good, but those chicken and pimento cheese wraps were simply amazing.as psh works the kinks out of the menu, im sure that the dishes will all catch up to the amazing service that they provide  and if they just provide some awesome sauce with everything, it may not matter much.huge thanks for them hosting our hungry, hungry crowd, our gal nikki for putting together another great event and of course our personal paparazzo from poprock for capturing it all for posterity!
great event hosted by nikki and the crew at piedmont social house psh.  i work down in ballantyne, so ayrsley is not as far off the beaten path as it is for some people.  came right around 19:00 and was greeted with a new, fresh looking restaurant  bar  bowling alley with lots of young professionals sitting outside having a drink.  the yelp event was in a private area in the back, and it became quite full by 19:30.  food started coming out, and there were a lot of good bar food options  chicken tenders, chicken and waffles, pimento cheese chicken wrap, and fish and grits.  also enjoyed the red oak beers available and chatting with sales guys who gets to sell beer for a living  i want that job!!.  will definitely be recommending this place for a work happy hour sooner rather than later!  thank yelp charlotte squad!
beautiful venue. spacious layout, with plenty of areas to just show up  party with a private group . was really surprised how big it is. lovely modern decor.staff was incredibly friendly and vibrant.the items i sampled were well presented  fresh, yet were short on seasoning. i missed the grits and catfish, so cannot speak to that, but tried everything else. freshness wins everytime though,  especially when theres never a salt  pepper shaker too far away.will definitely return with friends in the near future.
wow...i just realized that i forgot to review this event! oops! but, better late than never! we had a great time bowling and enjoyed tasting all the yummy munchies that came out. the servers were all  nice, helpful, and welcoming. the place had a cool vibe inside and a super awesome patio. the selection  of food  bevvies is sure to please even the pickiest of eaters. we got to try the smoked beer cheese dip with soft pretzel bites yum!l veggie patch wraps, and the fried catfish  grits. unfortunately we missed out on the chicken  waffles... we should have hung out with joe  i am sure they would have hooked us up too! ; but regardless, we had a great time  enjoyed the venue!  thanks to nikki  the generosity of the folks at piedmont social house for a wonderful evening. also thanks to tonya at poprock  for shooting some great pics!
モントリオールのオールドタウン中心にある、素敵なカフェ。ここ３週間前に開店したとの事。観光で散策していた際に、見るだけだったが、美味しそうなので、ワッフルとジェラートを楽しんだ。店員さんも、英語が得意でない日本人にも、丁寧に説明してくれて、優しい。夏の暑い日に一息入れられる店。
great little find, coffee well brewed, waffles perfectly cooked, crispy throughout, fruit toppings and maple syrup were perfect combination, also had egg pancake sandwiches which were real good.
food: 45service: 45cleanliness: 45price: 35cafe a plus bistro has a bit of everything, with their main specialty being tea. as you can see above, the cafe sells a variety of teas, coffee, and other goodies. i took a quick look at them, and i cant wait to come back and buy some, as i love collecting tea.another reason why i love this cafe is because they sell waffles here. i didnt order one when i visited but its on my musttry list for this cafe. aside from waffles, fresh juices, sandwiches, and more are available for takeout or for dinein. the sandwiches look very fresh and good in my opinion, and i read that they sell sandwiches on fairmount bagels here, so thats another plus!hubby and i ordered our drinks and we looked around the cafe a little bit. not only do they have seats on the ground floor, the cafe also had a second floor with more tables and seats for customers. we decided to see whats upstairs...we were both impressed with their second floor and we happily decided to enjoy our time upstairs. there were sofas to lounge in, magazines for reading, clean tables to work at... what more do you need in a cafe? with free wifi, this is my ultimate hideout.we were both very satisfied with our drinks. my matcha latte was very well done, complete with foam and everything. i was a little disappointed with the size of my latte though; for the price, i felt like it was a little overpriced but i suppose its because of the import of japanese tea leaves. hubbys long espresso was very satisfactory! my husband isnt fond of light coffee, and at cafe a plus bistro, it seemed heavenly. the aroma of the coffee was great, the crema was well done, and overall the flavours of the espresso was in our opinion, one of the best in montreal. none of the acidic stuff here! if youre like us, youd like coffee and espresso here.overall, cafe a plus bistro is a great addition to old montreals cafe scene. the twostory cafe is definitely not very well known yet but we wouldnt be surprised if its full of students and professionals the next time we visit. yes, cafe tommy is just a block away, but i think id come here from time to time because the drinks are better and its much easier to find seating.
yummy pizza and salads.  plenty of options from which to choose.  lots of pizza competition in this part of town but, nonetheless, a welcome addition to the neighborhood!
i never thought about going to a sauce restaurant until they opened one down the street for my house. i had the arugula and quinoa salad with goat cheese.....lots of yummy delicious goat cheese. my husband had the kale and salmon salad. the salmon was broken into small pieces instead of whole. i think its because they could skimp on the salmon and youll never know the difference. we each had a piece of artichoke, mushroom, roasted red pepper  goat cheese bruschetta. everything taste delicious. our total for dinner plus a glass of red wine was 32. we didnt know fresh bread came with the salad, well probably skip the bruschetta next time and just eat the bread. the table next to us ordered pizza. the crust looked super thin and short on toppings. being from chicago im picky about pizza. that being said, im not in love with deep dish, but i like a substantial slice. ill try for myself next time.sauce is very, very kid friendly. if kids are not your thing they are not mine then i would go later in the evening or for lunch. babies screaming in the line. kids running around the outside patio. little girls making a mess at the self serve beverage bar. all in all, a pleasant experience and we will return.....for lunch or when it is past the kids bed time.
while i have to continue supporting the sauce by my place, this brand new one right across from ajs is very nice.  i am sure their spacious patio will be very popular.the cashier was very friendly.  my food took a little longer than i expected, but to be fair i usually get a panini.  i did appreciate the cashier boxing everything up nicely and asking if i needed napkins and such.unfortunately, my spicy chicken sausage pizza, which i thought would just have crumbled chicken sausage on it, was blanketed with jalapenos.  i longsufferingly picked off every one of the little green peppers.  after my pizza was properly picked over, it was fine.  good temperature, nice crust i got the handtossed, decent cheese.  its not federal pizza level but its very solid, especially as a quicker, cheaper around 10 togo option.my slice of cheesecake was quite good, and a nice medium size...not huge cheesecake factory but more than a tiny sliver.i had no problem with parking in the evening.  other than a rude car picking someone up and blocking the way...please park if youre picking someone up and there are cars behind you!
third time in 4 days! am i addicted??? loving salads at sauce and...gf pizza! very attentive staff and servers. sauce is a new favorite for the currier clan!
i ordered the suprema on thin crust and it was good!  this spot, just opened up recently, nice ambiance, sharp decor and friendly staff.  i will be back.
we stopped in last weekend on the pet friendly patio to enjoy a nice lunch of pizza!  the servers were so friendly and welcoming and loved having our pup on their patio.  they actually took our order at the table, so one of us didnt have to go in and leave the other and the pup  nice touch!  we enjoyed a sausage and caramelized onion pizza and a smoked ham and mushroom pizza  crispy, flavorful and delicious!
friendly service and great coffee, roasted inhouse! tucked away into a hidden spot at sahara and buffalo, desert wind is a quiet spot to snag a cup. highly recommend the breaking bad, a slightlysweet twoshot espresso drink. hopefully they will expand their snackpastry selection, they currently just carry a couple of cookies and muffins.
what a nice find!   tucked away in the northeast corner of the shopping center at buffalo and sahara, behind the cheap gas place,  pam and alexia treated us just fabulously and the coffee was great too.  i just had a regular decaf pour over and it was lovely!  the seating is comfy on the tush, too!  ill be back with friends.
absolutely amazing!  jessica and alesha have both done my lashes. they are knowledgeable, experts who are very nice and professional.  i trust them for the beauty and saftey of my lashes!  i would not go anywhere else!!!
only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is due to theyre inability at this time to take starbucks members cards  i will update accordingly once this is correctedim soooooooo happy this opened. its so convenient and the staff is great. frankie always takes care of me but everyone else seems awesome too.awesome to be able to grab my coffee, grab my daughter a chocolate milk and a muffin and go sit and watch the ducks.the crackcoffee weve all known and come to love...and fiend for...is now in mesa riverview.
i like that most of the menu items have the calories listed. calories for tofu fries vs. jicama fries were not listed, but the helpful person at the counter was able to tell me. nice, helpful employees. i got an extra lean angus beef burger, and it was delicious. i always enjoy having a healthier option. certainly not cheap though.
this is a new location, and im already a fan of greens and proteins. the menu was a bit different from the flamingo location by lvac. i loved the acai berry shake with extra protein powder. definitely a great way to fuel up after a workout. service was on point.
jump on the train!  eat healthy!  this new place is located within walking distance of my office, and when im there which is almost never i head over for lunch.  great salads, and even better juices, with a friendly staff and a casual atmosphere.  i always feel weird about leaving dirty dishes on a table in a fast casual restaurant like this, but im warming to the idea.  summer berry spinach salad, harvest kale stocked salad, and bison cheese steak are current faves.  try a wellness drink or a green ginger limeade, and you too will be a happy, healthy human!
had the pleasure of trying this location out today for the first time. got my order to go, staff member was very friendly and very diligent. nothing short of great in that department. the greens and proteins breakfast wrap w spinach wrap it lacked a little on the flavor, and was surprisingly messy. couldnt say that i was a fan, and no amount of tofu fries could make up for this dish. the southwest tofu  chorizo burrito w spinach wrap  this burrito was a good one. the flavor is amazing all the while not as messy as one would have expected. a good mix of ingredients overall making the tofu really blend in. as always the tofu fries are the best part. green ginger limeade  very fresh and refreshing, could practically taste each individual ingredient.  watermelon strawberry cocktail  not as refreshing as i wouldve expected, the strawberries tasted almost like preserved ones. maybe just not as good in comparison to the green ginger limeade
groupon alert! 6 for 12  for this location and their flamingo location adding date for relevance: 90515ive been here twice to date  once for a coworker lunch and again on a solo breakfast trip. im a fan of their flamingo location since im trying to trim down and eat clean. i like coming here since this spot gives me options to choose from outside of ordering salads. on my last trip, i ordered their green ginger limeade green grapes, spinach, ginger, lime, and opted out of the addition of stevia. i make green smoothies at home and havent thought of this combo. its naturally sweet and green grapes and ginger tone down the addition of spinach. its a quick and tasty way to get your fruits and veggies in.  i loved the blend of flavors and strong ginger kick. this spot isnt just for smoothies or fresh juices. they offer up a health conscious menu  sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, burgers, salads and more clean eating grub. ive sampled their bison burger and chicken satay in the past and both have  been tasty options. the have a prime southwest location and may be found within the shopping center same one as starbucks, cracked egg and archies on the corner of sunset and s. rainbow.  i really enjoy having the option of grabbing a nutritious treat around the corner from our office. my coworkers and i have secured this spot as part of our lunch rotation. .
what can i say except for healthy can be good! its about time i try to get a hold on my health and protein and greens provide a great variety of food and drinks to help you on your journey. menu item are kinda pricey as expected but its not cheap to feel and look good. but you can either pay now for healthy food option or later with your health. regardless if you do try them out you wont be disappointed. i order the cali wrap with spinach tortilla and no added avocado but the whole meal with tofu fries was under 300 cal. what? unheard of. the wrap was big filled with yummy grilled chick a bit dry but flavorful. tofu fries was crispy and on point i didnt miss the potato. i got the green shake with almond milk which was good and creamy. they also have awesome cucumber lemon water which was refreshing. all that was 19.99 like i said a bit pricey for one meal but worth every penny.  the staff was super friendly and the restaurant was uber hip. im a new fan and will come back for more!
bbq chicken pizza. this is the second most popular dish according to the server so i figured why not. im not sure how healthy it is, but it tasted like a regular pizza or one you might get at cpk california pizza kitchen. im not a huge fan of cpk or anything, but maybe the flavors reminded me of it. service was amazing!!!!!!
so after multiple check ins i finally decided to write a review. . .yeah yeah. . .we can all get lazy sometimes.  lolthis last check in. . .i actaully tried their food for the first time.  every other time that i have gone, i got smoothies.  more on them later. . .i got their daily special of turkey chili with cannellini beans.  tbh, i got it cuz it was warm and i was actually cold that day. . .lol  but i gotta give them props. . .if you had not told me that it was healthy i would never had thought that it was.  it was freaking delicious!  the mouth feel was just like a meaty chili, flavor had just the small amount of heat that just made you want to take another bite.  it came with some lavash which added some great crunch to the dish.  i would go back just for this dish.  it was that good!!  and to think that it was acutally healthy for me. . .gasp  lol  55the second dish was kind of a fail for me.  i love chicken lettuce wraps and i order their raw cashew chicken lettucs wraps.  the look of it was cute.  they served it on little butter lettuce leaves with a little micro greens on top.  the flavor was not like a chicken lettuce wrap.  the texture was not like a chicken lettuce wrap. . .and like a dummy i didnt realize until that i bit into that it was a raw food which meant that nothing was heated.  so it was a cold mealy scoop of cashews mixed with something on a lettuce cup.  i do not reccomend.  unless you are totally into raw foods. . .i am guessing if i was that i might have liked it??  i honestly dont know what i was expecting but i was thinking with the words chicken lettuce wrap in it that it would feel like chicken and taste like a traditional lettuce wrap in my mouth?? 15service. . .always impeccable!  55smoothies. . .including the veggiechino. . .yes u read that right. . .a vegetable smoothie with espresso in it. . .omg delicious!!!  55overall, heck yeah i am going back. . .but next time i will definitely skip the raw foods section. . .lesson learned!  
holy opening weekend batman. im excited they are opening a location here in the west valley. i love wincos low price, basic model. no frills but always good quality. also, just like their other locations, i found the staff friendly, attentive, and helpful. makes shopping for a family of 6 bearable. i will however try not to go on saturday mornings. its a madhouse in there. definitely worth checking out.
this new winco is located off of the 303 freeway and bell in surprise. my first time here is during the grand opening. no parking and no cart available of course due to that.  i knew that was going to happen. there was only one way in and that was congested because a lot of the deals are right when you walk in and it continued as i tried to get through the produce.  that was also expected.  then as i maneuvered my way through that i was able to walk freely through the large store.  this store has bulk goods and an good deals on meat.  i find that the prices are bit cheaper than walmart and other competitors. you will find a random deal here and there and that is a plus.i found some awesome deals on meat.  eggs are cheaper than the other stores. so if you are looking for a dozen eggs your best bet is to come here during the spike on eggs. when i came here every register was open which made my checkout easy.  i cant say this will be the same after the grand opening but at this time it is nice. my cashier was super friendly.winco takes coupons and that is a plus in my eyes.  you do have to bag your own groceries.  i will shop here in the future but i will continue to shop at other stores for sales.
just visited the new winco in surprise, but did so at 6 a.m. when it was cooler out, and the parking lot was easier to navigate.  overall, a nice place with decent prices and items instock  on the shelves for easy access.  some items are jumbopacks, but most items are standard sizes at good prices.  just a few complaints...the fact that they do not accept credit cards is a big downsidei had to make a trip through the driveup atm at my bank before shopping here, as i dont use debit cards.  the staff are all very friendly and appear to be more knowledgeable than at most other grocery stores, but they still do not understand the importance of keeping the aisles clear while they are restocking items.  granted, i was there early but this is arizona in the summer, so 6 a.m. is not all that early, and several aisles were completely blocked by restocking activities, which means that i did not bother to look at items on those aisles at all.  finally, im not a fan of having to bag my own items, but i can live with thatin fact, i do it better myself than most grocery store employees.  winco is not going to replace costco for me, but i do like this place and will be back.
i like this store, nothing to complain about. i wouldnt come if i wanted to buy vegetables. i really liked checkout lines though. :
this winco just opened last week while we were in ca.  this place opened right across the street from albertsons and right next door to safeway.  competition at its finest!  their concept seems pretty cool.  employee owned and low prices.  sounded good.  we drove down here today to check it out.  it was my first time in a winco.parking was a bit of an issue.  we had to park way in the back of the parking lot.  not too big of a deal but in this az heat, whenever you have to park far away, that means your cold items will be exposed to the heat for longer...even if its an extra minute or two, that can wreak havoc on certain things!  we made our way through the parking lot, grabbed a cart near the front and walked in.  it immediately reminded me of food 4 less.  you have to walk in and take a right.  they have all their deals of the week in this little section and then you wind up in the produce area.  the layout of the rest of the store was alright.  there were a lot of areas that were super clusterfucked but that was partly due to idiots who have no sense of their surroundings and no common courtesy to push their cart to the side of the aisle.  lot of assholes in this world.  anyways.........my two favorite parts of the store were.1.  prices!  their prices were significantly lower than other grocery stores and on par with or even lower cost than walmart prices.  they have their competitors prices marked on signs as well so you can definitely tell how much you are saving.  they had the huge cardboard box of goldfish crackers for only 6.00.  its at least 8.00 everywhere else.  they had their own brand of nacho cheese tortilla chips for .48 cents.  yup... not even 50 cents for a regular large size bag of chips.  they werent the best things ever and dont compare with actual real dorritos, but for .48 cents, they cant be beat!2.  bulk bin items.  they have everything from coffee, nuts, candy, spices, flour, peanut butter, dog food etc.  pretty much anything you can think of.  my wife got a pound of white sugar for like .50 cents.  i will definitely be back to utilize these bulk bins.we got a lot of things for a great price.  you bag your own groceries which is cool with me.  if it saves on cost, ill do it.  prices are so low that they dont carry everything they didnt have my favorite hot sauce or coffee, but most major brands they will have in stock. open 247 which is awesome. cash or debit card only...they dont accept credit cards.  we will definitely be back!
i used to shop at winco often when i lived in oregon so i made the drive to surprise to check out the new store. walking into the store was like visiting an old friend for me. it is set up like all of the other stores i have been in. i was impressed with the quality and prices of the produce and i really loved the bulk food area as well. there are so many options to choose from and its nice to be able to buy a large or small amount for a great price. i noticed some good savings on the products i usually buy although some items were the same or higher than what i am used to. unless you buy the 10 package of hamburger its cheaper at frys. i feel like i got a lot for what i spent and i will most likely return when i want to do some major shopping. it would be awesome to have a store closer to my home goodyear. oh as an added plus there were some of my favorite brands here that i have not been able to find since we moved. yay!
found coupons in the mail for a free box of ritz crackers and a jug of arizona tea, so i had to check it out. went early this morning 5am and had to drive around empty shopping carts strewn about in the parking lot, which i found strange.prices are good for produce and dairy, meats seemed a little high to me.clean store and friendly staff. dont know if it will replace my frys with their gas savings program and meat specials or my neighborhood walmart for quick shopping, but i will definitely go back for another comparison.also, i like that on their website they have a store layout pdf. i wish more stores would do this as i liken any type of shopping to a dental visit.
introduction love this store! it first went to my attention when me and my relatives discovered several coupons and price comparisons. it sounded like heaven to us, food that is actually namebrand and inexpensive. generic stuff generally tastes like crappros as soon as i went into that store, it had a whole case of water for only 99 cents! i later picked up a basket, since i wasnt buying much. i got a liter of soda, much cheaper than walmarts great value brand. i got a few pouches of goldfish, obviously saving. i got candy for myself, same serving style as sprouts. a few frozen dinners, produce and turkey meat later, i checked out. nervous, i put everything on the counter, where i bagged my own stuff. i only spent somewhere between 1525 dollars! i have yet to revisit! everything is inexpensive, and namebrand, everything is organized and neat.cons it doesnt look like a grocery store at all, more leaning towards a home depot or lowes of food.  you have to bag your own groceries, so you cant see what the clerk is doing, so if they over charged you two or three times, you wont know till you get home then youll be p off.  its so crowded going everywhere, and you dont even know where you are in the store. everything is inconveniently placed, one minute youre in produce, one minute youre in frozen foods. summary: i like this winco, it just needs minor improvements here and there. expect me back :d
lets start out with a cheery goodbye to albertsons, safeway and frys. when is the going out of business sale? youve been ripping us off for so long. sure, your loss leader sale items have been pretty good, but you more than make it up on overpriced inferior produce and just about everything else. just yesterday, your vine ripened tomatoes were 1.99lb. wincos were .48lb. free gas? not worth it. now, about winco. just about everything in the store is less expensive than the supermarket chain stores and the cheap winco brand items only concede a little bit in quality. except the chips which ill pass on for now on.bulk shopping here is exceptional. bag your own candy, spices, rubs, nuts flour etc. from the dispensers and save a fortune. cinnamon sticks, which are about 13lb, come out to pennies when you throw a handful into a plastic bag. the selection of canned, bottled and frozen foods is beyond compare. most ethnic cooks may need not look anywhere else. yesterday, powerade bottles were .48 each. half the price of frys 10 for 10 sales. you get the point. big savings and incomparable selection. the skeleton staff is as friendly and helpful as they can be. the people stocking the shelves are not winco employees. they work for the suppliers. dont ask them anything and dont confuse them for store personnel.  now. there are a few caveats. this is a bare bones store. no credit cards because bank fees would up prices by about 3. but they do take debit cards.never enough cashiers on hand or employees on the floor for assistance. large and confusing floor plan. lowest quality beef. i never even heard of select. butchers carry prime. most grocery stores have choice. if you buy the beef, have a crock pot on hand or marinade overnight. i bought a 1.79lb pork loin which cooked up nicely but ill take sams or costcos meat case any day. the deli counter is a mixed bag. deli meats are not cut fresh from the pack. they are presliced and laying around, exposed in the deli case.  if you come early thats ok. but later in the day its a little gross. the quality is ok and prices cant be beat. the midday rush is maddening. cant wait for the snowbirds to arrive. whoever made the point about shoppers being in the way, was right. we retirees dont process like we used to. this makes us confused and dazed. today i witnessed several bottlenecks and some near collisions. patience, my dear.  one more point. about self bagging. never bagged my own groceries before. first time i did it, i realized that there are logical ways to do it. go figure. i prefer doing it myself.
prices are great i just hate that if it is out they put the wrong stuff in  to fill the hole and i have older stuff in the back and new stuff in the front. so if it is popular that day you may get something older .
it is always busy but they have good prices and they are well stocked.  i go here if i dont have time to run into frys, my other goto grocery store.
located on las vegas blvd just south of the famous las vegas strip. if its harley davidson related they have it. this place is quite the spectacle, i have no idea what the experience is for the serious harley enthusiast but for the average person it is quite impressive and massive. it is worth a stop in just to say that you did.  live it up you are in las vegas for cryin out loud!
i know good boba shops, i lived in california practically my whole life so i know good bobatea. now, usually good boba tea shops are owned by asians  not being racist, but they got the flavor profiles and textures down right statistically. i have a feeling this is definitely a local american run company. its located in the san tan mall across forever 21 near the harkins theater.  the design is like a beehive: black and yellow color themed and honey comb designs. the reason for that is because they carry honey boba, which is really delicious. boba is a chewy tapioca pearl that is offered to be included in the bottom of your drink, among many other toppings jellyfruitpoppers. boba is very hard to control quality wise for a business because you have to cook it just right for the chewiness and let it sit in a honeysugar syrup but not for too long or itll start to break down.the menu may be confusing to some, but just ask the girls for suggestions. go on facebook ahead to look at their menu. never tried any of their drink toppings? ask for a sample.ive tried a couple of their drinks, and i have a few suggestions. for the blended drinks, try not to add too much ice or it becomes too chunky and not as creamy as a blended drink should feel. for example, the tropical island blended drink: the flavor profilewas very good: not too sweet, but too much ice killed the drink because it became more of a slush. i waited for the drink to thaw a bit and liquify and it was definitely a lot better with most of the ice out of the way. thai iced tea for me is a hit or miss: i usually use that drink to tell whether a boba place is legit or not. it was good, the ratio between tea and cream was perfect. my only gripe was i ordered a large size and paid over 5.00 but didnt get it filled to the top. boba was perfect consistency though.customer service was great, there wasnt much to say except that i felt bad for the three girls who were working. it was super busy and i felt they could have used an extra hand or something to not feel as overwhelmed. they were super nice and took the time to say welcome to fat straw! every time someone came in the door. poor girls were working super hard to get everyones drinks out in a timely manner while trying to take orders and answer questions. the packaging of the drinks is a bit funny. the diameter of the drink cups are as wide as a donut, how am i supposed to put my drinks in the cipher of my car? all in all, its not really a bad boba tea shop. a bit pricey but a good place to chill free wifi and have a sip of something cold on a hot summers day.
great new find! little over a month old and i can tell they will explode in customers. the quality of their drinks are definitely cali quality. everything is all precisely measured to maintain top quality flavor and texture. they have a huge menu selection which can be a bit too much to look through if your new to the place, be sure to check out their facebook page for a complete menu before. if you like vanilla bean and almond flavor i recommend the snow bowl. the honey boba was also perfect from start to finish of the drink; in other words they remained soft and chewy till the end. ive had drinks from other places where the boba would become really cold and hard towards the end.man just writing this makes me crave to go and get a cup; its too bad that its nearly midnight as i type this, also the fact that its quite a drive from chandler. only issue i have really is the price over 5 for the largest size! then again thats your typical price for a grande size of starbucks fraps so it balances out. the price inflation is real! i suppose it has to do with the whole minimum wage issue. anyways, overall i will recommend this place! hopefully they get those loyalty punch cards soon. im losing valuable stamps!
great boba!
this shop is tucked away in the backside of san tan mall closer to the movie theater. ive been here a few times now, and the drinks have been consistently good. for those expecting half and half tea house its not quite there, but for se gilbert, its pretty damn good. the ladies working the counter have always been nice.  ive listened to them explain the drinks to customers who didnt quite know what boba was, even gave them a sample of honey boba to try before they ordered it. if you want to try something cold and that is not another starbucks, i would say give them a shot. ill for sure be back.
i have mixed feelings about this place. coming from california its hard to compare any other boba teas. ive been here 3 times and tried something new each time. the menu is pretty confusing. i found some of the drinks too sweet for my liking but overall the quality is good and i will come back! the staff is really friendly and helpful too.
i love the machacha and the cali girl with boba. not a fan of popping boba which are filled with different flavor ...ask them for a sample...and they pop in your mouth when you munch on them. their boba is very soft and gummy which i love it that way. the regular boba milk tea and the white teas are great. their small is a mini but it is big; the regular is like super big.
super americanized boba tea joint. i appreciate the blended drink options.  my husband got the almond vanilla blended and it was delish. i got the mactacha iced milk tea, it had the authentic matcha milk tea flavor but was a bit on the weak side whereas my husbands was full flavor. the boba was prepared well. they call their boba honey boba its just regular boba prepared the way boba is for milk tea, i assume they describe it this way for the novice boba tea drinkers.  we also had a taster of the cali girl which was fruity  tasty.besides my drink being on the weak side, my only other complaint would be their cup shape. its basically a fro yo bowl shape.overall a great spot to grab a drink at san tan, happy to have a local boba spot!
very cute place! i like the cute decor and vibe of this place. place is a bit tiny and tight but not too bad. good place to just hang out. we came in and they were just about out of everything lol... no coffee no thai tea, no boba... but we tried the fruity drinks. forgot what they were called but they had the popping boba and it tasted real fresh and fruity. i definitely would recommend this place. it is a bit pricey but its not too bad. overall pretty good.
fat straw has the best boba drinks in the east valley. after coming back to arizona from la, i had such a difficult time finding boba that was good enough in comparison to the amazing boba houses in la. fat straw does a great job. the boba is soft and chewy but not overcooked to the point of being mushy. i also love the cute, stubby,  little cups; they add a unique element to fat straw. although the menu is diverse with lots of drink mixes and topping options, the speciality drinks are all too sweet for me. if they allow sugarsyrup customization, it might be perfect.
great location! love the outside eating area. got my drink fast, friendly staff, and will come here again!
i really liked chez dallaire. i popped in here for a couple of drinks with a good friend who lives really close to this bar. it seems like they have not been open very long, and they are currently applying for a licence to allow drinks outside...so for now, you need to grab a seat in one of the comfy booths, rather than taking your drinks out.they have a few pretty standard drinks on tap, and a whole wall full of liquor, so i assume they can make cocktails as well. it looks like a clean, friendly london pub to me...until you reach the back wall where they have a deer mounted onto the wall! the staff were all really friendly and it wasnt too pricy  whats not to like!?
let me begin by admitting that i somewhat biased when it come to this review. chez dallaire is just a couple of minutes walk from my house and there is currently no other establishment to of this kind that can meet this criteria. so with that disclosure out of the way let me proceed. chez dallarie opened its doors in pointe saint charles over the summer and offer a hipster type vibe in a nicely renovated atmosphere. yes, you will see lots of shaggy beards here! when they opened they didnt have a sign for the longest time, but i recently noticed that a sign has been put up so im hoping that this is means that they are here to stay. chez dallaire, offer everything that you would be looking for in a local watering hole of a slightly upscale nature. they have a good selection of beers and things to eat and snack on ranging from macn cheese to nachos and tvs to watch the hockey game. one warning for the non eaters of meat out there, the menu is geared towards the carnivorous. im a big fan what can i say! did i mention that it is around the corner from my place?
a new mexican restaurant opened in our neighborhood replacing the shuttered restaurante guadalajara which only lasted about 6 months.  we were not to hungry as we had a late lunch so we both choose the taquitos from the app menu at 7.99.  we were brought some chips and salsa and bean dip.  chips were standard restaurant style, nothing special and the bean dip could have used some more flavor.  salsa was ok but, we asked if they had a hotter salsa and they brought us that which was quite an improvement over the other one.we were surprised when they brought us out the fideo soup when we just ordered an appetizer.  the soup had a great flavor full of noodles and a delicious broth.  our apps came and it was 4 taquiitos cut in half on a plate of diced greens and onions with sour cream and guac in the middle of the plate.they also brought us a small complimentary toreados  1 sliced grilled chili and onions.  that was more than enough for both of us and we were full and happy.service was top notch and very friendly as they kept the drink glasses full and removed unused plates as needed.  our bill was 22.50  a 5.00 tip.it turns out we know the owner from the local michoacan chain and he informed us him and his family opened this restaurant.we wish them the best of luck and they will be seeing more of us soon as there were a couple items on the menu we want to try, especially the shrimp filled toreados.good luck guys!the three amigos
service was excellent and viri, our waitress, was gracious and very sweet!! she suggested we try their la michoacana margarita and im so glad we did, will definitely be coming back here.
the food was delicious and fresh. the salsa and bean dip was great. the fideo soup was like home made. the waiter was kind and polite. the only thing thats was not too good was the coffee. it was cold. the prices are ok. good place for some good mexican food.
just went for the byobm bar make your own bloody mary bar and it was awesome!!! so many toppings and different flavors of vodka!
fun location, looking for a identity. the food and service were great, the bloody mary bar was fabulous. the dj in my opinion was a little out of place but just an opinion.
great service. very warm in the restaurant. the only complaint i have is that the warm biscuit that they serve with the meal was cold and rock hard. i had to ask for some jam to put on it and no butter was offered. other than that, the food was excellent and came out hot. the italian coffee is wonderful. looked over the bloody mary bar and wow, certain family members and friends are going to love it!
ive been here twice with my fiance and both times were quite good. weve split several of the hashes and the benedicts. i have to say that the smoked brisket was the winner out of all the dishes ive tried. the cornbread was just sweet enough to counter the smoke and salt of the brisket and also to balance out the green chili. another favorite was the fried chicken hash although was a little over cooked and overall ate a little dry. the eggs benedict was just ok and not overly impressed with the hollandaise. lastly we had the crab skillet with old bay aioli which again was just ok. crab was good but could have been fresher. the sauce sold the dish, delicious. lastly, the bloody mary bar... big fan. any excuse to stick as much goodness into a morning cockatail as i can fit!  the flavored vodkas were delicious, especially the cilantro lime and they dont skimp on it;. also tried a bloody without the bells and whistles of the buffet style build it your way and it was still equally delicious and less work. i highly recommend hash kitchen if only for a morning cocktail and some good hangover chow.
my wife and i chose the hash kitchen in part because of previous reviews and in part because they serve french press coffee.   i had the lump crab   sweet potato hash.   it was excellent.   my wife had the spanish fritata.   she said it was good,  but not great.   the french press coffee was really good and an ample serving.   service was very good.   candice was pleasant and attentive.   recommended for breakfast.
i met a coworker here for lunch last week and opted to enjoy their breakfast menu.  the chorizo and mushroom sweet potato hash with sunny side up eggs and a side of fruit was perfect.  our server was great and didnt seem to mind that we were special ordering off of the menu.  the atmosphere is nice, the staff is very welcoming and the food is top notch too.
came here for a brunch bday party!!!  they accommodated our party of 15.  love the service and attention we got from the staff.  never had to ask for a refill.  since a few of us were early, the special menu caught my eye....bacon donuts???  say it isnt so!  i had to order it.  it is freshly made, a little chewysoft but i like, and very fcking awesome.  ouch i need to work out an extra day to burn this off!!!  and of course, got the herb chicken and waffles since i blew the diet plan anyways.  the waffles was good, but i did not taste the vanilla.  the chicken was ok, i did not taste enough flavors.  it was covered by the fried onions on top.  overall, it was a great time, great service, and good food!
great service  food! they were so accommodating to our large group. i would definitely come again!
upscale breakfast brunch spot. nice hotel like atmosphere.  creative menu executed well in slow weekday morning. great biscuit and superb coffee. need to work on potatoes. need to be hotter, fresh off grill  service by waiter very good but floor management lacking,  l will come back to try the waffle.
bye bye cuttlefish, hello the hash!  we had a group of 15 for a sunday birthday brunch. i have called 2 weeks ahead to reserve a table.  they dont normally accept reservations but only for big groups. i arrived early to drop off the cake and was told my reservation wasnt there.  i was a little stunned, but they were really accommodating to fit our party. i sure missed those motorcycle bike seats at the oyster bar when it was cuttlefish. they took them out and replaced with a diy bloody mary bar.  at 7, you get to customize however you like it.  i guess the v8 juice wasnt bad either for the nondrinkers.  who doesnt like slim jims? the slim jims added the special kick in the drink plus made a great snack while waiting for our entrees. herb chicken and waffles were popular among our table. i tried something different and went with the herb chicken egg benedict. my herb chicken was amazingly good. jl had the same chicken but hers wasnt that great. they must have made a different batch. we probably ordered all their herb chickens for that day.  as for the egg benedict, nothing too special. the hollandaise sauce might need a little work. it was really bland.  for the coffee fans, must try the french press. one of the better quality coffee blends a brunch place. it was so rich and smooth. i think i probably drank 12 of the pot. so good!  the staff provided exceptional level of service. they kept our water and coffee filled at all times. when it was time for the cake, i believe it was the owner that went around the table and handed us with a new plate. he even brought and lighted the many candles on the cake.  another scrumptious brunch place big enough space to have a large group. they even have a live dj by the bar area. i believe it ends at 1pm. i dont know if this location was cursed or what, but hopefully, this place can hold on and stick around a little longer.
fairy decent mix of older people and scottsdale yuppies at around noon sunday brunch, but lets hope this place can avoid turning into r and r down the road. they might be angling for that crowd by cramming a dj into the main dining room. we sat further away from the tunes, so it did not bother us, but the dude was too close to the door and should be moved. the bloody mary bar was interesting as you get a fresh made bloody and your choice of 5 vodkas and spice level. the other 30 things on that bar are all for bling and range from the normal celery and bacon to the weird of cheese and salami and bacon sticks slim jims. i liked my drink and for one time, it is a good talking piece for your meal.     lemon ricotta pancakes were light and airy, but it was the maple syrup reduction concoction that really gave these cakes some life. the breakfast burro contained runny eggs its on the menu, not scrambled as normal. not my thing, but it rated high with my companion. not sure if this place can crack the big three breakfast joints, but it was a good meal. the same dude owns the bbq joint next door, so if the concept isnt working he will just invent another concept until he hits it on the head, but so far he has a winner.
this place was quite good. they have a fun bloody mary bar where you can build your own. only negative is the music is a little loud. makes it seem a little clubby for a sunday morning breakfast.
just wanted to update my rating of hash kitchen.  i received a note from hks owner, joey m., who apologized for the mishap concerning my chicken  waffle togo order and offered a complimentary cw should i return.  my first visit was for thanksgiving brunch, and i wanted to do an update, so i brought mom with me for her first visit and my second on 121015.  i wanted to dine at the wide whitemarbled bar, but my mom favors booths... thank goodness we were lucky enough to get a great server named candace, because her friendliness and service made up for the small table space we had after all of our entrees arrived!we ordered two cappuccinos, the coconutalmond french toast of course!, http:www.yelp.combiz_photosthehashkitchenscottsdale?selectamb8tgvrgkpkakkjy9wfqg the complimentary cw, http:www.yelp.combiz_photosthehashkitchenscottsdale?selectwpwsytayvtfnbqsv25aoa and an item on the december specials menu gingerbread pancakes! http:www.yelp.combiz_photosthehashkitchenscottsdale?selectqoqgj_mwzjgrggwqnxauag  this came with a dollop of cream cheese frosting and topped with gingerbread cookie crumble.  loved that the frosting didnt contain powdered sugar in it and wasnt too sweet.  i am all about textures, so i loved the cakeyness of the pancakes and the differentsized crumbles of the cookies, which had a wonderful gingerbread flavor and essence to them.  slathering on the cream cheese frosting, which id say almost had a butter consistency, gave the pancakes a creamy component.  my mouth, nose, and brain were happy!  mom really enjoyed the french toast, which surprised the both of us, because she doesnt care for coconut!  well, that cant be true, because she loves to make ginataan, a dessert consisting of different tubers, plantains, and rice cakepatties stewed in sweetened coconut milk.  its more accurate to say she doesnt like coconut aroma in healthbeauty products, such as shampoos and lotions.  well, she had two french toast halves, as well as a quarter waffle and a third of the two large fried chicken breast patties in our entree.  mom said there were three!  i might agree all i know is that i had at least three times the amount of fried chicken breast that i received on my first visit.  while i thoroughly enjoyed this visits version of french toast, this was different from the first, which i felt was a little more tender, less caramelized.  i loved both versions!  if my future visits are as delightful as these two were, i feel like i could rate this breakfast eatery five stars!  service is always friendly, and i havent felt any negative vibes whenever i inquire about certain ingredients in entrees.  i do feel that hk could improve their mochas in their coffee menu by offering a higherend chocolate product than the standard chocolate syrup which contains corn syrup.  mom did enjoy the mocha she had in lieu of the cappuccino that she didnt like, but shes not as picky about ingredients as i am.  i thank the owner joey m. and gm linda rossow, who both came out and met us.  well, i asked if the owner was around, since he asked me to look for him the next time i visited.  they were friendly and warm, and i could tell that they really liked what they have created with thk.  linda told us about the bbq place next door, which replaced notorious burgers.  mom and i will have to try the brisket soon!
so, i have a confession: im absolutely obsessed with bbt ballpark. i could just sit in that empty stadium and hang out all day staring at the view. that being said, imagine my excitement when i first heard about a beer festival being held there. by far, my favorite thing about this festival was the lay out and footprint. they grouped the breweries and bottle shops by regions charlotte, western north carolina, triad, and the triangle. i thought this was a really cool way to do this. the festival wasnt on the field, but up where the concession stands are. why is this huge? because this means the festival was for the most part covered. and we had some cloud burst type rain come through on this day, so it was nice to be dry. this is the first year of the festival, so there were obviously a few kinks. the checkin process for attendees was a little chaotic. there was also some confusion among the workers for the vip folks during the first hour. food was provided by the ballpark concession stands. i thought this was absolutely brilliant on the stadiums part. im a firm believer to eat before you come to one of these things, however i had to get a hot dog. come on, you cant come to the ballpark and not get a hot dog. it should also be covered in chili. parking: there are decks all around, but they are not free. i got a kick out of the one directly across the street. for first timers, you cant get back out of the entrance. i watched a whole bunch of really confused drunk people trying to leave and were trapped in a huge line. street parking is free on the weekends. may the odds be ever in your favor to try and score one of those spots. you know my motto folks, you shouldnt drive to a beer festival. get a dd. call uber. is the vip worth it? i try to answer this for every festival. imo, yes for this one. i felt like you get a lot and the extra 25 is completely worth it. im not sure if it will be the same next year, but for this first year you got to come in an hour early, use a private air conditioned lounge, private bathrooms, special beers not available to ga, and a parting gift. i believe the gift this year was beer to take home. im excited to see this festival really take off next year. kudos to everyone involved.
we gave the place a shot and my kids really enjoyed the yogurt. they have a wide selection and toppings to pick from. we went early so it was empty. it will be a special treat for them as it is costly with kids as all is done by weight.  will go back for another treat in the future.
a few weeks ago i googled lululemon outlets on a whim to see where the few chosen locations in the country were. i figured my best bet to catch one would be on a future road trip out to california or something. imagine my immediate heart attack when i saw lululemon westgate opening soon...what!you better believe i hauled my cookies way out yonder to check out the location. theres not many things that prompt me to drive 40 minutes to glendale, but yes, the lulu outlet is definitely one of them.i love that its organized by size. makes hunting down your styles super easy. ive read a few people on their facebook complaining about the selection of shorts, but i thought they easily made up for it in the pants section, at least in the 6 and 8 sections i fall into. employees were super friendly as usual. if anything, id say the store went a little overboard in stocking outerwear, but im sure they cant pick and choose what they receive from hqs we made too much. not necessarily a huge need in the valley, but i can see how this would be an insane find for people visiting from colder climates.i walked out with a pair of fulllength wunder unders and two tanks for about 60 less than ive paid for at a regular lulu. absolutely worth the trek! yay!
ive been renting from orange realty now for almost 2 years, and i have nothing but great things to say about them.  its good to know that there is still good management companies out there. ones that treat tenants with care, respect, and high regards! we all know there are not too many creditable property management  companies out there, so if you want to leave the gambling inside the casinos and not with your next property management company, choose orange realty. with professional staff members like blanca, and my personal favorite adam, they are a sure win, and you will not be disappointed!
the course was in very good shape and a good challenge.  the outside service staff was a little too relaxed and even a little condescending from the moment we got there.  the restaurant and golf shop staff were very pleasant though.  the concessions were cheap and the round was reasonable as well.  if you are passing through the town and looking for a game, this is a good place to stop.
course is very demanding. either you hit it straight or you are in trouble i lost 5 balls. tie boxes and greens are in great shape, only issue is fare way out of boundary markers need up keep. restaurant staff is remarkable, pro shop was too relaxed and seemed on the onfence to any remark made. we where informed they would close at 4pm, arrived at 3:20 with the entire complex locked up and no one im sight.i called the next day to insure the golf cart was taken that night.
watched this show inside planet hollywood with my friend its a small theater compared to other shows on the strip but it made it nice that everyone got a close seat to the stage. the show also included some comedy and magic tricks in between sets, the playlist through out the show was definitely sexy. we both enjoyed the show very much.
we were looking for a burlesque show and came upon crazy girls.  this is one of the oldest burlesque show on the strip.  the venue is pretty small so it is a more intimate experience.  the girls come out into the audience during various dance numbers and get you involved.  i was not sure what to expect but did enjoy the show.  a couple times during the show, tony douglas comes out and does some cheezy magiccomedy acts although he is quite entertaining.  the girls are all in very good shape.  they do not have a huge production budget but they do a great job for what they have.  i would see this again, not overly priced and quite entertaining.
this patio is one of the best in kw, overlooking the water at victoria park. my coworkers and i often come here for a drink and its a nice escape. for food, i got an order of the wings when i went earlier this week and they werent that great... hot wings were sauce or any spice at all! will stick to drinks here :
wow the couchon sandwich .. bacon, pork belly and pulled pork .. been around the world and thats a sandwich , job well done guys ...
went for tuesday comedy night with my girlfriend and had a great time! on top of hearing some good comedians, we loved the fish taco tuesday special...will definitely make it back here again
the burger factory!i usually order the swiss mushroom burger or the bacon burger with fries and a drink and its always under 9. the bacon on the burger could be better but the mushrooms on the swiss burger are delicious. i have gotten them with onion rings before and sweet potatoe fries and i approve them all! the onion rings could debatably be the best ones i have had. the owner isahbell is so sweet and knows customer service, she is very passionate about her restaurant in the food court and is excited when she is launching new food. for instance she just added hot wings and yes they are actually hot and fresh! but when you order the wings call them in because they take 15 minutes  just like any other wing place. i put 4 stars here because when i come to the mall i only eat here now, but i wouldnt drive to the mall just for it.
ok so i decided to give this place a second try and so far so good.  the was an employee actually at the front stand today and she was nice.  as most of you all know i am the king of burgers.  the burger was ok.....to much bread for my taste
i would definitely recommend coyote plumbing.  i had another company offer a really pricey bid on what i thought was a simple job to fix my clogged sink.  my mom referred me to coyote for another estimate and not only did they do the same job, just as effectively, just as friendly of a tech, but they charged me 200 less than the other guys estimate.  simple and painless, just how it should be!
i have used coyote on 2 separate occasions. both times they were quick to show up to do the job. i gave them 4 stars only because the first time they came to fix a toilet leak, they had to come back the following day as it was still leaking. i was happy that they stand behind their work and didnt charge me for the second visit, although missing a second day of work was a bit of an inconvienence. overall, i would recommend coyote and would call them again if the need were to arise.
we used coyote plumbing to replace a broken tub faucet. it took several tries to get the company to call us back but that is my only complaint. the plumber that showed up did a great job and really knew what he was doing.
superb setting. tasty and classy food. noisy but thats what one expects in such a lively place. service is quick and efficient. had the beef tartare which was excellent. cocktails are also nicely prepared.
family and i passed by here after dinner for some more drinks. we had a couple youngins with us so we couldnt exactly go to a bar. decided to try cafe du nouveau monde and it was pretty great. lots of drinks on the menu and plenty of beers on tap. i was also able to steal some bites of the creme brulee which was amazing.
starting off on a leisurely drive on a sunday afternnon, i never made it out of town when i saw dane countys newest brew pubmicrobrewry was open. hop haus brewing opened their doors on 624 and has had a steady stream of traffic ever since.their initial offerings include four wideranging types of beer. get the flight for 9 and you get all four flavors plus your choice of one of the guest beers they carry from wi brewing co. also in verona, vintage brewing, or karben4. three more propietary beers are on tap in the next two to three weeks. i really liked the allegedly albino pale ale and the deuce deuce porter. on opposite ends of the beer spectrum, the first had a great full bodied flavor for a lighter beer while the latter had great notes of coffee with just an ever so light finish of chocolate to smooth things out. the wildcat amber ale a nod to verona high schools mascot has a good citrus note to it. the el andy ipa was o.k. but for me, wasnt a standout. what really tickled me was the budweiser tap pull....which is what they use for their tap water. macrobrewery.....take that!!the facility itself, while a bit austere right now, is still being worked. the bar and walls are all reclaimed barn wood from down the road on cty. m and corrugated metal. very nonpretentious, very green, and sure to be well accented in short order.hop haus also offers 6 types of wine, nonalcoholic beverages, and some basic food offerings. pizza from frabonis and curts gourmet popcorn. on this day, freeman bros. bbq food cart was parked in the lot to augment their menu. the plan is to have a food cart in the lot everyday during the summer. hop haus opens at 3 during the week and carts will be set up about 5 and about noon on sundays. they have a full calendar of cart signups already. check their website for the cart schedule. hophausbrewing.com there is limted parking, which would be my biggest concern on its longterm viability but being right on main st. in verona, and right next to the military ridge bike trail, the place will be worth the parking pains and a great spot to quench a thirst!
drove past the location a couple of weeks prior and wanted to check it out.   glad we made it back and we enjoyed a flight of their beers and was not disappointed.   i will make it back
they have been a great addition to verona and the craft beer scene around madison.the beers are on a constant rotated basis at the bar, and ive been pleased each time i went. their afternoon dlight is outstanding, like have a single pint and need to buy a growler that day good.
after mother nature rained on our plans for hosting a uye at a yelpers house, bill b from verona launched plan b and reached out to hop haus with the hope that they would host our uye. they agreed, and before i knew it, i was on my way to this young nanobrewery. not a lot of parking in the lot directly in front of the facility facility is part of a small strip mall the strip mall is new and quite nice hop haus did an awesome job of making the inside of the facility look like a fullscale brew haus plenty of seating inside love the look of the polished concrete, retro barnwood, and tin a bit noisy inside due to all of the hard surfaces awesome bathrooms friendly staff  very accommodating and helpful super reasonable prices for brews approximately 45 hop haus offerings on tap tasting flights were generous guest taps were interesting and rounded out the menu they offer frabonis pizzas for foodi really liked the peace train pale ale. im a sucker for a good apa, even more so if it has a reasonable abv, and peace train came in at 5.4 which is awesome. truly an outstanding apa.i wish they werent located 18 miles from my house 40minutes by way of the beltline, otherwise id have a bar stool here with my name engraved on it.
i ended up at hop haus under some unusual circumstances. my plan had been to attend a potluck out on some land outside of verona, but of course mother nature decided she wanted run of the place and nixed any chance of us being outside by throwing heavy ran and a tornado watch our way. she must have been annoyed we didnt formally invite her to the party. sorry, gosh.one of our group members had previously enjoyed his time at hh, so he gave them a call the day before our party when the rain was just a threat to see if theyd be willing to let us bring our food in and take over half the place. they were totally down, and were still amenable the next day when the threat became a reality. the staff was kind, there were plenty of tables, and as promised they had no issue with us setting up our spread. i dont know if bringing in outside food is something they regularly allow, but i appreciate them helping us out in a pinch! unfortunately, the beer menu that night didnt particularly appeal to me, but thats just a matter of preference. i also wasnt super fond of having to walk in the rain to get there  the parking options are quite limited on site, and the side road that abuts hop haus doesnt offer any parking options. on a nice day, though, this wouldnt be an issue.thanks again to the staff for taking us in! i think they made fans of a lot of us!
twenty flavors of thirty ice cream, pickles and lots of water.eight inside water filling stations.interior design center for all your home remodeling.we had single scoops of blueberry cheesecake and chocolate malt ball. 1.70 or 4.00 a whole cup the ice cream was good and i looked at lots of interesting tiles, fixtures and flooring.i think its great that this unique store opened! the poseidon filtration systems store, thrifty ice cream and dk kitchen are sort of all connected but are also separate businesses.thrifty ice cream is a bare bones kind of ice cream shop. no tables but you are welcome to sit at the counter at dk kitchen. the four stars is a stretch but hey they are the only ice cream shop in the area and im happy its not yogurt.
you had me at thrifty ice cream!i grew up in california and i all i knew was the cheap ice cream at thrifty, now rite aid.  the prices have steadily increased over the years, but it is still a bargain!  the creaminess of the ice cream and the various flavors i grew up over the years brings me back to my childhood.  now, living in arizona, there are zero rite aids, which means i cannot get my thrifty ice cream fix.  ive only found thrifty ice cream at mom  pop water shops, which i am totally grateful for.  this place has 20 flavors which is a lot more than other water shops i have frequented.  definitely that alone deserves 4 stars in my book!
great retail shop that also offers psychic services. decent selection of gemstones at mostly reasonable prices, they have some really pretty jewelry. ive been going here for a few years and it has a chill atmosphere not hippienew age, reeking of patchouli. ive seen lori for yearly tarot readings and she always blows me away. shes extremely specific on the details, no broad statements or warnings. ex  she doesnt say dont speed youll get a ticket, she says watch your speed for the next 3 weeks. shes said several extremely accurate things that ended up happening, including medical issues with family members. when shes right, shes dead on, but ill admit shes running at maybe 50 accuracy for me. i hadnt been there in a couple years nd recently went in for a reading with a random person because lori had left and they claimed not to know where she went. the reading was sort of a waste of 40  i wasnt feeling the person at all. she was nice, but pretty scattered with all the random things shed throw out and she didnt really elaborate on anything. 30 min was always enough time for a general read then specific questions with lori, but ran out of time with this new one. 4 stars for the store, but i only ever went there because of lori and i likely wont be back since shes gone. thankfully i searched online and found loris office, so yay!
i had a great experience at this repair shop. staff, especially virgil, were friendly and apparently honest!!!  they couldnt get the bolt off my tire rod so the alignment they tried to complete was done at no charge.  the interior of the waiting area is as comfortable as home coffee, soda, water and wifi are included in your visit.  theres even a play area for kids!!  conveniently  located, i think ive found my auto care store.   thanks honest1.
new place, we apparently went to the grand opening and overall the sushi was pretty yummy. prices are pretty typical for ayce, and they were able to do half rolls so that was good. they had a grand opening promo where if you checked in on fb or twitter you got to draw out a paper that gave you a free drink or even a bottle of wine, so that was nice though im not a big wine drinker. service was very attentive and the staff was friendly. i think well return and try more things.
was there last night for dinner. walked in and was surprised at the atmosphere. it was very nice and and quaint. although i was quite cold because they kept the place pretty chilly. we opted for the ayce option which was more than worth it. they have a couple of interesting appetizers that we tried. one of the was the monkey brain or something to that effect. it was like tempura fried avocado but it was tasty. sushi was unique and fresh. i had the red tiger roll and the baja roll. red tiger was a spicier version of a typical tiger roll. the baja was a play on a special roll with addition of cilantro. also tried the coco salmon roll which was interesting and almost sweet. ended with a dish they called honey toast. it was tasty but only if it was warm because thats what i expected. service was good granted we were the only ones in the place at a point. i would go back because i felt the ayce was a good value for what they offered.
minimal decor  i particularly like their shrimp poppers  sushi bomb rollservice was quick since it was in the middle of the day during a wednesday afternoon. i guess my only thing i wasnt too happy about was that there was quite a few items on the acye lunch menu that was restricted to only dinner  only one order person. the chef came by and checked on us during our lunch as well.will return in the future for dinner
the owner, andy came and talked to my table and was very friendly. it is a pretty reasonably priced ayce, especially for the quality of sushi you get. the honey toast desert is delicious.
the sushi was average, i also felt the list of rolls was much smaller than other sushi places ive eaten at. nothing really stuck out here to me, but it was a pleasant experience.
this place is good. i like the decor and the wait staff were super nice. i ordered ayce and i can say they do not dissapoint. i got all of my usual nigiri favorites along with the fresh uni and softshell crab tempura and hamachi kama. quality wise, hanabi can be comparable to a place like oishi sushi also on sahara or even naka sushi, on lake mead and rampart. nothing spectacular, but a solid neighborhood sushi spot that has tasty good quality fish and friendly warm service. it is, when in proximity, the goto place to raise your blood sugar to the gods, especially when stranded in a crazy random and ridiculous flash flood.
i havent done the all you can eat yet, but for 28 i will definitely be back to try it. i had salmon, eel and tuna sushi and was impressed by all of it. very high quality fish. the eel was especially good. it was my favorite of all three. its not the cheapest sushi, but you get what you pay for here. its better quality than any of the cheaper options. the service was very attentive, but not over bearing. great atmosphere and very comfortable.
my family and i went to hanabi and it was pretty fantastic. the sushi was greatfresh and there wasnt a lack of options. there were even a few new rolls that ive never heard of like the coco shrimp roll i believe thats what its called. the coco shrimp roll was super creative in my opinion, and i wouldve never thought of having coconut shrimp in a sushi roll it was a great combination by the way.the waitress was really nice too. she was really helpful on informing my family and i about the menu. plus the honey toast and green tea ice cream mochi was really awesome.the only reason this was a four instead of a five star was because a few dishes were just okay in a sense. the sushi, sweets, and service was amazing. but just a few of the dishes hot dishes were okay nothing too outstanding about them.but either way 45 would go again.
four stars are for the food and decor. service was good with two waitstaff.i dont think i will be going back due to loud japanese rap music blaring from speakers throughout restaurant.place is exceptionally clean with a simple, nice feel. tables and benches are hardwood which is a little tough on your rear end.
food: my family did the ayce at 2 in the afternoon, all the selections that we did were very good, this a great go to spot if we are craving for japanese. they also have wagyu selections which  did not try. there are some variations that are new which is typical some combinations worked really well.ambiance: great quiet place although if dining with a big party it would not be advisable the area is small so the noise might affect other diners. definitely a great neighborhood japanese restaurant. service: very attentive, and was very accommodating with my family.overall: would definitely come back and try other dishes on their menu.
great ayce deal! fish is fresh, dishes are fun, service at the bar was attentive. as other reviews state, the ayce dinner price is 28, which is slightly higher than the local average. however, quality here is among the best ayce ive had and the majority of lowerpriced businesses in town have significantly lower quality to match.appetizers: this was our favorite section of the menu. the jalapeno popper dish that is commonly found around town was nicely presented here and actually had a good kick of spice for once! salmon poke had a great spicy chili sauce, both were offset by the seaweed salad. we really enjoyed the grilled mackerel and the soft shell crab, but i did not care for the oysters. the real standout was the rock n roll appetizer, which is a riceless roll! nigiri: nigiri selection was ample, and fish was typically pretty fresh. the super white tuna, scallop, golden eel, and squid were good options, but i felt the salmon and yellowtail werent that great and lacked flavor. rice was an average portion, fish was cut on the thin side.rolls: we tried the twilight roll and the white dragon roll, both had several sauces and fishes, both were tempurashrimp based. i generally try to be more adventurous with my roll picks but by this point i was too full to care. rolls were solid and they had a lot of new specialty options, but i wish they had more riceless options.the space was another sushi spot before hanabi took over, but the modern, clean decor and chalkboard specials menu are a bit different. service at the bar was attentive and we were frequently checked on by both chefs and management, though our empty dishes stacked up this didnt really bother me, as they were pretty busy.for those who are outraged by the higher ayce price here if 3 is really a deal breaker for you to drop your rating over, you have no business coming here. stick to the dollar menu. the quality of dishes, freshness of fishes, and variety on the menu are more than enough to warrant the difference in cost.tip: follow them on social media for a 50 off coupon for november  december for a la carte orders good lunch option.
first time doing an ayce. the variety is very good. all the rolls were great. the andy was our favorite. fried rice a bit too greasy for my taste.   service was spotty. one server was on top of it, the other not so much. overall, really good value and variety. we will return.
pretty good selection.  its an outlet, so i had to do some searching,  ended up finding a pretty great rug. i picked up some really nice towels too. really made my guest bathroom look like a high end resort style bathroom.  ive always wanted to order from the frontgate catalog,  but didnt like the prices. this may make me try it out!
outlet....key word! great place to check out if your looking for frontgate items at greatly reduced prices. its a treasure seekers place to shop, some scratch and dents, but i found a couple of things i didnt know i needed at 60 off the catalogue price.
had no idea this place was here until my husband and i drove by the other day.  i said to myself, self, need to stop in and check it out.  i am sure glad i did!  i do like things from frontgate to begin with so even better this place is around.  as some of the other comments mentioned there are things that are damaged in some way, aka, truly an outlet store that gets damaged and or returned items from the original buyers at frontgate however depending on what youre looking for or not looking at all, i am sure you can find something!  great prices as i happened to be there when all outdoor furniture was 75 off.  ended up spending 1000 dollars on a 3 piece set when i wouldve easily paid more than 5,6k for it!!  and best part of all was it wasnt damaged at all!!!!!  so, again happy to have found this place when i did.  i would certainly recommend this place to anybody i know.  you never know what you will find.  oh, and if you are looking for bar stools, omg this is the place as they have a huge selection on them. gayle helped us and she was wonderful!  thank you!!  usually dont comment much on yelp but felt with some of the other comments i needed to share the good word.  so, good luck in your outlet adventure.
we went the grand opening day afternoon.i tried the hotdog with everything. around 3  pretty decent price and good portion of food. i am impressed by the fresh ingredients. every bite is very flavorful. saw mr dick portillo walk by in a purple shirt. may god bless him and open more awesome restaurants.
it was okay. the environment was awesome but the food well... meh. it is definitely a hot dog place because their chili dog was on point. good place to bring your family to.
so with all the hype in scottsdale another portillos has opened in tempe for us east valley peeps!all i can say is what a fun and sassy place it is! while we drove into the parking lot we saw some officers directing traffic which made it nice. once we were parked, we were impressed with all the outside seating with misters.... everyone knows its hot here!when we walked in we were overwhelmed with all the people and quickly realized that we needed to get in line to order. while we stood there a man came up and asked us if we were ready to order, and i said no since i hadnt even had a chance to look at the menu :? so he quickly got us a menu and we decided and got in line to be greeted by a wonderful young lady who tool our order on a bag! than we were handed our bag and headed to the line to check out. less than 5 second wait and we stepped into the pick up line.... daughter went to the salad line to get her salad :within approximately 4 minutes they called our random number for our food and off to the table we went!we all dug into our food!  i had the italian beef dipped!, with mozzarella and onions and a side of onion rings. hubby had the hot dog with mustard, yellow onion, and pickle, along with a combo beef and chargrilled sausage and a side of fries. dd got the garden salad, and ds got chicken tenders and fries....i enjoyed mine a lot! very flavorful. i do think the onion rings might need a different type of batter, just not the way i like them. hubby loved his completely! i think the fries could have been cooked or browned a little more  personal preference....dd loved her salad, very fresh!ds did not care for his chicken fingers :  next time i asked him to try something else :over all i think this is a great addition to the area. i had the opportunity to talk to sharon owner and saw dick portillo walking and mingling with guests. you can see they are taking a lot of pride int heir new establishment and i cant wait to come back to portillos!
my experience at this portillos was 10x better than at the n. scottsdale location. maybe they learned from that opening? but i found the quality to be much better. we must have missed the dinner rush because i quickly found a parking spot and there wasnt a wait to order. we walked in and they had some workers out in the ordering area taking preorders. i decided to try the italian beef sandwich and the boy got the italian sausage sandwich and a chili dog. we shared an order of fries. you order and then walk down the ways to wait for your order to be called. it took about 5 minutes to get our food fast  too fast? we got our condiments and dug in. i really liked my sandwich, get it with the hot peppers if youre into it. the fries were crisp and perfectly salted. my one complaint is that the sandwich was probably sitting so some of the bread was soggy. my bf thought the hot dog was okay. in my opinion all hot dogs are okay unless were talking about short leash so take that with a grain of salt. we ended with a chocolate cake shake that my boyfriend hadnt yet experienced the delights of  he tried to drink it all so thats that. ill be back
service, service, service. it is the star here. of course i expect that to change over time, no business is going to survive with 4 people working outside the drive thru or 2 people handing out menus to people as they walk in. food wise for chicago style dogs, italian beef, etc i would rather have locally owned lukes or taylor street with one exception, the chocolate cake shake is awesome but as i said the other food is just average, nothing outstanding.
this was my first time to eat at portillos. i got the beef sandwich with hot peppers and cheese fries as a side. the staff there is really nice and help direct you ever step of the ordering process. the food came out quickly and was correct. the first thing i noticed when opening up my sandwich is how greasy it was! that usually doesnt bother me but dang this sandwich was drenched! the paper it was wrapped in was even drenched. the sandwich tasted good and the peppers added some flavor. i wont be rushing back and dont understand what the hype was about, but in the future if i do return ill try out another item from the menu.
i came here tonight after hearing all of the hype over this place. i ordered the maxwell polish dog and my boyfriend got the beef sandwich. the food was extremely greasy. there was literally a pool of grease surrounding my hotdog. i wouldnt say that the food was bad, but it definitely was not as good as everyone had been raving about. overall the service was really friendly. store was run smoothly and was clean. but based on the food, i dont think i will be returning.
fast and friendly. got the dipped italian beef. great flavor, like i remember from chicagoland portillos. worth the the visit.unf, bun was much more soggy than i remember, almost dissolved. maybe theyre using different bread supplier here in az?food came out quickly, great job, but got the wrong drink. new location, new employees. understandable.will return and look fwd to seeing how this does here in az.
great place to check out when you are in the mood for some tasty chitown favorites. the tempe location has the same inside layout as their other scottsdale location. the bonus here is tempe marketplace is within walking distance. perfect when you need to work off some of those delicious calories.normally order the italian beef with both sweet and hot peppers and get it dipped. sometimes like to add cheese or even go big beef when im feeling unusually hungry. on other visits it is hard not to resist a few chi dogs with some cheese fries on the side. they even have a jumbo version of the dog. other selections include burgers, chicken, fish, veggie sandwiches and a nice selection of healthy salads.service is quick and friendly and your order shows up almost instantly at the next window. my only pet peeve is that the food is always wrapped up and put in a paper bag. lets just say the chili dogs and other items can get a little messy as they tackle each other in order to get a good home field advantage for the team. da bears!dont forget a piece of chocolate cake or one of their famous shakes before you leave. this place is fun and is definitely on my work time lunch rotation.new cubs spring training facility to open up right down the street. it is going to be packed with tons of people who enjoy great baseball and know how to eat. come in and give them a visit and tell them ... dip me baby and go cubbies!4.5 stars
portillos brings the taste of chicago to phoenix. the restaurant itself is a bit chaotic  theres several lines, and no matter what time of day you go, its busy. people huddle around the pick up counter, which can be irritating. on the upside, the food is cheap and tasty. i love the portillo hot dog  the toppings are awesome and the chilis are hot! the burgers and salads are pretty good, too. the poppyseed muffin is delicious  so soft, sweet, and tasty.give portillos a try when youre on a budget and have some patience. cheap  delicious  awesome.
everything is good at portillos! the chicago style dogs  great! burgers  great! italian beef sandwiches  great! they also have a whole lot more to choose from. prices are reasonable. update: went to portillos last night and went through the drive through. although they were not that busy it was 8pm it took 20 minutes to get my food  really portillos????? minus 1 star!!!
the combo is delicious! the char grilled italian sausage and the italian beef together is so mouth watering. prices arent too bad either. definitely coming back here!
look out calorie counters! for some tasty chicago style fast food, youve come to the right place. the set up seems exactly the same as the scottsdale location, which made navigating around the restaurant easy.options here include shakes, burgers, italian beef sandwiches, sausages and hot dogs. we split a big beef sandwich, onion rings, and a chocolate cake shake. the big beef had a heaping layer of beef on it, with extra gravybroth standard order, although you can modify it as you like. i usually like my italian beef full dip, but it was easier to eat it with less broth, and as you ate the sandwich, you would get different bites of broth soaked bread and unsoaked bread, making it kind of like you are eating 2 different sandwiches in one. i got it with hot and sweet peppers, and mozzarella, all blending well flavorwise with the sandwich.the onion rings had a very crunchy breading, and one order was a decent size. the chocolate cake shake was everything youd imagine it to be: thick, chocolatey, rich, with blended bits of chocolate cake in each sip. definitely a good way to ruin a diet!there is a spacious looking patio, and i saw people bringing their dogs here. since the weathers getting cooler, this might be a good option for dining on a patio with mans best friend.
good 60s style dinerrestaurant.. one odd thing they only have 2 kinds of hotdogs on the menu,  why its calling itself a hotdog joint i have no idea... the burgers are flame broiled and better than any fast food joint and they have an amazing number of salads on the menu, far more than they have hotdogs.. the fries and onion rings are pretty standard, they dont resemble hand made by any stretch i would put the place on par with a red robin experience and quality but no liquor or table side service great place before or after a asu game. shopping at tempe marketplace or movie at harkins
so i had heard so much about this place and was excited to see one had been built close to home. i headed over last weekend with no expectations. i saw the outside patio as i walked up and thought it would be nice to grab a bite when at tempe market place if the weather was not to hot. as i walked in i was impressed with everything on the walls. i enjoy looking at character type things like what they display. i jumped in line and was confused as how to order. they took the order of the person in front of me and then behind me but not mine. i had to ask what the process was but no biggie. i ordered the beef sandwich, cheese fries, onion rings, and chili. overall the food was decent. my fiance liked the chili and fries. we will return to try other things and check out the patio.
food is delicious  you get the feeling youre back home in chicago. will fit right in w the cubs new ball park opening down the street in 2014. plenty of menu choices for everyone, the portions are generous just not sure how healthy alot of the choices are. but they do have salads and other menu items if your concerned. there is also a drive throu for faster service the inside ordering process is easy and quick, they have multiple lines setup and plenty of people working behind the counter so your food comes out quick.
the italian beef sandwiches are the best in phoenix i found. also im not really a big fan of bell peppers but the sweet peppers they put on the sandwich here are really very good. i get my sandwiches dipped with an extra side of gravy on the side.
i had the chili dog and it was the best dog ever! chili was phenomenal. its huge and clean inside people that work there really nice willing to assist.
what a blast!it was packed, but they are ready for it! great selection of items.i had a hot beef sandwich ... awesome!customer service is great! missed jimmy buffet by 2 days!
just try it! move over teds. hot dogs, italian beef, chicken sandwiches and burgers...all good. oh and the cheese fries are a must add to any order. the only thing on the menu i didnt care for is the tamales...not worth the 3.
the food was great. i played it safe with a chicken sandwich and onion rings but next time im all in on the italian beef!
i had a bacon cheese burger w fries and it was great!!!! the wait to get my food was a bit longer than i expected but it was worth the wait. the burger was more than enough and the fries were tasty. the atmosphere was like an amusement park. everyone customeremployee were very pleasant. give it a try, i think you will enjoy it.
i had heard about portillos and even though i lived in chicago for a year or two, i had never tried it. i love italian beef sandwiches though, so i was pumped to try this place. that said, i wouldnt order the italian beef without the sausage. adding the sausage knocked the flavor several notches. i also tossed some cheese on there. it was great!i thought the fires were disappointing. i did however enjoy the set up and overall feel of the restaurant. id definitely go back. id like to try some of their other menu items. the options were quite extensive.
love the italian beef and onion rings.  i dont ever order anything else.  my family has gotten hotdogs, hamburgers,  fries and no complaints from them on the taste of the food.   only complaint is ive been thru the drive thru 3 times now and twice they have forgotten something in my order.  seems they are trying to rush the order out the window.  so the only thing i would suggest is someone to double check the contents of the bags before passing them out the window.  i try to remember to check mine but with big orders its easy to overlook a missing item.
late on this review but hey better late than never, right? i have frequented portillos on several occassions. they do not disappoint. the italian beef is awesome. i have had this sandwhich original,no dip, dipped, sweet, hot and on occassion all of the above. i have never had a bad experience here. sure, the lines get long and sometimes there is a little confusion in the drive thru but the deliciousness of the big beef is so worth the short lived chaos.
midwest inspired, enjoy hot dogs on a poppyseed bun, burgers, sausages, and other sandwiches. portillos offers a drivethru service as well as a very large indooroutdoor seating area to enjoy the food. the crinkle cut fries are a must, and expect your hot dog to be served chicago style sport peppers, onions, celery salt, etc. but they can make it the way you like. we visited portillos on a saturday around 1:30p and the place was packed. its extremely noisy so the ordering process was a little annoying. be prepared to shout what you want during busy hours. its also hard to hear your order number called out. its all counter service, but the folks behind the counters seemed friendly enough. there are stewards near the ordering line to help first timers figure out the menu. i saw a pretty decent salad station that seemed to make some pretty nice looking salads if you want to watch the calories. wed come back the price was right... 21 for a family of 3. they also serve malts and shakes, those looked to be a popular item. the patio is decent sized and had space heaters for the cooler weather. id bet this place is really popular during mlb spring training season with all the snowbirds. have fun!
went to portillos today for lunch in tempe az.  it was busy.  the food was good.  typical chicago.  it reminded me of the portillos in elk grove village, not far from where i used to work.  i ate a beef and cheese croissant.  my wife had the roasted vegetable foccacia.
so i was a little bored one evening and decided to finally try this place months after the hype of grand opening. i figured by now the hour long lines will be long gone and everybody in maricopa county had tried it at least once by now. so i get to the northeast corner of mcclintock and e rio salado parkway and enter a real clusterfork of a parking lot. since the drive through lane is pretty big and surrounds portillos you have to park off to the east where there are signs telling you that you can only go in one direction. there is more parking beyond what you initially see when you first enter the area though. pretty much all the parking right in front near the entrance are handicapped parking stalls. fortunately, portillos was a late afterthoughtaddition to this mall so it has its own corner and is pretty much completely separate from the rest of the mall. an island of chicago in a tempe mall. if i remember correctly its more or less the same corner that nitas hideaway used to be on many eons ago. so you come in and see multiple areas  one for phone order pickup, and all the way in back a place that you place your order. you then walk halfway across the restaurant after ordering and listen for your number. everything comes in a thick brown plastic tray with four drink holders. so i ordered a standard fountain drink as well as a maxwell street polish dog, a bowl of chili, and a tamale. hadnt eaten all day more or less so i was hungry. luckily it was not very crowded and i found some seating right away. i would hate to have to eat a hotdog in a hallway. so anyway, the hot dog was delicious  especially with the grilled onions sprinkled on top and with a bit of mustard as well. but no ketchup. which is good because as dirty harry once said nobody, i mean nobody puts ketchup on a hot dog! so that was the best part of the meal. then i had the chili. came with cheese and onions. it was alright. i like the chili at lobbys better though. truth. finally  the tamale. it was wrapped in foil and then again in several layers of the kind of paper you wrap food to go in. it was one long greasy gut bomb. pretty much plain masa and what tasted like the sauce in the chili inside it. perhaps its that toddling towns version of a tamale and if i was an expat homesick for the windy city i might have enjoyed it much more as the nostalgia kicked in. but since im not from chitown and have only been once in my life for a couple of days when i was grade school age i was just curious as to what their tamales tasted like. fortunately curiosity didnt kill the cat but instead gave him about 3 or 4 swift kicks to the stomach and a stern warning. never eat those again. all night i felt my stomach churn and im sure the tamale was the the cause of it. if you ate 5 or 6 of those youd be a walking tear gaspepper spray cannister. so after i was more or less satisfied i walked back out into the night and noticed that the closest store in the rest of the mall to portillos just happens to be lane bryant. i guess if you become a really big fan of portillos that is rather conveniently located. im sure ill be back again one day.
not like i remember it to be in chicago, but the char broiled chicken sandwich was still excellent.  i still havent tried their hotdogs, but their chicken is phenom.
if you are a chicagostyle hot dog fan . . .  or just about any kind of hot dog, portillos probably has it.  sandwiches of all kinds  the italian beef was super good with a little gravy, a lot of gravy or literally dipped in gravy and oozing from every pore of the wonderful italian bread.  its just a diner, like many weve all been to for years, but portillos has that little extra oomph . . . not sure what makes it different, or even better, but it is. maybe it is because its here and its new and i dont have to visit chicago to get a really good diner lunch. whatever . . . if diners are your personal choice of eateries . . . portillos is the place to be!
it was so busy when i went, but i was impressed with how quickly our food came out. i got the chili cheese dog and my boyfriend is a fan of the italian beef sandwich. i like the food, but for the price point i dont think we will be going too frequently. it was almost 20 for a sandwich, hot dog, small fry, small onion ring and two small drinks.
great atmosphere! came here with a true chicagoan which made the experience even better. i now want to go to chicago for st. pattys day next year!italian beef, sweet peppers and extra gravy is all i have to say. fries were okay. beef is shredded so thinly with the perfect amount of seasoning results in a delicious sandwich.  would highly recommend or the italian beef and sausage sandwich. i think i will be craving this from this point on......was a little disappointed with the vanilla milkshake we ordered. not the best.
fast and filling and tasty. i wish the cheese fries had cheese on them and not served on side. chili is awesome, love the chili dog.
omg!!! the italian beef w spicy peppers really hit the spot! a must try! we also tried the cheeseburger. hubby got the big beef so good! parking is kinds tight but the fast service makes up for it.
had the italian beef and cheese fries and was excellent. actually didnt see anyone eating a hot dog. will definitely be back.
love, love, love this place!!! i always get a beef and cheddar croissant with extra sweet peppers and i highly recommend it. the ordering process is a little overdone and confusing at times. the place always seems overstaffed yet it takes longer than expected to receive your food. still the food is good so i keep going back.
portillos is a great experience for the whole family. we went a few days ago and loved the food. the italian beef on top of a hot dog really takes hot dogs to the next level. the chocolate cake shake is to die for! its fairly priced but the menu is hard to read. when you walk in the door its a bit overwhelming with where you order and the line system is a bit unorganized.  overall the place is awesome and has a great patio too.
who cares if you overhear conversations from visiting chicagoans or transplants?  portillos has a good concept and great bread to serve their beef on.  thats the focus, not the people you happen to meet eating in the business.its never a disappointment to order the original beef with hot giardiniera and a side of gravy.  this to be said about the tempe location:  delicious.  the beef, tasted like beef.  the bread chewed like good italian bread.  the gravy was a great foil to cut the hot giardiniera.  spent 3 days in the phoenix area and had lots of choices to eat a quick meal.  glad i ate here than some pretentious dining establishment on this day.
im from chicago and while in chicago i actually prefer a less expensive a simpler dog  fries from gene and judes.  however, portillos has always had great hot dogs, beef sandwiches and chocolate cake.  needless to say, in phoenix, when i need a hot dog fix, the next best thing to making my own is to head over to portillos. todays visit didnt disappoint with hot dog, fries and chocolate cake shake.  this was my first chocolate cake shake and while im not a chocolate ice cream fan, ive read great reviews about this shake so i decided to give it a try.  its delicious!  i just needed a vanilla shake afterward to wash down all that chocolate!  just kidding, i drank a ton of water afterward though.
italian beef sandwich, chili cheese fries and a cake shake!best lunch ever when im feeling naughty and ive gone a week eating rabbit food!
its por till ohs. like pillows.food good. made fresh to order...not fast food out of the freezer.  it takes a while. its worth the wait. dont eat too much..you need dessert. i mean it. ..you need a dessert.  dont leave without one. you wont regret it. thanks for reading. go eat...why are you just sitting there.
the italian beef is great, the italian sausage is amazing! great place to eat and a fun chicago atmosphere.
i went with my husband today  my second time, his first.   i ordered the chili cheese dog and it was amazing!  i really like that it was less than 4 and if i was any more hungrier i couldnt gotten two for a pretty good price.  my husband ordered a steak and cheese on croissant roll which looked pretty good.  he did say he wished they had chopped up the peppers, but im sure theyd gladly cut them if he asked.  well definitely be back soon!
i live in chicago, so im used to eating chicago portillos on a weekly basis.  the portillos in tempe, az does not taste the same as the portillos in chicago.i got a hot dog and cheese fries and they tasted really good, but not as flavorful as chicago portillos. the staff was very friendly and my food was made in a timely fashion.overall it was a really great effort to bring chicagostyle food to az!
the only place to go for a chicago hot dog and beef sandwich. there are a ton of place who claim to be chicago food, but this is the real deal. although the az staff doesnt quite stand up to the real portillos back home, they do pretty well. they did screw up the maxwell polish, suppose to be sauteed onion  mustard on a hard roll, but they use a hotdog bun and burned both the onion and polish. theyve screwed up a couple of orders when it wasnt busy and also have people in the drive through when it was dead. back home they only do that when its busy, which works great. when im the only one in the drive through, just let me order at the menu, i dont need 3 different people serving me. inside, the area where you collect your food is too small, they need to clear out a couple of tables, people are standing on top of each other when its busy. oh and when youre in the drive through they wont let you have two separate orders when you have someone with you paying for themselves. never heard of that in my life.
i have to laugh out loud that the first 3 bad reviews i read were all in regard to a salad. a salad. who goes to portillos hotdogs for a stinkin salad? i dont know about their rabbit food, but if youre craving a greasy tasty burger, awesome chili dogs, perfectly cooked cheesy fries or loaded up big beef sandwiches, this is your place.super busy, loud, ample seating and a pretty efficient ordering system are all expected on each visit. the one time i had my order screwed up multiple times, they apologized profusely and gave me cake.  chocolate cake. on the house. really? how can you beat that. i cant judge their salads, then again, im not heading to pita jungle to try out their burgers, either.
this was our first time here and i must say that i am a fan! fast, friendly service and great food make this place a great spot to eat a wiener or a fantastic italian beef sandwich.
very good food and pretty darn fast for it being lunch rush. i hope they open more in az its not very close so not a place we will travel to often to try new things.
chicago born and raised, and even begin to say how much i love this place!! it even smells like home : im not a fan of chocolate, but every time i go, i have to order the chocolatecakeshake!!
i was very happy when the first two portilos store locations opened up in phoenix. i am a chicagoland native who loves to share a great causal meal with friends at these restaurants.the following will be borrowed from a previous location that i have reviewed. it will be several of my favorite foods from the menu. enjoy! roast beef sandwich. one of the best roast beefs in town. i would recommend getting it with mozzarella cheese, hot peppers, double dipped in gravy. its a fantastic meal! for those with a serious appetite, try ordering the big beef. its twice the sandwich for only a little more. jumbo hotdog with everything on it. a jumbo all beef hotdog with onion, relish, tomato, hot peppers, mustard, and a speared pickle. this is the epitome of the chicago hotdog! a must try! i recommend ordering two.fresh chopped salad. ditalini pasta, crumbled bacon, romaine and iceberg lettuce, red cabbage, tomatoes, onion, gorgonzola cheese, chopped chicken, with a great blend of spices.now a few things that i would stay clear of... the cake shake and the malts. the cake shake take a piece of their famous chocolate cake and blends it with a chocolate shake. it is way too much chocolate for a desert. i would only order this if you have a serious sweet tooth. as for the malts, they are seriously lacking with the malt power and you can get a better malt elsewhere in town.
great food but a little pricey for basically fast food. everything is a la cart and food can add up when your eyes are bigger than your stomach.
we went to portillos for the first time this weekend  it was a long time coming, as we had both driven by and heard so much about this place for awhile. walking in, we were overwhelmed with the large size of the restaurant, and the amazing amount of decor and memorabilia items covering the walls and ceiling. you order at the registers and wow  their menu is way more than dogs and fries. pasta, salads, burgers....but really, who orders anything but a hot dog at this place? we both got regular sized dogs and i got a side of onion rings with mine. the dogs were good! nothing out of this world, but definitely fresh tasting and yummy for sure. pretty sure i will order the jumbo size next time, though.i wasnt overly thrilled with the onion rings...they didnt seem super fresh to me  i like my onion rings golden brown and piping hot.i will definitely be back  great bang for your buck! we left with full tummies, but didnt feel overly stuffed, which is always a plus :
having been to a portillos in chicago a decade ago, i was looking forward to trying them out. the decor inside instantly makes you feel like youre back in insert worn out chicago nickname here.  we got some classic chicago dogs, an italian beef with hot peppers  cheese dipped, some fries, some rings and a piece of cake. the dogs were exactly like i remember and i want more right now just writing about them. i dont know, something about the soft poppy seed bun, beefy dog and that neon green relish along with the crunchy sport peppers just makes me instantly crave them. in hindsight, i should have skipped everything else and left more room for dogs. maybe the italian beef was awesome for people who have all the memoriesnostalgia that goes with a dish like that, but as ive never had the real thing, it was wasted on me; it was just some soggy bread and bland beef. again, i feel as though i may be dissing someones religion here, so forgive my blasphemy  i know not what i ate.
went to lunch here for the first time. this place is super cute. loads of character!  i had the everything hot dog with fries and a coke for about 7 bucks. the food came out quickly and tasted great. im not a big hot dog fan generally ..but i really liked it!
surprisingly my favorite thing on the menu is the poppy seed fruit chicken salad! delicious
good chopped salad and the italian beef is always tasty. the service could not be friendlier and this is similar to the original chicago restaurants.
atmosphere  5 stars. the decorations and employees are dressed like chicago and makes it a cool place to hangout and enjoy a meal.i went here a few times, first time i had the beef with sweet peppers and thought this was okay no big deal.... i was taught the missing ingredient that makes all the difference in the world, it is unhealthy but if your going to do it, do it right.when ordering the big beef ask them to make it dipped. yep, it is a soggy mess and requires 5 napkins but makes all the difference in the world.
i was surprised at how much i enjoyed the italian beef. i didnt get to try a hotdog, but next time i definitely will. my only complaint: no hot sauce or tabasco! i love to put tabasco on my cheesesteaks, and i actually happened to have a packet in my purse, and it added the perfect kick to the already delicious sandwich. very inexpensive, too!
i love classic chicago food at portillos! i went to the one in tempe for the first time. i was very happy that it was such a great place to take kids, as there were three under that were 8 and under in our party. its casual and it is very comfortable to take a large group we had a large group, too. it is a little overwhelming and busy going in there  just so much stuff and seeming chaos going on when its so busy. but, the menu is simple and it was great eats. i love the hotdog with poppy seed bun with everything on it. nothing like it! the onion rings were crisp and delicious, too.everyone in my dining party was very, very happy. even the kids were happy with their food. i highly recommend portillos. just remember that it is classic food from chicago and not necessarily what youd expect at a hotdog stand in the phoenix area.
supposedly its national cheeseburger day! not sure how true that is but its a good enough reason to partake in a cheat meal. i decided to try portillos for the first time and good lord that burger was the effin bomb!! best burger ive had at a restaurant! now the onion rings that i got were a no, but back to the burger. a hey boo and seductive wave to the person who was responsible for that burger. i, as well as my stomach thank the hell out of you. i even ate the pickle and i never eat the pickles on a burger. i usually ask restaurants to take the pickles off but i forgot. there were about 5 cars ahead of me but the line still moved rather quickly considering there was a guy outside taking orders. my food was nice and hot. i like the fact that the burger is in a container instead of plain ole paper bc it kept my burger warm as i drove back to work. all in all, i give portillos a 45 instead of a 55 because those onion rings get a naw bruh from me lol.my top 3 burger places would now have to be:1. portillos2. the habit3. in n out
ive eaten at the scottsdale portillos, but since ive been away, they opened this second location in the tempe area in the mall area.  since im a fan of a good hot dog, i came here to eat with a friend for lunch and to hang out. im glad i did!the menu has a bunch of stuff to choose from, but i went with my usual, of two vienna beef hot dogs with mustard and onions with a drink. my friend went with the same order as well.  fortunately, there wasnt to much of a line, but as we sat and chatted for a while, we noticed that crowds came and went in spurts.i love how the place is decorated. lots to look at with cool lights and the such.  our food only took about 10 minutes or so to come out and it was delicious.  it was hard to hear the girl call our order but we got it the second time she called our order number out.  staff here is pretty friendly and cool and things seem to move along quickly. plenty of places to sit with all the fixings at the condiment counter you can think of.  the only downside is that the fountain drinks are located behind the order pick up counter. i dont know why they do this.  it would be nice to have one located for self service, since refills are free anyways.  i had to get more sprite and i felt like i was bothering the girl since the counter was slamming busy when i went back up to get more pop.  it would make it easier on the staff if patrons could refill their own drinks.overall the food was good here, and i do like eating here when im in town. the buns are tasty and make the dogs good.  if was i was still in town i would probably try more menu items, but i wanted to keep it simple since i was starving and was craving their beef dogs.overall not half bad.  cool place and i love eating here.  they also have a huge patio to eat outside at with shade overhead so you dont get hit by the sun.
lets start off with the cons of this placecons: no combo mealsno kid mealsits literally right up the street from me this is bad , very bad lol if you can get over that, then i guess you will be oki have been a few times now and i have to say they are slowing winning me over. the 1st time i went i swore i would never go back the 2nd time i went i thought damn this is a good hot dog the 3rd time i went i had to admit i am a fan.i love the chicago style dog, i always order the portillos all beef dog, it comes with mustard big win for me since im not a fan of catsup relish, freshly chopped onions, nice slices of tomato, a quartered dilled pickle and hot peppers all saflely bounded together by a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun and all this for just 2.65!! love it! when you check out there menu you will see they have a lot going on, from hot dogs, to sandwiches to burgers, to salads even soup  deserts and for you veggin love fools they even have a meatless menu too, so im sure there is something for every picky eater out there.if you havent given portillos a try, i think you should, if they didnt win you over the 1st, like me, go back and try it again, believe me it wasnt love at 1st bite for me either but now im a fan!
what a cute place with great sandwiches. i can see why this place is popular for a fast food type experience without the typical fast food. i had the italian beef sandwich which is a specialty of theirs and really delicious.hubby went with the same only his was a combo with sausage added. fries were great and its a cool place to take the family, out of towners or drive thru they take your order in advance of getting to the windowindoor and outdoor seating with checkerboard pattern. we will be going back again soon.
i mean what can i really say about portillos that hasnt already been said a million times over?!?! if you are looking for greasy, cheesy, grilled, salty goodness...then portillos is the place for you! this is my ultimate cheat meal destination!!! i always get the bacon burger, chili cheese fries, and the chocolate cake shake...i can never finish it all...but i am never disappointed!
its portillos! what can i say? super reliable, very good food! always been a fan of their burgers and fries. for the locals here, give it a try. this is probably as close to chicago food as you can find here.
we ate here no 110614 around 1:00 pm.  the line to order moved very fast.  the menu has a lot of items to select from.  no combo meals.  the cashier people were friendly and helpful.  we had no trouble finding a table to sit.we ordered a big beef, onion rings, hot dog, jumbo hot dog, and fries.  the food was great.  i dont think i ever had a hot dog that knocked me off my feet.  but the food was very enjoyable.our bill before tip was 26.  we plan on going back again in the future.
food was good.  im not normally a big hotdog fan, but i cant passup a polish sausage! with onion rings.  everything tasted great.  the instore soda was pretty weird to refill.  i had to go to ask where to refill it  the alreadybusy staff had to take their time to refill my soda behind the counter.
great food.  good service.  fun atmosphere to eat in.  with all the other good reviews on this place not much more to say.  give it a try if you are in the area.  if you are a fan of italian beef dipped sandwiches you will not be disappointed.
810 years ago i was working in chicago quite a bit, driving up from st. louis for a week at a time and thats when i discovered portillos and that beef and cheddar croissant.  that thing is magical.  totally unhealthy and i love it.  i think back then i tried a couple of other things on the menu, but when i think of portillos i think of that sandwich.now that portillos is in az we thought wed give them a try and see if its still how i remember.  and get this.....mr. m lived in chicago for a few years and had never been to a portillos.  can you believe that?  so we had to go.he ordered the italian sausage with bacon and i ordered the polish sausage.  we also ordered the chicken pecan salad thinking sharing a salad would soothe our guilty consciences for eating those tasty sausages.  my polish was about a 35.  the sausage itself was great, 55, but the bun was soggy and fell apart after one bite and had way too many thick onions on top.  i love onions, but this was overkill.  i had to pick half of them off and it was still smothered with onions.  mr. ms italian sausage with bacon was probably our favorite thing that we tried.  45.  the sausage had a very nice flavor and came on a more sturdy, italian bread type bun.  next time ill have to get the polish on that bun.  it held up very well.  as you can see in the pic, the bacon isnt high quality bacon, kinda tasted like the precooked stuff, but it worked.  the salad was kind of a letdown.  2.5 or 35.  i thought it was kind of funny how 6 pieces of spinach ringed the bowl, but then 98 of the salad was just bland iceberg lettuce.  the description on the menu says a blend of lettuces.  it was mainly iceberg.  the chicken was ok, but tasted a little like the precooked stuff too.  it also had a gazillion diced, tasteless tomatoes in it.  with tax those salads are close to 8 bucks apiece and im not sure they are worth it.  didnt hate it, but probably wouldnt get it again.  i like that their bottles of water are only 99 cents.  a lot of places try to bend you over there and charge 2 bucks or more for a cheap bottle of water.  overall an okay meal with the sausages being the star of the show.i cant believe i didnt get the beef and cheddar croissant, but thats just a reason to go back.  they have enough good stuff on the menu to justify the 4 stars for me, and generally the staff are very friendly and helpful.  they are used to being busy and have a good system down.  the only complaint i had was there was an employee cleaning tables who had a spray bottle of chemical that he spritzed a little too close to our food.  be aware dude.  i dont want my food glazed with windex or whatever the heck.
my favorite hotdog in arizona . i love the sweet peppers on the portillo chicago dogs
the service here has improved tremendously and i feel comfortable recommending this location to everyone.
being a chicago native i am familiar with the portillos name and the quality food and customer service they provide. i have since moved to phoenix, arizona and while im thrilled they opened the chicago staple out west, i have some concerns. the employees seemed indifferent. no one seemed enthusiastic about their jobs or provided exceptional customer service. because im watching my waist line i asked for nutritional information, but none could be produced or provided. although the service is subpar the food is excellent. they have a wide variety of fresh salads my personal favorite is the chopped salad. however, if youre willing to splurge you cant go wrong with an italian beef and piece of chocolate cake!
our finicky kids love the hotdogs, fries and onion rings.   outdoor patio is busy but nice and clean.   salads mediterranean and applewalnut were a good size and we all left with full bellies. maybe it was the chocolate and strawberry milkshakes that put us over the top.   thick and creamy!  salads are prepared and served at a different area of the restaurant so it can be hard to grab everything when its crowded and you have little kids in tow.    will visit again!
i recommend catering your next party with portillos.  we usually get  a few pounds of italian beef, chop salad, and tamales.  their chocolate cake is excellent too.
i went to portillos on a quick stop to tempe. the ambiance and interior design of the restaurant was very unique and enjoyable. they have a massive kitchen with tons of employees working and you can watch them cook. it was pretty fascinating. i had the beef and cheddar crouisant. it was pretty good. portions are a bit small, but at least the prices arent too high. it seems like a fun family restaurant. overall, good food.
loved portillos since the first time ive had one of their beef sandwiches in chicago over 20 years ago. i was really happy to see they had opened a couple in the valley of the sun.  my old standbys are the italian beef sandwich with green peppers, the hamburger, and their hotdogs.  the beef sandwiches can be hit or miss depending on when you go in.  when theyre good, they cant be beat, when theyre not so good theyre still better than most any place in phoenix.warning about the chocolate cake shake!  i love the chocolate cake and i like the shakes.  but putting them together.... well, imagine portillos chocolate cake in a cup with a little milkshake mixed in.  saying its rich doesnt even come close to describing it.  if youre into a super sweet super rich milkshake, go for it.... but be warned, its really sweet... i could only drink a third of it.
love this place! have never had the same thing twice. would suggest the chicago dog of course! but the poppyseed children salad is delicious! had the breaded chicken sandwich today.!
i hated traveling to phoenix.  i have to for business but i hated traveling to a town like the one i live in, where they have no food identity.  that has changed since portillos came to town, i loved going to them in chicago, excellent italian beef and great dogs., and now i can get it in in tempescottsdale, makes traveling here a little more bearble.
great hot dogs, the beef sandwiches are amazing. those are the only two things i have had here. will try a burger next time. they look good. the crinkle cut fries are fantastic as well. big eating area and very family friendly casual. parking can be tough. dont like asking for refills.
order the italian beef sandwich with sweet and hot peppers and extra gravy. if you are still hungry go get a chicago dog and a shake. this isnt fine dining.
such a good place with good atmosphere! i wish the hot dogs had more flavor to them but i love their cheese fries! :
i final made it to this place. i had the italian sandwich, double dipped. yummy!  it was busy, but the service was fast. you just walk up and order.
consumer reports rated portillos as having the best sub sandwich nationally so i had to try it.  they are a chicago eatery serving hot dogs and italian beef sandwiches.  i have tried both the hot dogs and italian beef and both were excellent.  i added a slice of mozzarella cheese and asked for my sub to be dunked so it would be extra juicy.  took my grandson on my second visit and he loved the atmosphere and the tasty italian beef sandwich.  i will be back many times.
portillos is a chicago staple and being new to the area, i was happy to see some of chicago in phoenix.  good food and i love the shakes.
so good.  we just moved here from iowa and have eaten at portillos in naperville.  this was just as good if not better.  i am usually not a hot dog person, but this place will make you one.  husband had the italian beef.  loved it.  the even better part was our family of four was able to eat for 31! its about a half hour drive for us but well worth it!  we will be back soon!
tried this place one time a few weeks ago for dinner around 8pm and it was good.  its nothing super special but its good.  ordered the cheese fries, strawberry malt shake, chili cheese dog and the italian beef and sausage sandwich extra wet.  the fries were good with the cheese dip, it was kind of like nacho cheese.  the sandwich had sweet peppers and onions and she added cheese for us,  mozzarella i believe and that was hearty but the flavor was very mild, really thought it would have a heavy flavor impact.  the chili dog according to the bf was good since he ate it all. that hotdog we ordered with grilled onions. now the malt shake... that was really good.  could really taste the malt in it!! didnt have room to try the desserts but looked really good!cute atmosphere and love the decor.  the staff was very friendly and really enjoyed dinning in!
portillos was close to the level of hype my chicago friends rave about. we entered it on the way to the airport. upon entry we were nervous it would take too long because there was a very big line. however they were very quick with filing people through and getting their orders fulfilled. the chicago dogs were the the best ive had to date. my only complaint is the italian beef sandwich was really soggy when we opened it out of the wrapper.i look forward to next time, as i will try either the chocolate shake or cake. i hear these are excellent choices.
4.5 starsi have passed this portillos many times.  if i am headed down this way, it is usually down the street a few more miles to go to teds.  my intent was to get some dogs at teds again today but when i pulled off the 202 and mcclintock, i had a strong craving for portillos cheese fries.  something about that magical cup of hot, melted cheese sauce reeled me in.i finally figured out the perfect order at portillos.  2 jumbo dogs and a large cheese fries.  this comes in at just under 10.00 and it is well worth it.  i have had other things at portillos sausages, italian beef, salads, etc but nothing is as good as their jumbo hot dogs.  i get mine topped with mustard, onion and that neon green relish.  they are a hefty sized dog with a little bit of a snap to them.  these dogs are laid in a nicely steamed poppy seed bun. they are flat out delicious and filling!  for their fries, they use a crinkle cut fry.  they arent the best fries in the world but because of the crinkle cut design, they are the perfect fry to dip in that molten lava cheese sauce.  it coats all the nooks and crannies of the fry and makes it one hell of a dip!im sure i will be back soon enough!  service was very attentive and friendly and this place is pretty easy to get to.  the parking lot is a little confusing if you arent paying attention, but if you can navigate that and get inside the door, great hot dogs and cheese fries are waiting for you!
ive been hooked on this place since i lived in california, when i heard phx was getting one i said about time.everyone i take to portillos loves it.the decor is awesome.lines move fast.you can see your food being made.chilli cheese fries are a bit small in portion but scrumptious.sweet and spicy peppers along with the combo sausage and beef is delicious . huge milk shakes.
this place is good for those who like this kind of thing.  well, duh, you say!  ive been here several times with my family. they typically get chilicheese dogs, italian sausages, fries, and sodas. so far, no complaints from any of them, and the kids want to go back any time were in the area. ive had everything from salads to burgers, hotdogs chicagostyle and chilicheese, tamales, even the italian beef regular and large... and dry, wet, dipped, etc. and whatever they call the combination italian sausage  italian beef thing. everything i have had has been fine. i think the chili is good, and the italian beef with cheese and spicy peppers is probably my favorite. get the gravy on the side so you can control how much goes on there. without the gravy, the sandwich can be a little dry, and when they dip it, the bread tends to fall apart before im finished with the sandwich  and i eat pretty fast.my only complaints are that the poppyseed muffins they serve with the salads tend to be dry and very bland, and the famous chocolate cake is not anything i find terribly special. for that matter, the salads have a nice variety, but i think they might be a little bland overall, too. but, i tend to like things with a little spice or vinegar tang to them, so take that critique for what it is worth. keep in mind that you need to pick up your salads near the ordering line, not at the place where you pickup all of your other food and drinks.the lines move fast and the people taking the orders are friendly and efficient. the team that makes the food and calls out the numbers are likewise nice, and usually seem happy to grab a drink refill if you hang out by the order pickup area with your cup.
heard tons about this place. went for lunch today, food was good, service was good, the atmosphere was god awful. so it was lunchtime,  ill take that into consideration,  but theres a whole lot goin on in there. microphones calling out numbers, 5 maybe 7 different lines, signs, people everywhere, cleaning, taking trays etc... drive through had their own traffic director..i felt so rushed to eat because of the overall noise volume in there..sounds weird, im sure. but i was shoveling my salad down all stressed out..haha. . i recommend some noise cancelling panels or something. im sure chicagoians  could take a nap and feel right at peace, but i left with a headache and a tummy ache.. my salad was amazing..and the hotdog is legendary, so we will be back, ill pack my ear plugs on the next visit!
maybe it was all of the build up that i had heard prior to going that makes this review 4 stars instead of 5, but all in all it was pretty good... but just that, pretty good.i had heard so many amazing things about portillos from all of my chicago friends that i just expected this place to wow me. like i said before, it was good... but i was expecting great.with all the hype on the italian beefs, which are very tasty, the hidden gem for me was their burgers. very flavorful, well cooked and taste like theyre cooked over an open flame. i dont know for sure whether they are or not but either way theyre a solid order.its great when teds hotdogs is closed and i feel like a link and fries...
one of those places that just hits the spot. i would give it 5 stars, but sometimes the portions and quality are not consistent.
you come here for the beef and that is all.  have it dipped and served with peppers.do not consider anything else on the menu.  i reluctantly tried a hot dog today, full well knowing i would regret the decision later, but just had to try something else out of curiosity.  the hot dog was good.  my friend said his tamale was good.we both lost to our other friend who had the dipped beef with peppers.its a damn good sandwich, and youll be happy you got it.
good hot dogs. nice staff , we heard some shrieks from kitchen....no big deal....anyway they were handicapped friendly for my friend, so thats a plus i guess. seemed pretty huge and empty to me..maybe it was because we went on a tuesday night?
ive been here several times and its always so good! i got a coupon for buy one get one free on the italian beef sandwiches. my friend had never been here so i told her to meet there. i usually have the burger but opted for the beef since i had the coupon. it was delicious! get it with hot and sweet peppers and if you get fries, get the cheese sauce. youre welcome. the service is always friendly and consistent as well. top it off with a chocolate cake shake and then hit the gym twice the next day!
the noblest of all dogs is the hotdog; it feeds the hand that bites it.  ― lawrence j. petealways a great place to grab a quick bite.  located on the outer region of tempe marketplace, this place is great.  lots of parking, ample seating, and fast!  pay attention for your order number if you decide to grab a seat instead of waiting at the counter.i like grabbing a portillos allbeef hot dog.  whats not to love about a chicagostyle dog?  its no superdawg but its a super dog!  mustard, playdoh green sweet relish, freshlychopped onions, two slices of tomatoes, a kosher pickle, and sport peppers nestle up against a hot dog in a steamed poppy seed bun.  mmm!  dont even touch this beast with ketchup or ill throw my shoe at you.  for 2.85, i usually have to refrain myself from getting two.  its cheap but i like to get other items besides hot dogs.  the beefncheddar croissant with both hot and sweet peppers... oh man.  need i say more?  the chargrilled maxwell street style polish is pretty darn great as well.  its an explosion of grilled onions, mustard, and a meaty sausage thats what she said.  all in all, its a great place to grab a bite without breaking the wallet.  all that grease for such a low price.  ;
hot dog. good. cheese fries. could be better. was given regular fries with a small cup of cheese which tasted of nothing. literally was just, i cant even describe it. it was not cheese... i would come back for the hotdog though. very soft buns.
was too lazy to make my salad this evening so decided to come here for a chop salad not bad it was tasty
it gets very busy at lunch, but they have lots of tables inside and out. lines move quickly and the wait for your food is typically short.  highly recommend to try.
chopped salad is on point. and that strawberry shortcake! bonus points for the lemon poppy seed muffins.
i love this place! they have the best italian beefs in the valley. the only con is how long the wait can get in drive thru. also do not order the chicken sandwiches. they take forever and dont taste good.
very good food and authentic chicago style. i are the chicago style dog and the hot italian beef sandwich and both hit the spot. line gets a little long at lunch time and its a little pricey but good food and a stylistic diner environment
takes longer than most drivethrus but i think it is worth it, great burgers  onion rings! love that they are open later also  that they will do a well done burger for my picky self.
i enjoyed the food, a tad pricey but its good wholesome food and nowadays you pay for what you get.
we got the italian meats, hot dog with everything on it, and burger. my husband loves the italian meats sandwich and gets this every time with no disappointments. my 2 toddlers shared the burger and it had a really good taste and was a good size. i had the hot dog with everything and it was good but the bun was a little soggy. the bathrooms were clean and the staff was really friendly!
excellent service, clean building, and great food. this location can get a bit congested at times, their prices are a tad  high and the arizona locations do not serve beer like the illinois locations, this makes me pass when i feel like a beer with my meal.four stars.
this was great.  if you want healthy this is not the place although they do have salads.  i ordered the double combo which has the italian beef and sausage along with sweet and hot peppers and got the dipped version.  probably would only do gravy next time.  dipped is messy and you will need a fork to eat it.  also got the cheese fries.  great meal before heading to the airport.
thought i had updated this review, but the salads here our getting better. the greek med version has a good bunch of roasted chicken chunks, kalamata olives, chickpeas and a bunch of other tasty produce. whatever dressing comes with the salad is a good choice as well. drive through not crowded at 2pm and that lemon poppy seed muffin they include with your meal complements the salad quite well. well worth the 8 bucks and filling too.
so grateful that theres a local portillos now! ive been with people who arent from chicago and they thought the ordering process was weird, but to me it was normal since i grew up with it. portillos has it down to a science on how to get orders out as efficiently as possible regardless of how many customers are there. the only thing i order is the italian beef with hot peppers on the side and it is exactly like the sandwich you would get at a portillos around chicago. the only con to my review has to do with the physical location of the restaurant itself. its in a really weird corner of tempe marketplace which is hard or maybe not possible to get to from the main parts of tempe marketplace without going on mcclintock or rio salado.
a sneaky speakeasy cocktail bar tucked behind a door with a sign for a detective agency and an obviously false brick wall. look at the wall on your left for the brick that sticks out to push and enter.  excellent date place, not just because its fun and sexy to surprise someone with a sneaky space, but also because its quite classic and beautiful and relaxing inside, sunken below the messy young hubbub of lower st denis you feel a bit like you are outside time and space. the waiters and bartender were kind and attentive and professional, and the list of specialty cocktails was tempting. the 3 we tried were a little sweet for my taste, but definitely interesting and subtle. id like to go back and just try some classic drinks and see, old fashioned, sazerac, i look forward to visiting these old friends to see how they do in this lovely, small, tasteful environment. i look forward to coming back and hanging out here in the dark leather booths and enjoying the quiet feeling of being out of time.
this spot was a blast. i cant stop talking about the secret entrance way, the fake detective ad on the door and the hollywoodquality creation of a prohibitionera bar. the only thing the space was missing was a cloud of smoke above everyones head.i wanna take all the dates here.i agree with risa in that the drinks were a bit sweet i had some teawhitegrapetequila concoction that was nice, but i definitely couldnt pick out all the fantastic quality ingredients that were going on in there over the sweetness.
i was pretty hyped up for this place at first. the yelp reviews were looking good, and the menu sounded yummy... plus, pans got that whole shiny new restaurant feel to it. the two of us ate here for dinner, with somewhat mixed results.atmosphere: i like that you can choose from outdoor and indoor seating! we ended up eating inside, where the lighting was a bit dim and moody. i think next time id definitely try the patio. food: pans restaurant week deal is pretty sweet compared to what most restaurants offer. we each got the 1 roll  1 bowl special for 20.15.keylime scallop roll: i think the sweetness of the sauce was a nice touch! very interesting combination. lobster monkey roll: this one was kind of a miss for me. the flavors felt confusing, and while i can appreciate what they were trying to go for, banana in almost anything is a very overpowering flavor. when you pair it with mango, which is also pretty strong, its hard to appreciate the actual fish in the roll.drunken noodle: i liked this dish! the scallops and the noodles were cooked really well, and the flavors were good.hanger stirfry: my 1 requested it as spicy as they could make it, but somehow that got translated into an slightly salty dish. : it wasnt terrible, but it wasnt great either. many glasses of water were downed in the eating of this meal. service: all of the staff we encountered were wonderful. everyone seemed friendly and open, and i think we got just the right amount of attention. when dave came by and asked us about our meal, we mentioned the salty stirfry. he ended up taking it off the check, which was a nice gesture. in the end, it saved us 4 since the lobster roll alone got charged as full price, but it was still appreciated. :id like to give this place another shot, maybe during one of their happy hours. so far, pan seems promising, but i cant say i was blown away.
we got the restaurant week deal, which was a sushi platter and a bowl for just 20. im not typically a huge fan of sushi but both sushi platters we got tasted great and might convert me to become a regular sushi eater. the drunken noodles had that wonderful wok stirfry taste to it, and the noodles were extremely soft  a rarity when i eat these noodles. the hangar stirfry, however, came off as quite salty. i think its because i asked for a super spicy dish, and their spice may or may not have had a significant salt component. i ended up drinking 3 glasses of water, but the waiter was super nice about my feedback and even asked me if i wanted a new dish. i kindly declined the offer, and then when i got the bill, they didnt charge me for the stirfry at all! the people here seem to be really receptive to feedback, so im willing to give them a second chance.
i went here for restaurant week and thought the place was charming. the service was on point friendly, knowledgeable and timely. i had the sake cocktail which was excellent the cranberry was perfectly mellow, not overly sweet at all. for the rolls, we had the lobster monkey and the scallop roll. both were delicious. the tempura banana and mango habanero sauce with the monkey roll were so fun and unique. for the bowls, we had the drunken noodle and the duck special. here is where the 5th star is knocked. the drunken noodle comprised of one large scallop sliced into three thin slices. the duck was a small portion and was pretty dry. i wont say id order the bowls again, but i will absolutely be back for the cocktail and sushi happy hour, along with the excellent service which would absolutely be 5 star quality!
we ate a delicious meal at pan tonight for our anniversary. we shared the tempura shrimp, a watercress salad with mango, cucumber and avocado, sablefish with pickled mustard greens and shaved pork cheeks with bok choy  more. would like to return and try more of the selections. our server jordan was very attentive and helpful. enjoyed eating outside and hearing the two fountains. bravo!
very nice.  good service.   cute waiter.   very nice food.  generous tapas.   fresh ingredients.   nice drink selection.   fair prices.  need better music.   too much coldplay and red hot chili peppers.   i will return.
pan really lives up to the asian fusion by having creative and unique dishes, as opposed to other places that are just a hodgepodge of generic dishes. i tried the chiang mai cauliflower. expected it to be a little more saucy, but still had excellent flavor. my date and i also split a sushi roll.very attentive service, almost too attentive, but it was a wednesday so the place wasnt crowded.the excellent ambiance, both indoors and on the patio, and decent pricing makes this a great date spot!
i just stopped by this pan while riding my bike and had sushi and sake. the service was great and the fresh salmon roll was delicious!!  i will be back to try other food items on the menu.   they do need to expand their sake offering and add sapporo light or kirin light to the beer offering.
we went the week it opened. the steak was done perfectly! unfortunately they have no way of heating the sake which really docked my interest. i wont be returning until i hear better things about the drink menu, bartending skills, and warm saki.
being a fan of musical theatre and seeing the trend of these prenightclub shows, i was very curious to see how this show would work in its setting. ive seen all three of the movies featured in the show, and moulin rouge is one of my favorite movies ever. i dont think you have to be familiar with the story lines to enjoy the show, but it definitely helped. i thought the moulin rouge portion worked best because it is the only one of the three that is a musical, and they could have done the whole show with just that and i would have been happy. the cast was relatively small and characters had to overlap between storylines but i thought overall it worked very well and the singing was incredible. my only real complaint is that this nightclub was not built with a stage production in mind. when i sat down in my seat which is really just a booth, i almost walked out because a giant speaker was obstructing my view. i looked around for other potential spots and noticed the only other option was to sit behind a giant column. you know its bad when the introduction to the show recommends that if you cant see, stand or sit on the backs of the seats. they do try to move throughout the room during the show to give different angles and but most of the action happens on stage so i really wouldnt go see this show again unless i was sitting center or on the floor.however, this show was really awesome i enjoyed everything else about it and even though the seats werent great, you get sucked in immediately with the music and emotion. i think its a great idea and everyone seemed to be having a great time. one last thing: its freezing in there. i get that its a nightclub about to pack in sweaty dancing bodies but until then the ac doesnt need to be blasting.
definitely something worth seeing. only downside is drinks at the bar are pricey.
i needed a handyman to finish up a bath remodel i did. simple things like painting, install new baseboard, install mirror, towel bars, fixed drywall around light fixture and removed medicine cabinet. he did a great job considering it was humid that day and drying time for drywall and paint took longer than anticipated. he stayed below estimate even though it took him longer which i appreciated. he also was very honest when i asked about other projects....basically telling me i can get certain projects done cheaper elsewhere than if he does it. i felt comfortable with him in my house which is a nice feeling i even took a nap while he was working!. i do believe i could have gotten the job done a little cheaper than what he charged but its all about the quality of work, honesty, being comfortable, and as his name states....integrity.
im so pleased this little market is now a part of the bloomfield scene! my boyfriend and i popped in on a whim a few weeks ago to check it out, and weve now been back multiple times. its the perfect place to grab produce for a lastminute cooking project, and in the cooler towards the back there is a nice selection of bottled beverages. they even carry frizz coffee, an addicting blend of espresso and soda imported from italy that tastes divine either spiked or on its own! i think its safe to say ill be a regular here...
ive been to lash vegas twice on a groupon i bought ... both times were very easy to book, they were also very understanding when i was running about 15 minutes late for my first visit. both times my techs were super friendly, sweet ladies. the first full set i had was just okay came back for a fill earlier than expected even with proper care. just finished my first fill and amelia made me feel super comfortable and told me if i had any issues with major fallout to come back and speak with the owner. i definetly would recommend booking with amelia!! would give 5 stars if it werent for the first set issues but i know its not always the techs fault!
i had great service and its a very clean salon.  the only negative part was trying to make an appointment.   i called several times.  on my last attempt i left a message and was called back.  i had a groupon and it was totally worth it.
i absolutely loved this place! it was my first time going, my sister treated me to getting my eyelashes done  im super satisfied with the way they look : i went to kiran  she was so sweet, helpful, very fun to talk too  very nice! she keeps in contacts with her clients  i loved it! she is definitely a professional she did them absolutely gorgeous i cant wait to come back for a fill!! i loved it here very clean,  beautiful i definitely recommend coming here because they make them look super natural. they only thing that sucks is the prices but its worth it!! thank you kiran
for a bachelor party event, 7 of us signed up for this for an early sunday morning session. we drove to some desolate corporate warehouse area and walked inside. we were greeted by a dude wearing some bdus and holding some type of airsoft assault rifle. he introduced himself and he gave us a quick low down on the rules and what to expect. this is where it started getting crazy and interactive! some soldier dude runs out from the back, screams and yells something, runs outside, and we hear some gunshots go offfiring blanks. theres a tv screen showing the parking lot of the building, and you see an explosion of some vehicle. then 2 special forces dudes come out to the lobby where youre standing and start screaming at you to get to the back to get your equipment. chaos ensues!  i dont want to spoil anything else because its definitely something you need to experience for yourself, but get ready to sweat, run, and shoot some zombies. our 2 former special forces guys wombat and gator definitely made the experience so much more realistic. they went over basic maneuvers, how to enter and clear rooms, and a crash course in combat tactics. the only thing that kept me from giving this business a 5 star rating was the limited number of rounds and magazines provided. they said that there were about 100 rounds in each magazine2 provided, but i know a few of the guys in our group got gypped with a lot less rounds than that. one of our guys even had a broken magazine which didnt even feed the bbs into his gun. i know for sure that my second magazine did not have 100 rounds. and if you run out of rounds, you can purchase another full magazine for 10. yes, you read that right... 10!!! i used to airsoft and i know that a huge bag of bbs dont even cost that much. lower the price guys, bbs dont cost that much!  i think starting players off with at least 4 mags would be ideal, and then charge maybe 1 for another mag. 2 mags was just not enough. also, the goggles provided would fog up so much, that half of the time, you were blowing air up towards your eyes to defog them, or take them off for a few seconds, while trying to shoot at zombies, it took away from the experience. i think that maybe providing the player with a choice of either using the goggles or some shooting glasses would be a good idea. other than that, this adventure was kick ass. we all had a blast. the sets inside, the sound effects, lights, and actors playing the zombies, were second to none.
the experience itself was 5 stars  gator and wombat were both awesome! i was on gators team and had a blast. i dont want to spoil things for you but just wear sneakers and dress comfortably as you would to the gym...you will be moving around and it will get quite warm!i will definitely be coming backprobably more than onceand bringing anyall friends from out of town who are interested in checking this place out. forget those boring, cliche cirque shows, this is where the fun and onceinalifetime experience is if youre a tourist. lots of deals to be found right now groupon, yelp, etc. since they are still relatively new so it comes out to about the same price you would pay to watch the o show which is totally overrated and not worth the money imho.i found this place on groupon and got a deal for the husband and i to celebrate our anniversary. 7 years is a long time to be with someone and this is a great way to relieve some stress and take out that aggression on some zombies! haha jk ; most women get spa packages to celebrate with their significant others...i got this adventure combat ops experience  krav maga classes! lolso why 4 star overall rating if the experience was so awesome? a few things that have already been mentioned for the most part and could easily be addressed:the limited rounds in each mag and limited number of mags  would be nice if we were provided an extra mag andor they offered an extra one at 5 or something more reasonable especially if you go in a group ex: 3 for 15goggles  kept fogging up andor slipping out of place as the band was stretched out. if they could provide normal shooting glasses andor allow and suggest individuals bring their own if they have them that would be great. if youve shot before, you know how the regular classes style goggles are much more practical and less likely to fog upgroup size  this really depends on the time slot you book and your luck though...ours was packed so despite being split in 2 groups each group was still 9 people which felt a bit cramped in the rooms  structures we went through. i think 6 would have been an ok group size but 9 made it less challenging and a bit less exciting than it could have been with smaller groupslack of etiquette and skill of other participants that may be in your group  this is out of their control and really luck of the draw who you get grouped with but it is worth noting. if you have shot guns in real life, been around real guns, and understand the etiquette and rules, you will be very frustrated cause it is alarming when people dont understand basic gun safety. this is how firearm accidents happen in real life and what gives gun control nuts fuelguns dont actually kill people, crazy andor stupid people kill people. but i digress and that is a whole other topic i could go on for hours about. gator did a great job explaining the rules in the beginning such as always treat a gun as though it is loaded, never point a gun towards anything you do not intend to shoot one of the most important rules that kept getting broken, and understand what is both behind and in front of your intended target yet people kept breaking these rules. there was this one guy in our group who kept pointing his gun and he had the kind with a laser and flashlight towards people so it was blinding everyone. gator did do a good job calling him out on it once or twice but there were still a number of times he did it for awhile without being called out. again, not gator or the adventure combat ops teams fault but just something to be aware of and prepared for.
i went here at 11am place was empty and just opened up. ordered the burrito of the week which was beef. 5 with purchase of a drink also a fry supreme. all in all the food was really good although the beans are a little watery that was the only complaint. i will return. prices are also pretty decent and the guy working there was pretty friendly
a great place to enjoy a freshly made burrito. the prices are good, and the ingredients are fresh.
clean. simple. good taste. mostly pizza and panini sandwiches. they have other selections however you should come for the pizza. pretty good. thin crust. the crust is fairly tasty. the sauce is wonderful and the topping choices are very good. price?  wish it was a few dollars less. but i will return.
we were there the 2nd night they were open. lots of staff, all very courteous and knowledgeable! food was good. had the don alfonso pizza. really good flavors, but would have liked a tad more meat. meatballs came out a little cold, so they rushed them right back and got us new ones. had to wait a couple awhile as they were quality checking, but we didnt mind as i thought that was a good sign they werent nuking them! not only were they delicious, but they compd them since we had to send them back. sculpin on tap, which the hubby is a fan of and really good, authentic drinks. its a little crowded inside for my liking, but there was a ton of staff on hand and our table was right by the bar, so i imagine itll feel less cramped when they dont have all hands on deck. all in all, fantastic pizza, good drinks and another gem in downtown gilbert.
super cute ambiance. outside seating is cool, even in 100 degree heat. tentative but not overly bearing staff. our server didnt really know the difference between vegan and vegetarian, so she recommended several options that werent really options. she got it right by dessert, though. it was nice to have a vegan pizza option with daiya cheese. that being said, it was just ok. it lacked flavor. edit: it was much more flavorful the next day after it had cooled! the crust was nice, thin, and soft. i did like being able to dine out with friends and not have to order a salad. overall cute place but nothing i was super excited about. four stars because its not a vegan restaurant  but it has a decent vegan option.
pizza and ambiance were great.  they have a very cool outdoor area with a powerful misting system that keeps it at a comfortable temperature.  the inside seemed a bit noisy.  the service was okay an the reason why i am giving 4 stars.  the waiter seemed somewhat snobby, repeating the names of the items we were ordering in the correct italian pronunciation.  he only checked on us from far away and didnt even ask if the food was to our liking although the pizza was flavorful.  i wanted dessert, but the pizza filled us up.  although i would be happy to go back just to try their dessert tiramisu, torta napolitana, torta nutella, creme brule, etc. all and all, a good experience.  a must try pizza, for sure!
tried this place out for a friends birthday party. tried two different kinds with my wife. a few pieces were more done then i would like, but pretty good still. my wife doesnt really care for pizza and loved it. she was willing to come back and that is a huge thing. it is a little pricey, but very good.
the food was worth the wait! this is a small joint and they struggled with seating a party of 5.  we arrived before 5 pm on a saturday night in order to avoid the wait but still waited over 45 minutes.  however, we had great service and a delicious meal once we were seated.  the bruschetta trio was amazing and we loved the 2 pizza choices that were recommend by our server jessica.  dont miss the cannoli.  great addition to downtown gilbert!
my boyfriend and i recently discovered the downtown gilbert area and wanted to try something new for dinner. i had a craving for pizza so i thought we could give pomo a try. we loved the atmosphere and the service was great! the best part was the food. we had the bruschetta to start which was delicious and then chose the pomo pizza which was delicious also. everything tastes authentic. we will be back again!
had a part of two on a friday night. we expected a wait but were seated immediately! i had a tasty cocktail made of tomatoes and watermelon sounds weird tastes delicious. server was friendly and knowledgeable. delicious vegan pizza.
just finished up our first experience at pomo in gilbert. our server  jimmy was great! we ordered 3 different pizzas and they were all very good. dessert  canolis and tiramisu were also delicious. we will definitely be back!
ive visited pomo in downtown phoenix, but this is the first time to pomo in gilbert.  overall was a great experience. food was good with solid service.  restaurant atmosphere has less personality than the downtown location, but its likely because its so new.  i look forward to watching pomo grow with popularity.
is it the best pizza ive ever had? no. but its definitely a welcomed addition to the east valley. i love that the kitchen is an open concept which allows you to see them make your pizzas. the service was super friendly, and even though its a fairly new restaurant, i feel like they have their stuff together. ill definitely be back.
we read lots of reviews on pomo pizzeria and finally decided to go to this one instead of in phoenix and we loved it! we order the don alfonso pizza and it was great, and the olive oil added a nice touch! i wouldve given it a five, but unfortunately we had a very odd waiter. he was older with brown hair and wasnt helping us with picking a pizza, he would only drop one thing off and race away to do nothing but stand, and wasnt very polite. we will go back again but probably to the downtown phoenix site.
recently ate here with a friend for her birthday and got to sit at the bar. if you get the chance, try to sit at the bar so you can see the pizza being made! we had the pepino and calzone. the pepino is a must try, full of flavor and very crispy. also, if you are looking for something different to try, their calzone was delicious as well! very cheesy and the salame piccante inside is quite tasty. overall a good experience here!
i looked down at my pizza and the heat fogged up my glasses like some sort of nerd who saw something sexy.just kidding. i had my contacts in but i did see a sexy pizza in front of me!i love pomos and with one being so close to home in downtown gilbert, nestled nicely in the heritage marketplace, im over the moon! great ambiance; beautifully golden tiled, woodfire, pizza oven where delicious pies are cooked; and a friendly staff! ej was our waiter this afternoon and he was super friendly, charismatic, and those dimples! phew!  since we strolled in shortly after 1:30pm, and after the lunch rush, there was absolutely no wait time.  it was nice and clean, the ac kept us chilled, and ej kept the waters full and the food coming!  heres what we had:bruschetta classica:  homemade pugliese bread, roma tomatoes, garlic, fresh basil, and evoo.  i love me some bruschetta mainly because im a carbwhore and love bread!  the bread was toasted to perfect crunchyontheoutsideandchewyinthemiddle median and the fresh tomatoes were delicious.  splash on some of their house evoo infused with crushed chili flakes and im in heaven.  it was the perfect antipasti!the napoli:  described as,  imported fillets of anchovies, basil, sicilian oregano, i was immensely pleased with how delicious this came out.  the thin crust was on the chewier side which i wasnt anticipating since it was baked in a 900°f woodfire oven and was pretty flimsy.  there was a good amount of cheesedrag whenever i bit into the mozzarella and the smoky salty anchovy was delicious.  it was a delicious combination that made my skirt flip.the pomo:  italian sausage, roasted red bell pepper, sauteed onions, sauteed mushrooms.  while i only had a single slice of this bad boy, i gotta admit, i wasnt too impressed.  the crust held up better with the pomo than the napoli but it was kind of vanilla.  eating this pizza, the one thats suppose to be the house and special, was kind of bland.  it needed a kick from some crushed peppers.  good sauce ratio on this thin crust pizza.creme brulee:  we wrapped up the meal with a classic creme brulee.  we were actually torn between the brulee and tiramisu but i was offered the dessert i wanted.  how could i say no?  perfect caramel crust and a smooth creamy custard.  it was a bit strong on the vanilla but i loved it!  the strawberry shaped as a rose looked pretty but i wish they cut it into slices so i could eat it with my brulee.  also, im never one to turn down a little whipped cream with my berries.  just saying.all in all, pomo is a great place for a pie.  theyre actually ranked in the top 10 pizza places in town!  so give it a try!
fast service and great food. came in tonight and brett was super friendly and attentive. would definitely come back.
great food and great service. the inside is a bit loud so we sat out on the patio where it is quite pleasant. despite it being hot outside the misters kept it cool and we had an enjoyable time. the pizza is the closest thing to pizza in italy that we have found. we had the bruschetta trio and the flavors were great. we also had the margherita pizza and quattro stagioni. the crust was thin, flavorful and soft. i preferred the margherita but my mom and sister preferred the quattro. the waiter brought my mom a panna cotta for her birthday. he was very attentive but not overbearing. a great place to eat!
this place is great, at a great price. the atmosphere is very modern yet accommodating. its located in the nice, chic historic district of downtown gilbert, and serves pizza. the wait staff was impeccable. we were very well attended to, and katie, our server, was very efficient and pleasant rare to see in any profession! our food was also very good; the meatballs were very well put together and seasoned i noticed a few other patrons using them as additional toppings on the pizzas they ordered. the pizza is made naplesstyle, and is firekilnes in a certain manner leaving the crust on the outside crispy and soft in the middle. this was great, but my only note is that the pizza i ordered the pomo... seemed like its toppings were pretty lopsided. however, the ingredients used on it were top notch and tasted great. we left filled and happy.
great atmosphere and service. our only issue is with the limited menu options. if you dont get pizza, there really isnt much. my wife ended up getting a bowl of pasta fagioli and i got a really good pasta. we probably wont be back only because we really arent pizza for dinner people.
so i gave pomo pizzeria gilbert only four stars because i like the atmosphere of the downtown phoenix location better  and they didnt have stella so i settled for a coors light.with that said, i ordered the toto sapore pizza and it was absolutely fantastic!  i did sit out on the patio which was quite relaxing and nice.i absolutely recommend pomo pizzeria and will be back  often!
it was good! reminded me of pizzeria bianco. it was a little pricey but good pizza. love the chill infused oil they have a the tables.
pomo is great! love the atmosphere, bar area, patio  wait staff. we ordered the toto sapore it was good, a little too meaty for me, but my husband liked it. we also ordered the donna rosa which was the shrimp pizza. we ordered it because it sounded interesting and it was really good! i have been back a couple other times and always enjoy myself.
we really enjoyed this restaurant.  the don alfonso pizza was great and we had 2 of their desserts which were quite good.  we sat out on the patio and the atmosphere was quite nice.  great addition to downtown gilbert.
absolutely amazing pizza!   they have achieved the perfect crust with great flavor and perfect texture.   i had the diavola and my wife,  the quatro stagione.  but were amazing.   she said it was the best pizza she ever had.   i say it is certainly better than pizzeria bianco.  the romano kale salad however was uninspired  pieces of kale, romaine and romano cheese with almost no dressing.   therfore, only 4 stars.  but,  hey, we didnt come for the salad. best pizza in town! !
i keep hearing people rave about their nights at the bongo club, and i can see why. i didnt know it existed until a few months ago, i think it may be a well kept secret between trendy music lovers in edinburgh.we went here after i refused to go to cab vol one night due to my hatred so a friend suggested here. im glad she knew where we were going because there is no way i could ever find it again, i know it is towards parliament though so that is a start. the club nights on offer here include jungle, dub step, drum and base, reggae and dance music. it is a real alternative to the indie and mainstream clubs that edinburgh has so many of. i never thought that i would enjoy a night of reggae music, but it was really quite fun. we pretty much danced and bounced around having a great time, enjoying cheapish drinks and a good atmosphere. this club has a real sort of cool, scenester vibe to it while still being quite relaxed and laid back. this club is a bit different to everywhere else and offers something a bit more exciting. it is pretty popular and i can only see its popularity growing. it isnt too expensive and probably a great option for those random nights out where you dont make too much effort but it ends up being beyond awesome.
taking a look at bongos headspin residence i was eager to see if the four deck mix of hiphop, funk, house et al was just another slight deviation from the mainstream or indeed something interesting and unique.  hearing some samples from the beastie boys, george benson and even a bit of james brown i was glad of an edinburgh club night with a difference. occasionally the guys behind the headspin residence are accompanied by some music percussion or even live sax , which is welcome change from the regurgitated samples you hear in most clubs.the venue itself if ok.  nothing more, nothing less.  reminiscent of an old school hall and with a dismally small bar the bongo club needs good music to stay afloat. thankfully it has this in abundance.
firstly, the actual venue is nothing out of the ordinary. its just a series of rooms, some large and some small with a few bars and other features. its a bit of a mess if im honest, if you look beyond the flashy lights etc, but that is pretty much my only down point to this club.mostly, this place is different  its a massive departure from the other clubs and venues around the city, and generally has a much more chilled and relaxed atmosphere. i always seem to feel that people come here to have a laugh and a dance, rather than certain places which feel like their soul purpose is for posing in and getting hammered. oh well.its pretty cool to have somehwere with such an ecllectic mix of must too  i was nicely suprised the first time i came here to realsie it wasnt all the drum n bass stuff i had imagined.it also seens this place does a few random gigs and is even a cafe during the day, so its trying hard to be a good all round place.
bongo is a cool wee club, residing slightly further away from the frenetic hubbub going down in the grassmarket and cowgate areas. ive seen quite a few gigs in here, and been to a few very random nights, one of which involved me randomly deciding to party it up on a monday night, kind of an unusual choice for me, and brandishing a glow stick while careering round the dance floor to different ravedance tunes. theres quite an eclectic, randomness about bongo, which im keen for.the dance floor and gig space isnt huge, but it gives the place a really friendly feel and bongo is one of these places where you just seem to chill out a bit as soon as you arrive, and i quite often find myself bantering with a load of random people before not very long, something that i think is more difficult in other, frostier clubs and bars. i saw a brilliant gig here and squeezed my wee self to the front for a good view, but if youre of normal height and not a munchkin like me, youd get a good view wherever, and thats whats good about seeing gigs here. the club hosts a range of alternative nights too, and is also used as a venue for performance art including theatre and dance classes.
the bongo club is certainly the alternative venue for a night out in edinburgh! located just down in the holyrood area, the bongo club is quite small and also has a cafe which is open during the day. however, this place really gets going during the evening. the bongo club hosts alternative nights including reggae, world and rap music. it also offers a range of gigs by local, well known and tribute bands. the best night i had in the bongo club, was when i went to see the smiths indeed. the place was very busy but still everyone was dancing and having a great time at the front of the gig! the audience was full of die hard fans, arty people and students, all creating a great atmosphere! if you dont like mainstream, you will love the bongo club!
a club in a similar vein to cab vol, bongo is awesome, but has a tendency to attract a load of arseholes. the music is a bit of drum n bass, dubstep, electro and other similar genres. this is really good fun to have a bit of a shimmy to, but also is the type of music that attracts pretentious twats. you know the kind, with the nike high tops, some form of coloured skinny jeans and a slogan tshirt, probably with a retro 80s ironically disgusting sports jacket. yeh those idiots. if you can look past these though, youll have an awesome time. the atmosphere is generally really good fun and the music is pretty sweet. especially 4 corners, on once a month, which is a bit more chilled out and some of the best jazz, funk, soul and ethnic music around. the drinks arent too cheap, but most people are normally too monged on drugs to notice. one of edinburghs best alternate clubs and is awesome either for one of their normal nights, or for the gigs that come round now and then.
well, i cant say ive been to a lot of hte club nights at the bongo club, but ive been to a fair few gigs, and i like it in there. the bar is pretty reasonable for a club, the accoustics arent too bad, and something about the place just makes me like it, i always seem to have a good time there with my friends. even that one time at headsphin when i was drunk and thought i could fake spinning on my head and just made myself feel sick and dizzy. top night.
this place just opened up in the old qdoba on central ave. looks like the menu is still a little limited since they just opened less than a week ago, but what they have so far is great. they have some good variety in flavors with their tacos ranging from the more standard adobo chicken and steak, to teriyaki chicken, and spicy korean bbq steak, they even have some vegetarian options. they also have salads and quesadillas, i didnt try either so i cant vouch for them. talking with the staff, who are super friendly by the way, it sounds like they are working on expanding their options as they go. i hope so, itll keep me coming back to see what is new.
had to stop by this place and get some food.  it was delicious and super fresh!  got a 12 piece meal as well as a 3 piece tender meal for the kids.  they normally charge for extra sauces but they gave me an extra bbq for my son with no cost.  i went through the drivethru and was super indecisive as its been a long while since ive eaten there.  definitely will be back!
my family loves popeyes chicken family meals. we have tried the fried catfish a few times and it is not that great. love, love, love the mashed potatoes and gravy, dirty rice, fries and even the mac n cheese. so happy there is now a closer location!
so far im pretty  impressed! i thought popeyes was just another crappy chicken place but honestly everything ive had here is delicious. chicken is crunchy moist and tender without being too greasy. sides have tons of flavor and do no taste overly processed like kfc does. since discovering this place  i ll never go to a kfc again!
i pretty much order the same thing all the time...family meal with chicken tenders, two red beans and rice and biscuits.chicken was good.  red beans and rice were more rice than red beans...i like it the other way around.  biscuits were ok.  they forgot to ask me if i wanted honey and i forgot to ask, fortunately i had honey at home.ill be back.
i decided to try out sushi 168 on the day of their soft opening july 2nd, 2015. on walking in i was pleasantly surprised seeing modern decor and plenty of open air. its often that in these type of establishments to see the business try and cram as many people in as possible but this obviously wasnt within their business plan. i came just in time for the lunch buffet which is more of an ayce because its offered for 15 until 3:30 monthurs. they informed me of using ipads to order any items that i wanted from their menu and was even instructed how to do so once i sat down. i found the app very easy to use although it is very mildly pedantic since the plus sign to add an item is very small resulting in many misclicks. all the food that i had ordered primarily maki rolls was very good and i believe the ingredients were of good quality.i found the wait staff to be very attentive and concerned with anything i could need, frequently asking if my food was good and if there was anything else they could get for me. in addition to the wait staff, most if not all other staff was finding ways to keep themselves busy on what considered their soft opening. be warned that this restaurant probably wont have their llbo license for at least another monthoverall: good atmosphere, good serving staff, and good weekday lunch ayce pricing. only caveat to this would be that they didnt accept debit cards at the time of this review.
i visited this restaurant on saturday which was their third day . i have eaten at 168s other restaurants in southern ontario and was aware that this restaurant was going to open from their website. the interior was modern as i expected; however it is quite different from their other restaurants. the soup,salad and desert bar was a pleasant surprise. the menu was quite familiar to me and quite tasty. a couple of the dishes i tried were not quite as good as their other restaurants and a couple of the sushi items were better here. the lobster soup was a pleasant surprise.overall, i was impressed. i cant rate it compared to other sushi joints in the kw area; however it rates quite highly when compared to the approximately 25 ayce restaurants that i have dined in. of the 4 sushi joints that i ate at from friday to monday, this was 2.
this place has amazing service and the sushi is on point something im always looking forward to is the bbq eel rolls and 168 sushi had possibly one of the best bbq eel rolls ive ever eaten, and for the buffet its was small but had a decent amount of variety of food you can choose from, also if you go to most all you can eat sushi restaurants if you order any meat related food the meat is usually a bit chewy but the at 168 sushi buffet the meat is perfectly cooked and taste amazing, i would also like to point out that the washroom was pretty amazing because of the supplies they provide for you in the washrooms axe, gel, calone, perfume, etc. this place over all has amazing service, good food so i would highly recommend this restaurant if you are trying to find a sushi buffet to go to.
i think this is one of the better ayce places in kw. they have a huge selection of food to choose from. you can get sushi, dim sum, korean, thai and a bunch of grilled appetizers and fried or soup noodles. their dessert selection is much smaller but they have a shaved ice machine to make your own shaved ice dessert! thats basically ice with a bunch of syrup and toppings of your choosing. they also use an ipad system to order your items which i thought was a great idea. its environmental friendly, you can see whats been done and if you really want to keep track, how much youve eaten! their washrooms were also pretty cool. they have a mini station set up by the sinks with supplies you might need like floss, hand cream, hairspray and etc. the food was pretty decent and overall i enjoyed my experience there. will definitely make another trip back!
they have a diy shaved ice machine here!! im a fan. really really nice looking restaurant. they nailed the decor and it looks amazing. all of the sushi and rolls were great. however, some of their other dishes werent so good like their beef kalbi, which was very salty and shrimp tempura. their service was top notch. the food came out really fast and they were super friendly. they even gave us a handful of jelly beans on the way out! i hope the place continues to be this good in the long run.
first trip to this sushi bar. we like the salad bar idea, all the seaweed you could eat!!! and the shaved ice is pretty cool. my 16 m old is a fan : my husband was a bit disappointed with the spicy salmon roll. said it would be perfect without the added onion? and i wasnt sure about the mango sauce ontop of the green dragon. but the fish was fresh, bbq eel was perfect. would definitely come back and recommend!! thanks for having us!
the interior design of sushi 168 is really nice! they have a central table area where you can get saladsoupice cream and to my delight, bingsu! i definitely went overboard with my first attempt at making bingsu haha. my inner bubble tea passion exploded at the sight of unlimited pandan jelly and popping bob and i put way too much syrup and jelly.the remainder of the food you can order on an ipad similar to itames. sushi 168 has a huge variety of foods  korean, thai, japanese and chinese. we ended up trying a bit of everything except for the dim sum no one was really in the mood for that. the thai curry was okay, you could tell that they cooked it with the thai curry sauce you can buy off the shelf. we got ddeokbokki from the korean menu which was really good and authentic, and i have literally no complaints about any of the chinesejapanese things we ordered. i particularly enjoyed the seafood udon, katsu chicken, beef on a stick and the cheese wontons. they didnt really have a lot of interesting sushi rolls that also tasted good. we tried a bunch of them, including the las vegas roll, the gym roll, and the fruit roll made entirely of, you got it, fruit but nothing really stood out. i feel like this is where sushi 168 lacks in comparison to places like kinkaku. however, all the traditional rolls and single sushi were made and tasted well. presentation was good and service was quick! there is a variety of sashimi available, i only ate the salmon, white tuna and surf clam so i can only comment on the quality of those which is that it was good nothing too special but also not untasty. overall this place deserves good rating! its super close to campus and if you pay with cash, you get a 5 discount.
the buffet has a similar menu to the one in mississauga. nice decorations and atmosphere.
this place is fancy aflike shieeeet they got free cologne, lotion, and mouthwash in their bathrooms. total score. now i dont have to go to shoppers drugmart anymore lmao
good place to go!! though not too many types of food but what they serve will not disappoint u!! especially eels! and mocha ice cream w red beans makes me cry! so delicious!
went here today with the family we had the following ribs: we a little over smoked you need to eat them with bbq sauce as the rib alone did not have much seasoning. they also left the membrane on the back of the rib which is different. half rack 12brisket sandwich was good the thing i liked the most was the pulled pork. it was the cheapest item too. i would recommend a better bun than just a regular hamburger bun. even if they upcharged for a nicer bun i would pay more. or talk with one of the local bakery to get a better bun or rolls to add to the meal. they need  to fill up the cups of bbq sauce to the top ours were all half full.  the cheesy casserole was good and very different. most bbq places make a good tea they need to offer that as good tea pairs well with bbq. glad we have a bbq place in surprise i think they will continue to get better.
great new place. the owner is so friendly. food was fantastic. simple menu but everything was perfected. loved how they had lean brisket. my only issue would be to add smoked turkey to the menu!!!! the bbq sauce had a great flavor. we will be back.
my wife heard about this place through friends, some of whom are fans of smoke.stopped in to pick up the family pack enough pulled pork for 46 2 sides coleslaw, cheesy potatoes and buns 25.obviously we put some of the slaw on the sandwiches, and added a little extra sauce that was generously supplied. very enjoyable, more of a vinegar based sauce but good flavor, pork was perfect flavor and texture, and the slaw was the kind i could just grab a fork and go to town on.it seemed like they had a busy lunch rush since when i arrived there was a sign that they were out of brisket and ribs until dinner. may be advisable to call ahead about availability if you have a particular meat on the brain.well be eager to go back and try the brisket and ribs.
very good bbq. few things could be better like toasted buns and bigger portions. also a little more variety would be nice. however im super excited about how nice and clean the place is and good the food was. no good bbq in the west valley till now.
got the pulled pork with coleslaw. pulled pork was really good but the slaw not so much. i tried the cheesy potatoes, they were good. kind of a simple place but its clean and the staff was very nice. i would go back.
finally made here and it was worth it!  we dont have a lot to eat out west and to get a really good restaurant is a win win!!!   i really like this place. meat was really yummy! .   cant wait to go back soon!!!
my son and i had a couple of brisket sandwiches that were great. not many places like this in surprise. nice to see them here.
checked this place out for the first time yesterday. i ordered the pulled pork with cheesy potatoes and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich lean with cheesy potatoes. you can have onions and pickles put on your sandwich. since i had never tried either on a bbq sandwich, i tried both. the gentleman who was cutting the meat was very friendly. im guessing maybe he was the owner? he even brought us out a sample of the ribs, which were delicious. we ended up ordering a half rack to take home. we will definitely be back again. i enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich, but my husband said the brisket was a little dry. i also liked the cheesy potatoes, but they were just ok to him. next time he said that he will order the ribs. i just wish there were a few more options on the menu, like maybe hot dogs and fries for the kiddos.
good service.  small place and i always like to go to small independently owned places to eat.  had the pulled pork sandwich and it was tasty.  i agree the buns need to be changed.  give it more time and a bigger menu choice and it could do well in surprise.
husband and i ate here today for the first time. it was really delicious! staff was very friendly and informative. explained their smoking technique, no par boiling or baking of meat, all smoked. even gave my husband a rib sample after we had already ordered and were eating our selection. we both agreed we would definitely go back!
the food was great. you could tell that the put a lot of time into their food. great bbq souse and favors. love the mom and pop attitude of the restaurant. could use more decor it seamed a little light on that. some fun pictures or signs something. otherwise it was great.
this establishment was good, the meats were all very tasty. the reason i am giving it a four star rating is because they didnt sell any chicken. over all, its a good place to eat if you love red meats.
everything was good. portions were excellent. customer service was fast and friendly. i think the brisket was exceptionally good. we will be back for sure. the price was great. they have a family meal i am looking forward to trying. my kids can eat a lot of food. it was also very clean. picnic bench seating.
this place used to be the cavalier and it was empty for a while. happy to see it open again. stopped in on 7515 the staff was pleasant and the drink prices were good. 2 for a cold pint of old vegas tavern lager  might have been pabst or high life  video poker machines are good didnt win but didnt lose my money instantly. the decor is really nice with pictures of classic las vegas entertainers and places. i will definitely be back to try the restaurant. the old cavalier had great food until the smoking ban made them shut the restaurant. i hope the old vegas tavern can come close to it.
i am going to say this straight out, with one small change this place would be a 5 star, no doubt in my mind.okay, so this used to be the cavalier, it closed a while back, sat empty for a while, then was bought and remodeled. i used to like the cavalier, it was old vegas, the food was good, the prices not bad, but it was badly in need of an update and i guess the previous owners didnt have or want to put the money into it.anyways, thats the history lesson, as we live close by i figured it was time to give this place a visit, as there were only 2 previous reviews i went in with a pretty open mind.i like the remodel, nice and clean, im not sure the name matches the look of the place, but hey its a name, who cares.the foodthe wife ordered a caesars salad and meatball sub, i went with the short rib, heck if a place is going to be brave enough to put it on a new menu, lets see if they can fall flat on their faces.....they didnt, oh boy they didnt, seriously, its good, no thats an understatement, i would put the short rib up against any in town, the chef who was the chef at portofino inside the desert inn can cook, oh boy he can cook.the meatballs were excellent, the salad was great, but those short ribs, dear lord, if you like short ribs, get in your car and get over here.the one negative, if youve read my reviews, you know by now i hate us foodssysco products, well i ordered french fries with the short ribs just to see, and yeah, they are us foods frozen crap, a chef with this obvious talent should be able to put out home made french fries, if not for that this place would get a 5 star review from me, the service was excellent, the food great, this is another place that deserves the support of the yelp community.
its great to have another nice restaurant on the east side....we have so few good ones and a lot of bar and fast food.  the bartenders were very friendly, and the machines were nice to me that day.  i like the card of the day where everyone playing gets paid!  the only food i tried the first visit was the fried zucchini and it was not my favorite because it was too heavily battered.  will certainly be back to try out the dinner menu soon!  its a very fresh and relaxing atmosphere with no loud juke box.  great job on the wall decor and the train carrying the old vegas signs is neat.
good to see a decent restaurant in this location where the old cavalier was. friendly service and adequate menu. we each had a meatball sub which was excellent. strong recommendation if youre looking for threestar food at twostar prices.
totally cool little bar.   10 min from downtown....tons of parking and caitlyn pours a cold yummy drink and is s totally funny chick...check it out for keno and drinks !!!
i called ahead to request a pedicure appointment on a friday and was told to just come on by. i hoped i wouldnt come by just to wait and when i walked in nearly every pedicure chair was full and they have a lot. to my delight a technician was available to assist me immediately. i chose the standard pedicure for 26. she did an excellent job and did not rush. the massage was great and my color done neatly. 26 is a little much, but it is scottsdale. my only complaint would be the massage chairs because you can barely feel them. overall, id recommend it!
first, go here with the intention of eating a lot! portions are large! service: excellent, the young servers were very attentive and hard workingfood: cheesy!! the 13 little bit of everything was amazing specifically the tamale...mm! the chicken enchilada and taco were loaded with chicken if you like meat! personally, i liked the shredded beef more.ambiance: this is where this rating isnt a 5 star. the layout is exactly the same as compound grill and doesnt have that homey feel. i would recommend adding some color and more culture! prices: entrees are reasonable, however appetizers are a little pricey guac 7. the skinny margarita is excellent if you dont like sweet drinks. my husband ordered cadillac and he rated it 810. definitely a must try!
dj our server was 5 star! the food was good too, but the five stars are more for this service. we ordered mexican pizza, fajitas, gauc, and spinach dip.food was ok service made up for some of it
attentive server.  we ordered fajitas chicken and steak and had plenty of food. the chips and salsa were excellent.  clean restaurant, visually appealing, tastefully decorated. ... the tvs should be upgraded to something bigger so you can see the score ; highly recommend
we used to go to the scottsdale and bell location frequently.  the new location has a great new bar area, and the food is still great of course.  just longer waits now to get seated, and they have removed some of the really good items on the happy hour menu.
i think the owners must take the yelp reviews seriously, because i visited this new carlos obriens location for dinner recently and had an excellent experience.we were greeted right away in a friendly manner by the hostess at the front desk. she seated us and within 10  15 seconds, a friendly wait staff member brought chips and salsa to the table. the waitress greeted us about 20 seconds later and took our drink orders. staff members worked together to keep our beverages filled. several staff members offered more chips and salsa to us, but we declined, knowing that the entree portions are huge.the combination plates were large and satisfying especially the tacos. the shrimp fajita platter was huge and delicious. the menu is large enough to satisfy most everyone. they even have nonmexican food items if you are in the mood for pub food.the only complaints i would have was my rice was clumpy in spots. also, while the tables were cleared off quickly, there was a bit of trash on the floor here and there throughout the restaurant.this location is quite a bit noisier than the old scottsdalebell road location, but the noise wasnt overpowering. i will be back!
we liked this place on bell and like it here. the food seems the same. the new space seems bigger and better. service was great. it is an excellent place for lunch. there are many more authentic places no doubt but this works for us. i had a super burrito which i have always liked. my wife believes the pollo fundido is the best. the margaritas are good though not great.  i suppose with top shelf tequila and hand assembled ingredients they would be better but more expensive. chips are healthier, that is unsalted which is not a plus in my book.
top falafels!!! came here spontaneously during a conference and un expectantly found some wonderful smoothies and sandwiches!
je suis tombe sur la place par hasard en me rendant vers m4 burritos, decide darreter a la panthere verte a la place. dabord impressionne par le decor et la vibe, ensuite un peu decu par mon vege burger. merite certainement une 2e chance.
nouvelle franchise sur stdenis depuis lete 2015. jadore les falafels de la panthere verte, et jadore leur philosophie, vegan, bio et ecolo. ils vous feront un smoothie dans votre propre pot mason, le tout avec une economie de 0,25. meme chose si vous apportez votre propre plat pour le repas.sur lheure du diner il faut prevoir un peu dattente quand meme moins que pour la succursale pres de concordia, mais il y a toujours la place en salle a manger quand jy vais je prends neanmoins pour emporter au bureau.il faudrait toutefois que je sorte de ma zone de confort pour commander autre chose quun falafusion et un stbasilic ;
awesome place to stop for a drink and the fried jalapenos are great just make sure you can handle the heat. good stop
good food. great beer selection. friendly staff. very reasonably priced for las vegas we visited during happy hour. portions were a little on the small side fine for me but probably less satisfying if youre a big eater.
excellent! its all going according to plan! soon we will overtake asheville and steal the brew city title away!! boo hah hah evil laugh! great addition to noda. a stones throw from amelies.the tap room was pickety packed to the gills! love the decor and the mosaic over the bar! tractors in charlotte? why not!!the beer is pretty dang good  the pale ale was so smooth  an all afternoon hot sun drinking beer. the oyster stout was spot on   another hit. if you can find a seat or a spot at the bar, then come get you some!
im glad to see free range finally got their brick and mortar up and running. having had their beers at a festival or two, i was very much looking forward to trying more. and they did not disappoint. the bobs pure intentions brown ale blew me away  a coffee bomb. they also have a surprising amount of space and the staff is friendly.
like jeff, i also encountered these brewers at at least one festival which seems like it was an eternity ago.  finally they set up shop parallel to amelias and cast.  its a good size brewery with a lot of their tanks in the open.  they have a decent selection of taps and only  one ran out while i was there.  it was quite busy so that was understandable.  there is a small play area for the kids right next to the bar which is a little unusual but its better than kids being at the actual bar.  no smoking including ecigs is allowed anywhere on the premises, including outside.  if you would have told me 10 years ago that sc would take down the battle flag and you wouldnt be able to smoke at a nc brewery, i would have told you that you were high.  i really like the no smoking because it allows people to eat their food from the food truck outside.  chrome toaster was on site and it was good.anyway, this is a brewery so i need to review the beer.  i had the pale ale since it was a hot day.  it was light and refreshing and went down very smoothly.  one of the better pales ales ive had.  i also had bobs pure intentions made with pure intentions coffee and that was good.  the coffee was not overbearing and the beer was not too heavy.  it was probably just a little heavy for a hot day but would be a great fall or winter drink.  i like that the brewery plans to experiment and offer different beers all of the time.  i dont have much of a desire to go to breweries that continually offer the same thing or that offer only the same styles that other breweries in the city already make.  its a smart way to get people back into the business.free range is still a little crowded but im sure that will die down once everyone has tried it.  i plan to return soon.
lovin their bobs pure intentions brown ale! just wish they had flights to try everything!
my first time here and i really like it. the wife and i both are drinking beers we love. we will come back again!!
what a gorgeous place!check out the funky antique store next door thats open pretty late. check free ranges hours as they are closed on sunday funday. bonus points for being across from amelies, cant go wrong there. why four stars? plenty of parking huge they have a whole nother chill space in the back for cornhole and chillaxing seats have backs, yeah im getting old. who wants to drink at a picnic bench all night.  beer? oh thats yummy and interesting combinations.
glad to welcome nodas newest brewery to the neighborhood!  this one has been a while in the making, and as soon as i walked in the door for the first time, i understood why.  the layout and the atmosphere show a real attention to detail in creating a laid back, rustic, artsy vibe.  a few logistical things to note if youre planning to visit.  first off, its only open thursday through saturday.  second, they do have food trucks onsite when they are open including one of my favorites: ooowee bbq. third, they do have their own parking lot.there is outdoor seating, a good sized bar and tables on the inside, and an unobstructed view of the big ole barrels where the beer is brewed.  pretty cool.  the chairs at the tables inside are old classroom chairs and old school bus seats which is a nice touch.so far, ive only tried a couple of the beers:  jenny bought a farm and bobs pure intentions.  bobs pure intentions stood out to me as its a collaboration with the local coffee folks and its really nice if you like java.this place has tons of potential.  i hope to see it make its way into local bars and restaurants in the future.  in the meantime, they have an awesome venue to hang at.
pretty good entry to the charlotte beer scene! the facility is beautiful and conveniently located in noda. mostly light beers still summer time but all good. excited to visit again and watch this place grow!
wow, hip  classy!everything looks so crisp  clean  love the decor and calming atmosphere : they dont have cans of anything yet to take home, they dont have flights, but they do have 4oz. pours that are small enough to carry 3 glasses in one hand!best tip about this place: there is a big tractor out front!
i was super excited to try this brewery after reading the good reviews. i loved the tile display behind the tap handles, let you taste buds roam. boyfriend and i really enjoyed the call me mel  call me f.h. which is a brown ale ask what it means. it will be interesting to see what they do with this space, i think that they have a few great options! i cant wait to return next time that i am in the area!
cool tractor themed brewery.we stopped in on a raining saturday to get a feel for the new brewery that we heard a lot about.  i am not sure if it was just because it was a sat, afternoon, or if there was a family function going on, but man there were a lot of children there.   i am not sure if they just cater to families more, but this is the most childfamily focused brewery i have stopped at.  they had lots of space for them to run and bookstoys  in a corner.the beer was good, they come in small offerings, normally smaller than the standard pint.  pretty much everything was easy drinking and could be enjoy on any type of day.     fun thing, try and see how many tractor logos are stationed around the building. tshirts dont count.
just when you thought noda couldnt possibly have room for another craft brewery,  and squeezed in between the now old locations of noda brewing and birdsong, free range jumps into the fray and makes quite a splash.  reborn is a garage with a sleek taproom that eliminated the wall between the brewing equipment and the tap room, and creates a relaxing, inviting page that is a nice mix of rustic, artsy, and reclaimedvintage chic that all the cool kids want to see and be seen in these days.now open wednesday through saturday, look for a different food truck each day that makes free range both a spot for a clod draft and a spot to catch a quick, though tasty, meal as well.  there is floor space for yoga or small events and an outdoor seating area as well, a long bar runs almost the length of the tap room with a crisp, white tile backing.  old bus seats and plastic chairs that are a throwback to your school days add to the chill, rustic vibe that runs thru this place. but lets talk about the beer, which is they primary reason you go to a brewery in the first place, right?!  solid efforts here that will run across a range of palettes.  ales, porters and an ipa or 2 are usual candidates, along with some seasonal oneoffs that may be worth a shot.  i tend toward the ipa side of things and the efforts here are stellar well hopped, dry but with a depth of flavor.  if you are luck enough to visit with the double ipa is on tap, grab it and send me a thankyou later.  it is, in one word: awesome.and then there are their collaborations with coffee here free range has parted with local roaster pure intentions to create some unique offerings.  not to mention cold brew nitro on tap all the time as well.  this is a unique feature in a brewery and offers a nice alternative to those looking for something other than a beer.in all, free range is a solid addition to the craft beer scene and their tap room is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  do drop in and share their love and passion for craft beer it shows in both the space and the brew in your glass.
solid brewery in noda. love the open layout and they have a solid selection of beers. i really love it when breweries offer 12 pints! join in for free yoga at the brewery on thursdays!
i think they just opened, but its pretty good! i love how the foods healthy and organic! and the fact that its not that expansive either for good quality food: but the food is lacking a little flavor.. will come back though!
they develop good flavors for the different kinds of cuisines they offer here. the prices are also good and the decor is modern and petite. the only issue i had was that the noodles in my order were pretty dry and there was not enough sauce to stir it evenly. but if youre hungry and cant decide what kind of food to eat, stop here because they have a variety!
i just love noodles  co.  went today with a work group, we had such a diverse order:2 x indonesian spicy peanutudon noodle with porkpenne with tomato cream pulled pork sandwich. mine was good spicy peanut, no meat.  i would wish for more broccoli and carrot though, its not like those ingredients are expensive.  there was plenty of noodle and sprouts though. so glad they opened a location on the north side!
i love the idea of this place, but they miss the mark in several ways.the good:portions are a nice size, the kids enjoyed the dishes they chose and the thai hot pot was deeelishthe bad:some noodle dishes were bland, like the indonesian peanut dish. some dishes were also overpriced. who would get pad thai here when its the same price at the thai house? biggest offense, though was that theres not a kids menu. youre told to just get your kid a small bowl, which is still 6. add onto that a drink and a side of bread.... my family of 5 walked out 44 poorer and we all got water.bottom line:some good things on the menu, but leave the kids at home and dont be surprised if youre supplementing your dish with siracha
i really like this place. the food was above average and very flavorful. i honestly forgot what i ordered but i remember being pleasantly full. the portions were huge! i have a nut allergy and i appreciate them takin it extremely seriously. you cant always find service like that. prices were a little above average for what you get but i can say it was worth it.
we went again last saturday and it was open.  this place has a huge outside back patio. the dogs loved it and have a big area to play in. the only thing was it was cold and they didnt really have any heaters and they only have canned beer no beer on tap. but it is def a great place to go when its nice out and to bring the dogs. much cleaner than dog bar
the places are really nice for the rent brand new. cons: sprinklers are noisy they scream a lot! and floorsceilings are kind of thin if in multistory building, walks stomps, and even talking or...other activities....are easily transferred into your place. budget beware: because of the size of water meters they have....your water rates could be significantly higher.pros: good neighborhood and no issues with the staff. granite countertops, stainless appliances, and wood floors except for the bedroom, its carpet
a friend suggested we meet here for coffee, as she is a local i was more than happy to trust her. this cafe is directly across frompart of the markets. it was a sunday afternoon and it was bustling with people. we ordered our coffees and looked for somewhere to sit. however there arent that many places inside just small tables and a long bench, we were a group of 3 so it didnt really suit. we had our coffee in hand within a few minutes, and as there were no seats available outside, did what many others were doing, sat on the kerb and drank our coffee, chatted and people watched: the coffee was lovely and creamy. definitely would go back, they also had kombucha in bottles and a large area for coffee beans etc. which is why there are no tables inside as its all taken up by product
boldest, most delicious and notably the most beautiful cappuccino ive ever had  and ive sipped on few. the perfect pick me up to start your exploration of the marche jeantalon or the perfect conclusion. the cappuccino costs about 4 which id happily pay again for the same result. exudes cool, minimalism design was well though out. i walked out of there with more knowledge about coffee then i did walking in as they took the time to add some fun and interesting details about the process and even about the adventures of the company. this coffee place was more of an experience than just coffee for me. ill be stopping by again next time im in town.
went to see antman today! took mom and we had lunch at pizini before the movie. we did buy our tickets and pick our seats before lunch. the cashier was not super welcoming, i had to ask where do we go? how do things work? at pizini they seemed to be overwhelmed at the register, but the pizza and salad were fast and fresh! the pizza was thin and toasty, made in a brick oven! once we got to our seats we were happy to see comfy leather recliners, it felt like i was at home! movie was great, although during quite parts you could hear noise through the wall. i wasnt excited to see unattended children running around like crazy at the entrance either! i would go back for pizza and a movie, next time we will take pizza in to see the movie!
i have enjoyed this place every time i have gone. its a nice place to get out of the heat and go bowling, mini golf or watch a movie. the prices are very reasonable but i do find the games to be a bit pricey but still a fun place to go to. i like that i can sit back and drink a beer while watching a movie!
took grand kids age 5  6 and had a great time.  played video games.. they all worked! so many places have broken ones.  fun, newer games too.  kids loved it.  we didnt bowl or golf but plan to go back and do that.  we did have pizza and it was really good.,. better than i expected.  the place is very clean.  1 a game i guess is reasonable these days.    they do have special pricing for different price points.  great experience.   we will back!
my boyfriend and i are very pleased with the cinema. we will have to go back and see how we feel about the rest of the establishment but i like that it seemed to be a good mix and more upgraded version of amazing jakes. we are excited to return.
loved this movie theater so much, i dont think ill return to a harkins or amc any time soon unless my movie of choice isnt playing there.  the assigned seating alone is enough of a reason.  we got there about 45 minutes before the movie started, bought our tickets, and were able to enjoy a beer before the movie started.  a great experience overall.  i give it four stars because i could hear the bowling alley music while watching the movie... id recommend a little more soundproofing on the exit doors in the movie theaters.  nitpicky on my part, but still.. it was distracting.  we will be back though, very soon!
brandon was invited to a birthday party here and we found out that they have a theater with reclining seats and you can order your food and they bring it to you at your seats. its pizza and panini and other stuff. food is not that good but it was very comfortable and not very crowded. we saw mission impossible. loved it. we will be back just not that often only because we get discounts at harkins.
i love the movie theater here, leather seats, reclining, food delivered to you from pizinis, great prices, whats not to like???? ill be watching movies here instead of harkins from now on!  plus they have awesome bowling and cheap mimi golf thats pretty cool!!!!
fat cats is a family fun center that opened a few months ago near my house. they offer bowling, miniature golf, dinein movies, arcade games, food and drinks. for the most part its a lot of fun, but there are some minor drawbacks to it. for starters, if you are a serious bowler, the lanes are to dark to see the markings on the ground that help you set up your bowling shot. the extra large video screens also cast a big reflexion on the lanes as well. again, this is a family fun center not an amf lanes, so if you remember that youll still have a good time. the miniature golf is okay, not great. im not sure how they would improve it really. it just seemed flat and hard to follow where to go next. small children like the glow in the dark aspect behind it. the dinein moves are awesome. if youve ever been to one youll know what i mean. i just wish you could find their movie times on something other than their website. the arcade is always a pleaser. although if youre hoping to buy big prizes with the tickets you win its gonna take a while. the food is, well, pretty much like chuck e cheese food but the kicker here is, they have a fully stocked bar!!! that will numb any parents anxiety of feeling like they are at chuck e cheese!
i have been to the recline and dine about three times now for movies.  i must say, most comfortable place to see a move ever.  the 2nd time my husband and i went, we watched a movie all by ourselves, it was like a private screening, i hope business picks up so they stay in business, great concept.  this last time there were some glitches in service, we got our tickets, ordered a pizza, a large popcorn and an icee.  when we went and sat down, husband looked at popcorn and said, that cant be a large, so i took it back out to lobby and the manager stated it was indeed a medium and had them give me a large popcorn.  movie started and the pizza never showed up, had to leave the movie and go down the pizza which was sitting at the takeout window, getting cold.  apparently someone popped head in but never attempted to find us, we were in the correct seats.  that is nice about this place, you get to pick your seats.  anyway, we watched our movie and as it ended, the manager came in and announced the movie experience was not up to their standards and so he was going to give everyone a free 10.00 gift card to make it up to us.  we had to ask him what was wrong with the movie, cause  we didnt even notice an issue with the quality of the movie, just problems with food orders.  manager stated there was a black border line at the top of the screen that should not have been there and some fluctuations in lighting...either way, we will be back and will continue to enjoy putting our feet up for first run movie.  we havent tried the bowling experience yet, but prices seem reasonable with a package deal for bowling, pizza and shoe rental all included for less that 70 for 4 people, i believe.  in regards to food, i tried one of the salads, which was delicious and people with me have ordered the pizza and said they are good, so give them a try!
great place for a family night or a date night.  food is just ok, but i figure you cant be all things.  reclining movie seats are the best!  tickets are not much more than the regular theaters.  call and get your movie tickets rather than waiting to buy there.
love this place. super convenient to be able to select seats online then show up for the show. not the best service at the snack bar and it would be a bonus if you could take cocktails in the theater but i understand it is a family place. very clean and comfortable.
this place is cool. they have a small arcade, bar, mini putt, and bowling. the atmosphere is clean and friendly staff, although they try to tell you about too many deals at one time. it seems like they are trying to get the word out about all their awesome deals by telling you about all of them, when your trying to pay. its very over whelming.. the pizini restaurant that is attached, is ok. i ordered pizza, and probably wont order it again. the size was decent but the pizza was soggy. the crust was too thin its not a thin crust pizza with too much sauce. i will try a salad next time. the theatre was great! smelt clean  new! the chairs are still in great condition and even with them open there is still walking room in front of them. it would be nice if they had trays for the food, so you wouldnt have to eat off your lap, but thats just a minor detail. its a great place for the whole family and i will return.
my wife and i took the kids to this theater and it was well worth it. every seat in the theater are leather recliners!!! the prices were the same as their competition. we noticed that every tuesday is all movies are 5. what a deal!!!
cool place.  took my wife and son to the recline and dine movies. overall, pretty cool spot to check a flick.  prices are decent, the place is clean, and comfortable.  i like the idea of reclining on a chair.  seats recline and food is served here.  based on previous reviews i was afraid to order food from their pizza place so i have no opinion on the food.  the movie experience was great though.
ive visited fat cats approximately 5 times now and feel like im now able to add a review. movie theater: the theatres are brilliant and i give that portion 5 stars. big comfortable reclining seats. the theatres are kept clean. its the best way to watch a movie in my opinion. great spot! the one negative is that if you choose to order food its very dark and hard to eat without been able to see. food: i have tried multiple meals from pizini while watching a movie. tried pizza twice margherita  carnivoro. i was very disappointed with the lack of flavor in the sauce,  very bland especially noticeable on the margherita pizza as the sauce needed to shine with such few ingredients. the caprese sandwichpanini was very bland, needed salt and they forgot to add basil. i took it back and they remade it... but still very bland. the good... some of the other sandwiches are much more flavorful. the salume italiano  cubano had much more flavor and i really enjoyed. ive had the salume in several occasions and its probably my favorite. their sweet potato fries had good flavor but were very soggy. the pasta salad that accompanies each sandwich is ok, but nothing fabulous.
held a birthday party here for my girls. people here are awesome. only complaint i have is no one calls you back when you leave a message to book your party. otherwise, very very good hosts.
went there for dinner and a movie. pizza was great and the theater is clean and comfortable with the reclining leather chairs.
went last night for the first showing of star wars and i am sold.i love this place they could ad a few more arcade games but its all around fun.great drinks,the movie theater rocks! i will never see a movie anywhere elsesuper comfortable seats great sound system i had a blast and will return
love the reclining seats in the movie theater and like the assigned seats. bowling is fun with the family. indoor golf is a quick, cheap escape from the heat in the summer. facility is clean and service is consistently good.
i was actually chatting with james w just this week and he mentioned the amazing four cheese pizza at nova, so when weekend work mode required pizza, i was happy to find that this spot is on deliveroo and promptly ordered a pizza and a calzone as back up.i hadnt realized it was a 100 veggie restaurant but it actually made my late night pizza binge feel a little bit more healthy. it was nice to note that their menu is chock full of gf and vegan options. they are definitely tucked into my back pocket for future party catering  sometimes its tough to find a spot that covers all your bases but still keeps the carnivores happy.the verdict on the food? i was pleasantly surprised. first off, their dough is incredible. honestly, i could just eat the dough all. damn. day. i was a bit skeptic about their nutella dessert pizza, but after this dough love fest, id definitely give that a go next time around. i ordered the mozzarella and veggie ham calzone and id pass on it next time around. i was expecting the veggie ham to be in chunks versus slices and as much as im not opposed to veggie meat replacements, this one just didnt have enough punch to it. i think it needed more salt or sauce? pretty bland all around. but the four cheese pizza? hot damn! first and foremost, if you are not a fan of blue cheese  do not order this pizza! i happen to be a fan but i could see this turning some folks off. however, if you love a little blue  this pizza will be right up your alley. it arrived piping hot and a good size for such a reasonable price. it is so rich! i can usually devour a pizza pretty quickly but only made it through a few pieces of this one before throwing in the towel for the night. that means there is deliciously cheesy lunch waiting for me tomorrow as well. at £8 for the pizza, thats not a bad deal. it definitely piqued my interest enough to return to this little spot somewhere down the road.until next time nova...
have heard great things about this place. i am sooooooooo happy. more vegetarian vegan places in edinburgh!  cant wait. coming to visit very soon. sass
i encountered a problem with the power getting to my laptop. i considered purchasing a new computer, but i ran across stevens ad on craigslist. we scheduled a time and he showed up prompt. he was very professional and diagnosed the problem quickly. although he was unable to fix the issue motherboard was fried he did provide great insight onto what viable options were available to me. i went out and bought a used laptop and steven was able to come back later that afternoon and due some upgrades to it. overall i was highly pleased with pc repair  service.
this was my first time at snooze and im happy to say it was some of the best bacon ive ever tasted and the coffee is excellent too. not sure about the dancing oyvey but its another great addition to the downtown gilbert dining scene.
not sure i get the hype. food is definitely unique, but when it arrived, fell short of the wow factor. my boyfriends burrito was cold and the bean flavor was overwhelming. im sure they would have fixed it for us, but he ate it anyway. my hash was just okay. we did split and mix and match eggs benedict that was pretty freaking good. we sat at the bar and service was top notch, seriously great bartenders and delicious coffee cocktails. ill be back for sure, but im not in love yet or anything.
i really love the interior design and the free coffee during the wait. we went at 7:45 to avoid the rush but we still ended up waiting about 20 minutes. i cant imagine going during peak times. our waitress seemed really busy but she was super nice cause she even wrote on our to go boxes which pancake is which cause we were confused earlier. the food was good but it wasnt anything extraordinary. if the wait was longer, i would have no problem going to some other breakfast place.
love the pineapple upside down pancakesperfecto! they were recommended and were all that.  the fact that you can have a flight with choice of pancakes and even have french toast with it sets snooze apart from any other breakfast place ive been to....and ive been to a few! unique decor gives the interior character.looking forward to my next visit! will definitely try the coffee.
food was bomb... we ordered the benny duo which our pick was half of benny goodman and half a chili verde benny 4 us, very good food and well worth the wait!! we also tried the upside down pineapple pancakes n cinnamon roll pancakes which were nothing short of excellent. love this place and cant wait to come back to try different things on the menu jessica our waitress was phenomenal!! mimosas and bloody marys were also great too!! my new addiction
just visited snooze for the first time today with my work team for breakfast. i would say that the atmosphere, food, and friendliness of the staff is super! but, we sat outside and there are no fans or misters. we asked if they had anything they can turn on  because we are all hot and sweaty, and they said they like to preserve energy so they do not have either.  in arizona, when it is 100 degrees by 9am and you offer outdoor seating, i think you should offer misters or fans. i understand and appreciate the thought of preserving energy and water, but when you are only open till mid afternoon, you wont have to run them as long as other businesses that are open all day long and can still be energy efficient.  we were all dripping sweat by the time breakfast was over. the food was good, and i will be back, but i will try to sit inside next time if the wait isnt too long. glad they opened snooze here in gilbert. gilbert is where its at!
we split the breakfast pot pie and the sweet potato pancakes. both tasted great. everything on the menu sounds great. downside is an hour wait sunday about noon. and it was very warm in there. i was sweating while waiting. i heard that crowds are less before 8 and after 1.
i love snooze i have been to the main location in phoenix and to the one in tempe i was apprehensive to try the gilbert one since it just opened and probably needed some time to work out any glitches that any new restaurant would come across. i came in right before closing they seated us immediately. the waitress was sweet and kind, the food was very good and comparable to the other locations with one exception  the hashbrowns. i dont know what went wrong there but they were not good and thats normally my favorite part. they were dry and unpleasant. everything else though was perfect. i dont understand the complaints on time  do not try to come here on a saturday or sunday morning and expect to be seating within 2030 minutes. its a very popular restaurant and its rather small space for interior seating. i highly recommend just not at a high volume time.
love snooze. i had eaten at the san diego restaurant several times while living there so i was very excited to see it opening up in gilbert. food is delicious, service has been great. however, i feel that a mister system is necessary given that the waits are often lengthy. other than that i have no complaints!
tried snooze in gilbert as it is new to the area and my wife and i love breakfast.  good stuff here.  we arrived around 7:45 on a saturday and had to wait about 20 minutes.  thats a long time for being that early!anyhow, although it was very nicemodern, the decor reminded me of the breakfast club in scottsdale...not a bad thing.  the menu had a wide variety of breakfast food, all of which sounded great.  my son got the kids pancake, which was very good.  wife ordered the breakfast burrito...when it arrived not only was it huge, but fill with top quality ingredients and great tasting.  i ordered the eggs  bacon a breakfast staple.  eggs were good, bacon was sweet, which was nice.  hash browns were a little different as they arrived in a perfect circle.  they were good, but not the best ive ever had.overall we had a positive experience and will return.  we will add this to our breakfast rotation.
first off i will start by saying i will never eat breakfast anywhere but here ever again!! i ordered the blueberry danish pancakes and can honestly say they were the best pancake i have ever had!! the lemon in the middle made the pancake over the top!! it was a party in my mouth!! the only reason for the four star is the wait.  we were told 1520 and we waited for 35 ... the staff was very nice about the extra wait and apologized profusely!! will be eating here as often as possible :
i cant get enough!! im so glad there is a snooze closer to me know.
went friday around 9:30. it was busy and we had a 15 minute wait. its really loud. i told my mom she wouldnt like it due to not being able to hear well. i had my two year old with me so i think loud restaurants work for us. i had the eggs benedict. they were very good. im eager to try the different variations. my son had the scrambled eggs, hash browns and toast. he was happy. we had a really friendly server and the food came out fast. the pancakes at the table looked great. i will want to try those next time we go. the only improvement needed  more attention for coffee refills. my server offered me a coffee to go so that made up for it :
the food was delicious had the benny duo and service was attentive but it was unbearably loud inside. i actually opted to sit outside. for brunch. in arizona. in august.
just went here yesterday for the first time. got there around 8:45 and was quoted a 10 minute wait. that time was spot on. the waitress cant remember her name was wonderful. she was very helpful and upbeat. tried the pancake flight as an appetizer and they were delicious! perfect way to start the meal. then had the spuds deluxe. it was very good, i just wish it had more of the fillings i chose and less potatoes, because the amounts were very unbalanced. overall it was a good meal and a cool environment.
had the chilaquiles benedict with barbacoa and it was fabulous! the hubby had the snooze burrito but it was lacking egg and was a bit dry without adding meat. we had them bring out a side of barbacoa and avocado and it took away the dryness. both dishes had great flavored though! if you hate crowds avoid coming here on a sunday because its their busiest day. also, if you put up with an obnoxious drunkard in the restaurant your server will likely give you the pickle discount which is 20 off your bill!!! well be back!
this place was delicious. dont get me wrong, it is very pricey. breakfast for just myself was 22. drip coffee was decent, but nothing to write home about. peanut butter cup pancakes are out of this world. give it a shot, just bring your wallet with you.
i have been to snooze a couple of times now, we go really early to avoid the lines and wait times.  i have tried the breakfast burrito, breakfast tacos and the danish blueberry pancakes so far, and they were all great.  my nephew has been ordering the pancake plate which allows you to mix and match your pancakes, he didnt like it, but i finished his bacon pancake which comes with gravy and loved it.  this is a wonderful addition to all the new restaurants popping up in gilbert, the service has been good, we will be regulars.  try a game of corn hole or ping pong out back, my husband and i always have a very competitive game while there, so far we are even on wins !
we tried snooze for the first time this morning.  im starting with 4 stars, but if the service and food are as good the next time, ill upgrade to a five star rating.we arrived at 6:40 on a saturday, shortly after they opened.  there were already 1012 people in the restaurant.  we were seated immediately, and had a server get our drinks as soon as we sat.  she took our food order promptly, and the food arrived about eight minutes later.  i had the corned beef hash.  the eggs were done perfectly at overeasy, and the hash was as good as the corned beef hash at butters in scottsdale the best ive had up to now.  my wife had the pretzel roll breakfast sandwich. she specifically asked for hard cooked bacon, and it was cooked exactly as she asked. the server brought the bill as she noticed we were done, and she handled it quickly.  the total tab for two with drinks was 22.58.  this is the same as we normally spend at any other local breakfast restaurant.there were about 3040 people in the restaurant by 7:15 when we finished, and more were arriving steadily.  its certainly popular.the decor is reminiscent of the jetsons  a blend of retro sixties with a modernistic setting circular booths in the middle of the restaurant.  there is a substantial bar focused on morning alcoholic drinks, and there is a reasonable selection of specialty drinks.  there is a small fireplace near the entrance with sofas for anyone waiting to be seated.we added snooze to the ranks of biscuits, black bear diner, t.c. eggingtons, and liberty cafe.  well be back, and ill update the rating based on future experiences.
first time here and came in for a saturday brunch around 1pm. overall this was a great choice for a weekend brunch and will be going back.seatingatmosphere  greeted when we entered and after short wait for a table to open we were seated. very pleasant staff. open format, music, great for families or adults. it is not quiet and i can see where the music volume is close to making it unenjoyable. too hot for the outdoor seating but will go back when the weather cools down to sit outside. service  very good, she was pleasant, smiling and covered everything. i wouldnt call it fast but they were full. service speed and attention needs to pick up to get to 5 stars. everyone that worked there seemed to be having fun, keeping the atmosphere upbeat.food  everything was very good. mmm mmm mimosa  the best morning drink ive had in a while, the pomegranate liquor added flavor and worked with the oj. corned beef hash  a good portion of corned beef hash that worked with the caramelized poblano chilies they added. the hash had chunks of corned beef mixed with the hash brown, not soggy like ive had at other locations. eggs were cooked perfectly to my order.  omg fresh toast  cant say enough about this dish, perfect blend of flavors. stuffed with mascarpone and then topped with vanilla creme, salted caramel, fresh strawberries and toasted coconut.  it had a perfect balance and wasnt overly sweet.really cool menu with at least four more items that i want to go back to try, which will be very soon. then ill go back to try them all a few more times.
my family and i tried snooze for the first time recently and it was amazing! out of the nine of us there was not one complaint about the food. i personally loved their cinnamon roll pancake we shared this as a group appetizer of sorts and the nutella french toast was to die for! my only complaint is the wait time at least an hour and that they dont take reservations. my family and i love to all go out to brunch together once a month, but its a big group of usually about 10 of us. when restaurants dont take reservations it can be hard to accommodate such a big group and its usually a long wait. the food was worth the wait, but without reservations we cant make it our regular brunch spot.
good food . cute atmosphere. i like.there are vegan options.good portions. long wait. 1st visit today. granted it was busy and a sunday, but our service was okay at best....coffee and water sat empty. food arrived missing some items vis a runner. had to flag server down for extras like hit sauce, syrup, ketchup, refill on coffee, water etc. i would go back....but was ultimately a little unimpressed compared to other choices.
food is good there. wait is ridiculous, i guess that happens when you are new  and popular. this location is ideal for those who want to feel safe and sheltered. parking  was a pain. service was pleasant but our food was cold to the touch, management more than made up by getting out more food pronto. so biggest issues was long wait and cold food but ...once  everything was corrected then very good brunch.
met a friend here around 1130 on a weekday and sat at the bar. only about 10 other people there so not busy at all. the bartenderwaitress actually commented on how slow it was that day. my friend had the bloody mary with siracha and i had one of their cocktails cant remember the name, but it had tequila in it and both were very good! i got the chili verde benny and it was delish!! the hashbrowns were ok, but for me combined with the benny a little much. i learned i could get fruit if i wanted...next time! my friend had the strawberry spinach salad, a bit small for the price and had no protein. would go back again!
took my daughter to breakfast waited an hour. the service was amazing the food looked and tasted superb!! only complaint i had was the food arrived  luke warm and i thought it should have been a little warmer.  other than that we had a wonderful time! we will be back.
great food with a wide selection of breakfast items. this place is always busy! so go early or have a tiny snack before you go.  they definitely have a little spunk to their style. youll enjoy the food and tge atmosphere.
im a fan of this place although the wait times are forever. never been disappointed with the food or service though! plus my server added some baileys to my hot chocolate. delicious!!!
lets start with the service, its not that great. waitresses are unfriendly and treat you like they are doing you a favor by doing their job.the food however is wonderful. the eggs benedict are so good. they have so many options and all are great!
snooze is best if you get there before 8:30am. they are one of the breakfast places that got it right for seating  outdoor seating in the front  back plus indoor. wait time isnt so bad. we each had the duo eggs benedict. i had both the bennys  definitely recommend. my husband had the chile verde benedict  also recommend. overall, greatfriendly staff, good menu choices and the bloody mary mix is good. maybe someday theyll start rimming the glasses and up the garnish.
good breakfast. good service. the only thing i didnt like was the music was up so loud that you had to almost yell across the table just to talk to whoever you were with. its in a great location in oldtown gilbert.
had breakfast here with a friend. we waited for about 25 mins for our table. we ordered the eggs benedict and was perfect. the waiter was nice and loved the ambiance.
good food and service. not long of a wait but we got there real early. i am looking forward to going back and trying more things.
great service and great food. our server was friendly and checked on us an appropriate amount of times. food didnt take long to come and was nice and hot.
updating my review on snooze. previously we have a pretty poor experience. after writing my review the manager asked me if i would try it one more time and we did. both of my boys are under the age of two so when we bring them its a true test of the restaurant as well as a test of my patience : snooze did great! they even catered to our need for special seating. when you have a kid in a high chair and another in a car seat things get tricky when it comes to that. ramon made sure our experience was excellent and it was thanks to him. i ask the ham benedict which is what i got last time and it was great! the hollandaise was on point and super filling. my husband got the chillaques benedict and he loved it. like really loved it. i was only allowed one bite. and that one bit was really good. my 2 year son got the pancakes and he loved those as well. the kids meals are actually pretty big. it came with a pancake, hash browns and fruit. which was really great. i had the local iced brew coffee and that was really tasty. not too bitter which some cold brews can be that way. my husband had a mocha which is his staple coffee and liked it as well. we also sampled the gingerbread hot cocoa which was their special for the month and that was seriously good! it tasted like cinnamon toast crunch and the gingerbread man had a baby!! yum yum yum. so im thinking our visit previous to this one today just must have been an off day. which happens to everyone. its a busy restaurant and you cant expect perfection which such high volume. i can now say this company takes pride in their staff, customers and food. we will definitely come back, but maybe not at breakfast rush hour on a weekend : cheers to you snooze! and thank you for making our breakfast great today!
i really wish this place was in orange county! we came here nearly twice a day during the xmas holiday weekend for breakfast or a snack or whatever. lucky for us, their hours accomodated :dwe tried the huge parisien macarons, theyre like the size of my hand, my goodness they are large aaaaand the blueberry muffin, the croissants, almond puff pastry,  apple tart, and more. every single pastry item was delicious and perfectly sweet. i hate it when pastries are dry or overly sweet or bland  thankfully, bouchon hit the nail on the head for me!the packaging is pretty cute too so some of the items would make nice gifts i suppose.bouchon bakery is located next to the main elevator section and the theater, tucked under the escalators.ugggh i want some nao peese!
bouchon bakery in vegas is not as nice as the one in ny, but the goods are still, er, good, haha.the macarons  oreo cookie are both good, just as they are in the ny location.i make it a point to stop by here at least once when im in vegas  my only complaint is that some of the counter people can be very holierthanthou. ironically, the ones working the ny bouchon bakery are pretty nice  friendlier than the ones the vegas bouchon bakery. which is pretty ironic considering the vegas counter people work at a lowerlevel version of this place which is really just a small counter in front of a theater, with no place to sit to enjoy the food  coffee.but still ... the macarons always draw me back here. cannot say no to all that almondey goodness :.note: do not shove bagged macaron into your shoulder bag  eat in hotel room. i made the mistake of doing that once  had to eat the flattened contents by licking them off the bag they put it in :b. not my finest moment!
hidden behind the escalators, by the theatre in the venetian!  tastes just as yummy as the bouchon bakery location in napa valleyyontville!  delicious coffee, pastries and macaroons.we decided to grab some breakfast at bouchon bakery because we figured it would be the quickest way to grab a decent breakfast.  fav pastery so far is the chocolate croissant! delicious!
having been to bouchon bakery in yountville, i was slightly disappointed in the selection at this location. it is a decent selection and they do have specials, but they dont carry items like the chocolate covered macaroons. the larger macaroons also arent as large as the macaroons ive had from bouchon in yountville although the price is still the same. they have a special where you can buy 5 macaroons and get 1 free. you can choose your flavors or they have some prepackaged. the macaroons themselves, although not as big as im used to, are still really delicious...even a couple days after theyre good! now that i know where this location is in vegas its by the theater in the venetian, i will definitely make sure to stop in for a treat. it wasnt busy at all either when we stopped in the afternoon on a weekday.
there are few bouchon bakeries at the venetian, and this location  the one near the theater was a little hard to find. my family had the macarons, and we had one of each flavor: chocolate, coffee, pistachio, raspberry, salted caramel and vanilla. it was a special buy 5 and get 1 free. their macarons are huge and the perfect size for sharing, full of great flavor and sweet. my faves were the coffee, salted caramel and raspberry.
as a vegetarian, i dont trust french restaurants for lunch or dinner, but for the most important meal of the day, you can bet your baguette that you will delighted. sourdough waffles  even with the name gaufres au levain  sounds simple enough. oh, but you would be so wrong with that assessment at this place. canalized bananas make all the difference. together with roasted walnuts, the fluffiest whip creme i ever had, and warm maple syrup and you will go ooh la la. fresh bail of fruits and nice warm english breakfast tea and i was ready to tackle the day.the restaurant is nicely located next to the pool and you can dine outside on a good day. the temps outside were already in 90s the day we went so we decided to enjoy the indoors. the serving was prompt and courteous, with regular tea and coffee refills. do try them, you are likely to be delighted.
great ambiance, beautiful setting along the venetian pool, and great service. the waiters are attentive, the food compliments the setting with their delightful breakfast entrees and baguettes. i would recommend enjoying this experience to those who want a different setting while in sin city.
stopped in twice during recent visit. line moved fairly quick. staff was friendly both times through.first visit ordered peanut butter cookie butter nutter and peanut butter macaroon. second visit i attempted to order three of the macaroons and another butter nutter cookie. there was some confusion between the person assembling and ringing. after a few shots i ended up with a peanut butter cookie and two macaroons.the butter nutters were so creamy and butter and dreamy. best peanut butter cookie i have ever had. the macaroons are best fresh but hold well for a day or two. soft flaky crust filled with rich sweet creamy ingredients.best cookies and macaroons. so rich fresh flavors. service was good.
after my dinner at bb burger where no dessert is offered, i walked around the corner to this little spot where i got a pumpkin tart.  the tart was very good and just what id expect from bouchon.  the only problem with this small outlet near the sports book and clock tower is there is no place to sit.  it is almost entirely takeout.the tart was boxed which wasnt necessary.  i ended up removing the tart from the box and using one of their plastic forks to start eating the tart.  i soon gave up and picked it up and ate it like that.theres a water dispenser at the bar with the plasticware and sugarscreams for coffee, but it wasnt working.  after finishing, i went to the nearest bathroom in the casino to wash my hands.a great little pastry and a perfect end to a dinner somewhere else!
we are always a fan of bouchon bakery. i had a toasted croissant and my husband had a kouign amann. both perfect for a light breakfast. their bottled orange juice which is supposed to be fresh squeezed was very pricey and lacked any pulp. my only complaint is the small outside seating area. there was a homeless man occupying a table and no one that worked there seemed to care. i suggest that you go sit at one of the indoor seating area near the other bouchon bakery upstairs.
came to this location for some goodies to take home. there are 2 locations, one on the 1st floor and one on the 2nd. if they are out if something you might want, maybe try going up or down the escalator and see what they have. we ended up getting the last 2 ohoh  a fancy ho ho and they were out of salted caramel macarons downstairs but they had them all upstairs. for those who have not been to bouchon before the bakery makes great stuff and you cant go wrong with anything usually. we normally get a couple of macrons and some oh ohs and maybe something else if it looks interesting. the locations here have less than napa but still has a good variety. stop by and check it out if needing to fill you sweet tooth.
pizza very good. wood firedneed i say more? friendly service, very clean. a little on the pricey side. 12 pie wcheese 12.00, feeds about one hungry individual.
very friendly and attentive service. our beet salad was great. we liked the pizza texture but did not like the sweetness of the caramelized onions. i think we just ordered the wrong pizza. savory on a pizza is great but sweet....not so much. we will try a different pizza next time
robust delish flavors in the organic salad as well as the pizza bravo great food base!
some friends introduced us to this little restaurant a few nights ago, exclaiming its virtues as serving wonderful pizza.   its got great views of squaw peak, being as its foreground view is the parking lot.. but no matter.  this space was formerly rented by a fellow named danny who lacked the warmth and personality of a great restauranteur.    the current owners are an australian  couple and her brother and they couldnt have been friendlier or nicer or more accommodating.   they allow well behaved dogs on their patio which is always a plus for us!  the only reason for four stars instead of five is that the pizza after slice number two got to be pretty pretty pretty dry.    but ...we will definitely return!
we stopped by here on a whim on a random thursday night and expected nothing beyond a generic pizza experience. in the end, we were pleasantly surprised with what this recently opened place has to offer!what immediately grabbed our attention is the friendliness of the australian staff that run base.  while servers in most restaurants seem to be running on autopilot, the people we spoke to were extremely pleasant and genuinely seemed very enthusiastic about the food theyre providing. they focus very heavily on using local sourcing and strongly emphasizing the organic aspects of their food.weve been here on two separate occasions. both times, we started with their toasted organic bread, which definitely didnt disappoint. they told me their source and i forget the exact name, but they clearly chose very wisely.for our first visit, we ordered the base margherita and the piggy, which features the eversopopular prosciutto and parmesan combination. the second time, we ordered the el diablo, which features some spicy soppressata with olives and the chook, which includes organic chicken thigh and potato. all of their pizzas use ingredients that are very high quality.  i really like that they have a variety of spiceinfused olive oils available at varying levels of intensity.  their pizza is good, but what keeps it from being great, is their crusts lackluster texture.  its a little on the harddry side, which seems to be a common complaint.ah... now for the dessert. for the first visit, we ordered their nutella pizza. with this, youre essentially getting another pizza that features nutella, walnuts, and banana slices. the end result is absolutely fabulous and if available, is definitely something you must order. just take home what you cant finish. unfortunately, the dessert is only available on certain days due to the time involved in making it.for the second visit, we would have ordered this again. since it was unavailable, we opted for a cafe affogato, which consists of organic ice cream, espresso, and some delicious biscotti which they also source out. once again, they managed to impress us with an affogato that exceeds the one weve occasionally ordered at pomo in downtown phoenix. their biscotti was some of the best weve ever had!well definitely go back and try some of their other pizzas and appetizers very soon. the atmosphere is warm, their foods are delicious, and the people are some of the nicest restaurant owners youll encounter.highly recommended!
great addition to the neighborhood.  we went on a monday night and didnt get to meet carly, though her aussie brother was charming.  the pizza and salads were as good as others have reported.  the selection of wines by the glass is excellent and the pours are generous. even the 8 malbec was very good for the price.  my wife enjoyed the aussie shiraz at 11. our friends chose the salad with the chocolate flavored olive oil  thats something very different....
really cute place. i ordered to go but can already tell service is great! i got two pizzas. the dough is fantastic, the flavors were good ! i added a picture of my mediterranean pizza. really good i just thought it was missing cheese... i like cheese on my pizza... got simple cheese for lids. they wanted more cheese but that could be a kid my kids? thing.i would definitely go back and try it again.
we love the owners and the location. we have really enjoyed many of their menu options but would like for them to abandon their organic theme and focus more on offering great lunch and dinner selections.
new animal hospital and clinic.  doc bivens and staff are great to work with.  no rushing, everything being explained in detail.  suggestions to issue with pet offered professionally. we were looking for a new vet, we found him.  looking forward to a long relationship.
i see this place every day while driving to work. well this weekend i needed a sitter for my dogs i was leaving out of town and waited to the last minute to final boarding. luckily they were able to get me in. i came in on saturday morning no way walked right in took some information from me got a free examination from the doctor will kobe got free examination from the doctor. the doctor was very personable and easy to talk to friendly with colby. the only negative i found is that the prices for the vaccinations or maybe it was just a miscommunication about the shots needed for boarding kobes rabies had expire in august and he needed another one they also needed a fickle and influenza where to when i asked how much each one was i was told 10 however when i got here the fecal was 20 something dollars and the influence it was 20 something dollars which i think i coulda got the influenza at a different location for a little cheaper. but oh well. overall i really like the staff the atmosphere the cleanliness and i will definitely bringing kobe back here for his next boarding and for veterinary care. they also didnt charge a physician fee for him to see the doctor so that was an added bonus so out of pocket today 82 for two days of boarding which is not bad including those vaccinations and testing that he had to have for boarding. if youre in this area i think is a great place to come and you should bring your cat or dog.
i love the care my maltipoo gets here.  however i wont bring him here for bath anymore.  i understand perfectly that they dont do detailed grooming but i asked for a bath and to be cleaned up around his anal area. .my husband on the other hand told them to do a spa day package.  well when we picked him up  he didnt look like anything had been done to him. .if it wasnt for the hint of shampoo i wouldnt have believed it. .as far as his anal area being cleaned he has a perfectly shaved square around  his butt..so ill stick to petsmart for  even the simple grooming. .but the care and service are amazing here! !
definitely not impressed with the staff. the doctor knows his information and is real helpful:
petit cassecroute qui sert des sousmarins et des sloppy joe, i.e des sandwichs fourres avec une espece de sauce a spaghetti bolognaise. premier sloppy joe pour moi alors cest difficile de comparer mais ca va satisfaire les amateurs de viande. service tres sympathique.
this cozy hole in the wall will definitely satisfy anyone looking for delicious comfort food. their menu offers primarily three types of meals: subs, sloppy joes, and grilled cheese there are also hot dogs on the menu along with a few other things so if youre looking for a light meal to pair with your diet, you probably wont find it here. the variety offered in each category will surely please everyone tastes  just dont expect seating for a party of 12, this place really is an order counter with seating for about 8.notables : fair prices and the menu has the items listed with the taxes included quick and efficient  everything is prepared right in front of you in a timely fashion having a horrible day? have a baconpickle grilled cheese and turn that frown upsidedown!it also helps that the man who made my food was really nice  i did not get his name.i will definitely come back
ate here today and it was mega delicious comfort food served up with a smile on small stools in the sun. ill be back for sure, its so great to have another inexpensive, unpretentious, fresh lunch option up in this area. there is a list of sloppy joes, a list of grilled cheese, and a list of subs and based on a cursory examination i am determined to sample them all. today we tried the sloppy joe with slaw and pickles on a fresh baguette roll  amazing classic sloppy joe. perfectly tomatoey, slightly spicy, with excellent ground beef and a little kicky with the pickled veg. we also shared long island sub  chicken, bacon, mayo, some magic sauce, other good things i dont remember but everything was good about it. both were kick ass sandwiches, the sloppy joe has me considering going back there again today for dinner so thats the clear winner but everything was win. there are some chips and cokes available for sale here and of course it would be cool if there was a little more variety in those departments but i kind of love that they keep the accoutrements simple because its all about the sandwiches. its a sandwich bonanza.
yummy variety of flavors and a nice environment. the owner was super friendly and generous with the tasting spoons. : 
the spicy chocolate has set my standard for chocolate icecream. rich spackle defies physics. sadly, there are no longer zany flavors, but the flavors they do have are well made. the spicy chocolate is worth a trip.
thanks to el gritos social media presence, i was able to sample their tacos at their popup event in front of underground butcher. they feature an everchanging rotation of taco varieties, and are masters at flavor combinations.foodwise, i have zero complaints  i cannot wait to enjoy their tacos again! my only request would be to have nonsoda beverage options, like water, sparkling water, or tea. depending on their popup location, you may be able to snag an alternate drink nearby.keep up the great work, el grito!
this small spa in westmount square seems to offer a wide variety of services for such a diminutive shop. they have 3 pedicure chats, 4 manicure stations, 2 massage chairs, and 4 hairbrow stations that i could see. i stopped in here on behalf of my grandmother, who needed to have her toenails trimmed. they took her without appointment, and where all good to accommodate her limited mobility, and did not insist on the full treatment polish etc... when all she wanted was the nails cleaned and trimmed... place seems clean and the staff friendly, although most of the nail technicians spoke neither english or french, which can potentially make communication difficult...
the lazy gals bible.entry 50:i go to great lengths to avoid cooking on a regular basis, so i feel like ive become a bit of an expert when it comes to take outdelivery options. of the thai ive tried, all two of them this place currently ranks in my top spot.its a tiny little place, tucked under the stairs as you make your way into stockbridge. all of five or six tables, i was pleasantly surprised when i popped my head in the door last week  its cozy and cute. would make an excellent little date spot, if you arent like me and a lazy sod who prefers pad thai to be accompanied by pajamas.my first go round, i wasnt overly impressed. i got the vegetarian spring rolls and a stir fried option with crispy chicken the name escapes me and i cant seem to find it on their online, so just keep crispy chicken top of mind when you peruse and i would pass on both in the future. the spring rolls were half decent, but definitely nothing special and the stir fry was kind of like the microwave stir fry options you get at the shop and remember: expert on this stuff. it was decently tasty but entirely unmemorable and definitely not enough to coax me back.except, as stated time and time again: im lazy.which means, on a thursday night when im craving thai food and this is the closestoffers online orderingdelivery spot in the neighbourhood? im going to give them a second chance.gosh, im glad im lazy sometimes! my second take out experience from this place was miles better than the first. for my second go round, i kept it safe with chicken satay, vegetarian pad thai and sticky rice. lets break it down:chicken satay: this may be the best satay ive ever had. it comes with a peanut sauce and a cucumber sauce and just go ahead and dump that all over your meat on sticks. its delicious and well balanced  but extremely messy. hence why this would make a perfect take out anyone who sees you dribble sauce, already likes you enough to watch you eat in your pajamas but a pass for date night munchies dribble privileges come later.vegetarian pad thai  im one of those obnoxious people that roll their eyes when people order pad thai because its so unadventurous but consider me smacked upside the head. this dish is incredibly tasty and the ground chillis adds an unexpected kick. its also nice to see theyre making it with proper tamarind sauce.sticky rice  ok, this is going to sound loopy, but this was my favourite. its surprisingly easy to mess up sticky rice and this was both a good portion and an excellent midnight snack. throw some left over peanut sauce on that bad boy and you have snacking excellence. i will definitely swing by for more of this in my lazy future.so consider me turned  i am definitely a fan of this little spot and am quite happy that i gave it a second chance. its a solid choice for lazy guysgals everywhere within 5 miles...
i see you shiver with antici......... pation.this quote superbly describes this past week, as i skipped past, smushed my face against the window and all out stalked their website waiting for ruan siams new sister restaurant street box to open.did i learn about this little spot because i was taken aback when ruan siam was closed for a week during the launch? yes. was a week without thai take away worth it to have this little outpost right around the corner? heck to the yes. the lazy gal default setting is strong in this one.heres what we know so far:this tiny and i mean tiny place is run by the same folks that own ruan siam just up the street.they have expanded the menu and offer delivery between 6pm  10:15pm seven days a week.they have one picnic style table and bench seating to sit in. its small but theyve done a good job with the space.they have quick meal boxes for those looking for great lunch take away in the area and are open in the afternoons.the new menu items like pad kee maow spicy rice noodle stir fry with galangal, lemongrass, chilli and mixed vegetable are deliciously on point.their curries are still as bad ass as they were when ruan siam was dishing them out.i will be here all the time.more options for great thai food? win.
yay, new thai takeaway in stockbridge. its effectively the new location of ruan siam, with less of a dining room and more of a takeaway and delivery focus. our order was ready after a very brief wait, and we whisked it home to devour it. everything was tasty, and portion sizes were reasonable. at £27 for a veg pad thai, a curry, and a soup, it was on the expensive end for takeaways, which is about the only negative i can think of.
i was in town visiting a friend, and she lived quite close to this new little spot and for days had been begging me to stop in with her and try it out because i had heard their sister restaurant was the best.we popped in one day and for such a tiny little space its laid out quite well and contains a fair amount of seating without being cramped and is really bright and has an airy feel. there were already a few groups of couples eating and waiting on food and it smelled dang delicious.im a pretty big skeptic of most thai places having lived there, and living in canada where peoples palates are not necessarily looking for authentic.this place hit the spot. the spices were incredible and rich, and the servings quite large even for take away! we ordered a bunch of items to try them out, and all of them were wonderful. they even gave us shrimp chips i am a sucker for these! ok, now im hungry again.....
the most exciting thing about moving is exploring your new hood and finding new local haunts. as a new stockbridge resident, i was excited to try some local takeaway options.  first on my list was street box.im a fan of thai and a fan of milder creamier curries especially. throw in a coconut base and thats my idea of heaven right there. so, my glance over the menu was a quick one.  the kaeng sangtong was going to be all mine; yellow curry with coconut milk, potato and peanut topped with crispy onion. yes! and a side portion of coconut rice. yes, please!my dinner dreams had well and truly come true and the kaeng sangtong was a flagrant, delicious delight, leaving me more than fulfilled. the crispy onions on top were a nice little extra and there was the perfect amount of sweetness and heat. portion size was good and i was able to have the leftovers for postwork dinner the following night. thats always a bonus!service was bubbly and bright; just the kind that has you back for more.  that, and the beautiful thai flavours are tempting me back!
nice little studio in a hip part of town. the class i took was pretty laid back for a power flow, but the instructor was super nice and helpful. really nice studio space with a beautiful floor and wall mural. my only tip for the studio would be to pay for pandora or make a real playlist  ads cutting in was pretty distracting.
first off, the new location of sin city yoga is so much more spacious than the last studio. we will not be doing any vinyasas in the driveway here. nevertheless, it still feels cozy and welcoming. the founder and her helpers really put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into this space  from the wooden floors, to the purple painted ceiling, to the chandeliers in the waiting areaboutique, to the large mural in the practice space. there are no mirrors, which i thought would be a problem for me in the beginning, but i have really come to notice how much of a distraction they were in my other classes. im able to focus on my practice very well without them; i cant see myself, but i also cant see anyone else. the only reason im giving this studio 4 stars instead of 5 is that the studio is one large space with a couple of curtain partitions, so a lot of distractions happen, especially in the way of noise  from the front door being opened, people coming in and out, traffic on the street, etc. the instructors are kind about these things, and remind us to integrate the sounds into our practice by letting them go. im working on it. last but not least, the instructors are amazing. ive taken classes from seven different instructors so far, and only two didnt jive with me completely. for the most part, every class has provided a very thorough experience from warming up to cooling down, and have provided a great flow that made me sweat, while keeping my focus on my breath with a good rhythm. my favorite favorite favorite part is that the instructors pay attention to every student in class, providing personal, physical adjustments regularly, which really aids in progressing my practice. this is the first time ive committed to a membership at a yoga studio, and im really looking forward to more time there!
unique cocktails and great bites! i ordered the canard buffalo, duck in buffalo sauce with blue cheese sour cream and pickled jalapeno. they were spicy! it was a small bowl of three drumsticks covered in the special sauce. very tasty.the fries and mayo are delicious!!!! fries are large slices of potatoes.the michelada is like a margarita but with a bit of beer inside. i do taste the beer... to me its odd. i might prefer the asian mary, which is a blend of wasabi, soya sauce, and other juices. that was nice to sip on. the kentucky pear bourbon, belle de brillet, apple juice, and more pear juice was very sweet.wonderful service!! i like the vibe of this dive bar, its super clean and serves delicious food.
really great option in this area. tucked upstairs on duluth across from reservoir this place successfully combines great food in a good looking but comfortably divey atmosphere, super friendly staff, some fun and affordable cocktails. i wish there were more local beer options but theyve made a fair start. i think maybe there is fun dancing here, i hope and pray this is the case. i tried the jerk chicken and it was badass, crispy skin, delicious jerk sauce nice and spicy on a bed of rice and beans, salad on the side to cool things down, super filling portion, really lovely with the kentucky pear cocktail. i was so happy that the food was this good, cant wait to hang here again.
the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting and the service was impeccable. a nice vice sand excellent place to hang out in.i tried a few things : their onions rings are very good. prepared well, spicy mayo sauce was on point... yummy! jerk chicken is spicy... then again, i cant take spicy at all but it was spicy. cant comment either way, i didnt know what i was getting myself into. lol. the asian drink not for me, it tasted weird, tried another drink with gin afterwards, it was really good.overall, a good experience!
les oubliettes is a lovely bistrocafe located just off the plaza sthubert. situated on the northeast corner of the intersection of stvallier and bellechassesquarely between rosemont and beaubien metro stationsles oubliettes is perfectly placed to make the most of both the suns daily arc and the local laptop and lunch scenes. as for sunshine, the cafe boasts huge floortoceiling windows along both south and westfacing walls. with 10 white ceilings and an uncluttered decor, the whole interior space is open, airy, and brightly lit. and as for laptopping and lunching, theres free wifi, lots of seating more than 50 places, and an inviting bistro menu.the overall ambiance here is outstandingly appealing. lots of open space two full bays of the occupied building, lots of plants some large, minimal wall decorations mostly lattices or boxes, which make for interesting shadows, savoury smells wafting from the open kitchen, and unobtrusive music pop, folk, jazz, lowfi played at just the right volume all make for a space that manages that perfectly balanced cocktail of soothing and lively.coffee is good, though nothing to write home about. one odd detail: they serve their lattes in tall water glasses, which although it _looks_ snazzy enough, means that trying to drink it while its hot makes you the unwilling star of a monty python skit. in a touchingly fussy gesture, they knot a small napkin around the waist of the glass, which is obviously supposed to serve as an insulated cup holderbut again, while this _looks_ snazzy, its too small, too thin, and too slippery. see the trend here? this is hardly a deal breaker, but it would be nice if the baristas werent obliged to make a design statement with my beverage.the main issue, as is often the case with bistrocafes, is the food. baked goods are i believe made in house. they taste fresh, but they dont taste as awesome as homemade should. similarly, the kitchen menu which comprises mostly modest offeringssandwiches, pizza, etc. looks greatconcise, focused, and intelligentbut the food itself isnt as well composed. when i tried to eat the veggie sandwich hummus plus lots of veggies, it just fell apart on me. now i dont mind messy as long as its tasty, but this mess was short on both salt and acid cardinal culinary sins. i could taste what it _wanted_ to be, which would have been very satisfying indeed, so that i wondered whether the cooks were actually tasting what they were serving. in short, the food here is fresh and wellconceived, but its only pretty good when it could be great.bottom line: this is a wonderful addition to an upandcoming neighbourhood in montreal, and most of the issues ive cited are both minor and readily fixed. the big draw at les oubliettes is the ambiance, which is easily among the most appealing out of all the cafes in montreal. les oubliettes is already, only a few weeks after opening, a great place to worship the laptop gods or linger with friends over a morning coffee. if the food improves, it will be one of the premier daytime meeting spots in the city.
lendroit est vraiment superbe, jadore le local et la deco en plus davoir des tables autant adaptees pour les gros groupes que pour une causette entre amies. le service est sympathique et jaime bien me menu. seul majeur mais pas desastreux hic, le cafe... il est bon au gout mais fait de facon plutot amateur. beaucoup trop chaud pour etre bu sur le moment  alors que cest exactement ce quon sattend dun cortado en plus du lait mousse comme dans ltemps, soit un gros chapeau de mousse, on aime ou on aime pas, ca se tough et ca fait changement de la microfoam. bref superbe endroit ou jirais faire des apresmidis complets detude et de reunion de groupes! ya rien qui dit que leur espresso ne torchent pas  je vais definitivement revenir.
joli petit cafe ouvert depuis a peine 2 jours. a proximite du canal lachine et des pistes cyclable, le cafe est le seul endroit dans ce secteur de lachine ou il est possible de savourer un bon cafe dans un bel atmosphere. une petite terrasse est amenagee juste sur le trottoir. le decor est simple et moderne. le service fut amical et chaleureux par la barista. mon cafe etait chaud mais un peu trop amer a mon gout. ou amer meme pour un cappuccino. il faut faire attention aux merveilleux parcometres sur le boulevard saint joseph. ils sont tres gourmands.
tout petit cafe a lachine sur le bord de leau. personnel sympathique, cafe delicieux et patisseries de chez rustique. ils ont ajoute plusieurs tables a linterieur pour lhiver et un menu du jour avec soupe, grilled cheese et salade. pas mal pour le latte art aussi. option sans lactose pour ceux qui preferent.
i stopped by this location the other day because i received a 5 coupon in the mail and it was the last day for it be valid. the store just opened last week i believe. the store is pretty big and well organized. i didnt get a chance to look at all of the aisles as the line to check out was rather long. i wanted to basically get in, find the clothes that i needed, and get out. i waited at least 30 minutes to check out. i like this store and im glad i dont have to drive across town to go thrifting. i spent under 10 for a mossimo sweater looks new still has tags, lane bryant shirt, and a fancy blazer. i went on a friday and they offered an additional 25 off with a goodwill receipt from the previous week. i was able to use the 5 coupon too! awesomeness!!!  im a fan and cant wait to come back.
new and clean. i found quite a few good quality brand shirts here that would have cost me triple what i paid if i bought it pre owned elsewhere  like on poshmark. one thing i noticed is this place and other good wills smell like apple air freshener. its not bad but now whenever i smell a glade apple scented air freshener i automatically think of the goodwill lol.
i had been eagerly awaiting the opening of this firehouse subs since i saw it was coming soon! we were driving all the way out to buckeye to eat there. so once it opened, we had to go. i ordered the meatball sub, which is what i had on my first visit, and it was just as good as i remembered. i like how consistent this place is. my biggest complaint was our wobbly table. this place just opened and they didnt take the time to stabilize their tables  chairs. i guess they were in a hurry to open. our table also had some sticky soda splattered on it, which wasnt easy to notice with all the dalmatian spots. but aside from that, this place is great. very happy they are close by now.
firehouse serves up good subs and salads.first, i have to say the service at firehouse subs is great!  the staff welcomes you when you walk through the door.  on this visit to firehouse subs.  upon arriving we were met by an employee handing out menus.  my sister and i were asked if it  was our first visit to firehouse subs.  i said no however, my sister said yes. the emoloyee went over the menu and recommended my sister try the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket.  my sister said the sub was delicious.  i had the meatball sub and the meatballs were very tasty.  i wish there wasnt so much sauce because the bread was very soggy.after leaving we couldnt stop talking about how good the sub was. so if your hungry for a good sub at a great price, head over to firehouse
if your up for a good footling sandwich chips and a drink for 13, then this is the place for you. not sure if im willing to pay nearly 10 again for just a sandwich, myself. they do greet you at the door, food was ready with little wait and cashier was polite. the firemen decor was pretty cool.
the food is really good and the staff is friendly, but there is too much socializing going on. we were the only people here when we ordered our food and when we sat down, a coworker who was obviously buddies with the guy who took our order, walked in. at this point everyone working went to the employee area to chitchat with him and no one was making any of the food we ordered. took around five minutes before anyone made any effort to prepare food. all the employees were really young and it did not appear there was any managerial type person around.  other than this we really like eating here.
here at 9:23 pm on 17 dec and this place is closed up tighter than a ducks butt. said on yelp that it closes at 10 pm. hmm. good food though. thats why i just came outta the house in this wienershrinking cold.
giving yori q a 45 rating with a caveat to be explained later.  suffice it to say with one exception, the food was excellent and ill definitely be returning often to eat here.  review is based upon taste, service, and value metrics.first taste.  we ordered a boodae jungol, corn pahjun, egg jjim, and some spicy dahk bbq stuff.  im going to go ahead and mention the exception mentioned earlier.  anything on their menu which is a hot plate or whatever, with spicy bulgogi, pork or chicken... i would stay away from all of those items.  our dahk bbq hot dish thing was an abomination.  the chicken was not cleaned, so we were eating huge pieces of fat, unrendered skin.  and on top of that, they cooked the chicken, but they did not get rid of the grisly cooked chicken blood.  it should be a standard practice to clean the chicken, and once its cooked to skim off any grisly cooked blood so that the customer isnt eating that.  but every mouthful of it is either fat and skin, paired with a goopy, and grisly cooked chicken blood consistency.  it was basically inedible.  ill go ahead and throw in the value aspect of these dishes as well.  at the 14 dollar price point, everything in that section of the menu is the biggest rip off.  portion size did not at all justify the price point, paired with the horrible blandness, fat, unrendered skin, and grisly chicken blood... if i could give a 05 on the basis of this dish alone i would.  but the fact of the matter is, everything in that submenu of hot dishes is a complete rip off, and until they double the portion sizes of all of those dishes, and remedy their preparation issues, i would stay far away from all of those items.now, with that horrible exception out of the way... the good news is, the corn pahjun, egg jjim, and all of the ban chan they gave us was absolutely perfect and excellent.  the corn pahjun, where it looked way overdressed and oversauced, it was actually quite balanced.  a little more acid in the sauce would have been nice, but it was delicious nonetheless.  the egg jjim was more or less a test of execution of a classic ban chan, which they did well.  it was delicious and well prepared.  the boodae jungol was also quite excellent.  i think my defacto standard for boodae jungol is at san soo gab san in chicago.  and on the basis of taste, yori qs interpretation of it was right on par.  it was just enough spicy.  they did put a bunch of cheap meat in it like spam, and hotdogs, and didnt put any premium meat in it, like chadulbaegee, and put very little samgyepsahl, so it didnt really meet expectations as far as ingredients both in protein and veggies, but it at least tasted good.  so aside from the exception that is that dahk bbq, which should get a 50 out of 5, i will give the rest of the meal a 55.  very delicious.service.  service was great.  a guy named andrew was our server.  he was excellent, warranting a giant tip.  if you go to yori q, request that andrew be your server, he was excellent, knowledgeable, and friendly.  he will no doubt make your dining experience improve on his demeanor, and excellence as a server alone.  in general the food was ordered, and came out in a short time.  our server was attentive, refilling our drinks and ban chan, and being receptive to our comments on the food.  55 easily on service.some things they could have done better with our boodae jungol is to cut the ramen noodles, and provided a better array of veggies, and premium meats in it.  the extremely long ramen noodles made it impossible to serve out the boodae into smaller cups without lifting your arm 5 feet above the wok, all the while hot boodae juice is falling and splashing all over your clothes.  value.  so again, with the hot dishes as an exception, meaning the dahk bbq we got, and every other item in that submenu, i easily give yori q a 55 on value.  though i will say, if they do not correct the portion sizes and preparation problems with those dishes the next time we go, their overall rating will drop on this review to a 25.  but the boodae jungol was reasonably priced since it was delicious, and the appetizers were not terribly overpriced.  even with the horrible dahk bbq, our ticket was 52 before tip, which, if you remove the dahk bbq from the equation, it was very reasonable.  so again, aside from the hot dishes, bbq dishes sub menu, yori q gets a 55 on value.  all in all a 45 experience i think.  they will get repeat business from us.  and well see if they lower the prices on the hot dishes, double the portion sizes, and correct the preparation issues.  hopefully i wont be coming back to this review and stamping a 25 stars on it.  all things considered, yori q is a good place to go, just be sure you ask people what to get before you go, lest you end up with a mouth full of creamy cooked chicken blood, unrendered chicken skin, and chicken fat to eat with your rice.
terrific service with warm and friendly staff. the menu is limited, but very interesting. we had several starters, all excellent, preceded by lovely side dishes, which the staff offered to keep refilling. the only mild disappointment was the old reliable bi bim bap, which was bland. we will definitely return.
very good. food is great except kimchi soup is too spicy. service is good and quick. good for lunch. will try some grill things next time.
came in for lunch, a week after they opened.  i was seated right away and the waiter was super friendly!  he suggested going for a bento box over their fusion fare because they hadnt perfected it yet....but assured me that the authentic korean fare was spot on.   i ordered the bulgogi bento box and boy was he right!  it was excellent!   i inhaled everything in a matter of minutes.... not sure what everything was bulgogi, tempura, rice, a macaroni type of salad and then these gelatinous type of things but it was great!   i also ordered the kimchi soup and that was great too but it took me a while to finish because it was almost too spicy for me.  everything came out to 11.  a welcome addition to champaign!  thank goodness they replaced kamakura...that place definitely needed to go!
excellent food, friendly and knowledgeable service, fair prices. i dont get to champaign often, but i wouldnt hesitate to come back to yori q. this was the first time i tried korean food. lucy was our server and she was awesome. very helpful in making suggestions for lunch and she patiently explained what everything was to four old guys. the food came out quickly and everything was piping do people still say that? hot. the soup, served in a stone bowl, was still boiling. highly recommended.
just had a terrific bento box lunch with a friend. he enjoyed the kimchi soup and chicken bulgogi, i had tofu soup and pork bulgogi. we shared a corn cake too, which was excellent! service was great and prices reasonable. my only change would be to offer a larger range of spiciness, it was kind of mild for us. definitely recommend and will be back!
good korean food and really outstanding service. give it a try!
although i was not satisfied with my previous visit, the cold noodle was well over my expectation. quality of the soup was actually better than most of the korean restaurants in korea.
checked out yori q for late lunchdinner and ordered the bibimbap. the good: for 10, there was plenty of food considering i got multiple banchan side dishes and a soup. everything tasted great and, most importantly, the service was amazing. i was there for maybe 45 minutes and i was asked if i needed anything at least 6 times.the bad:while everything was great, the bibimbap left more to desire in regards to the bulgogi. it was one of those instances where i felt like i took 3 bites of meat and the rest was rice and veggies. but it was only 10, so cant complain too much. overall, yori q is a great korean food option in the area and ill definitely be back eventually.
this is a good gettogether place for friends. food is generally good. i especially like the corn jeon and the bulgogi miniburgers. hot pots are good, too.

great new greek place. we got gyros fries salad and a slice of baklava. everything was fresh and was really good! owner was really nice too and is actually greek. my only complaint is that the baklava is 4 for a small half slice.. for that id expect to pay about 2.50. then again id pay the 4 again bc it was that good. will definitely go back.
my coworker noticed the sign a few weeks ago so four of us from the office went one day and we were the only people there for a while. the next time i went by myself and there were 15 patrons when i left.the food is very good. i only have one very minor complaint which i shared while there with staff but when i was there last week it had not been changed. they need to cut things a little smaller  especially on the greek salad. but everything i have eaten is fabulous and they lost 1 star because you need to use a knife to eat a salad and because my chicken pita completely fell apart because the chicken chunks were so large. but the chicken was cooked perfectly and not overdone which is very rare in restaurants.
good food  service i received my food in less than 5 minutes after i ordered. and the gyro is one of the best i had. fries are seasoned perfect.
quick and easy stop for lunch. i had the gyro and fries combo. it was fresh and hot! the fries were well seasoned and also piping hot. great combo for a good price.
what a nice little place and thank goodness because we liked the greek place that was there before. they have really great product high quality and a superb taste. we really have enjoyed the few things we have had not a scrap left behind. nice guys working here very helpful. its superb for the price get in there and give it a try.
we drove up from gilbert for our dinner.  my husband was looking for a gyros pita so we decided to make the drive. we got here a little late on a friday night. we had the whole place to ourselves. guys dont pass this place up.    its unassuming from the outside but great flavor awaits on the inside.  my husband ordered the gyros pita and added a small greek salad.  i ordered the greek salad with grilled chicken.  so happy with our choices. first of all they do the gyros right.  its gyros on the cone not the strips.  big win.  its so hard to find gyros done right.  with the salad my husband was stuffed.  my salad was huge. actually you could probably share it between two people but i was starving so there was no sharing going on.  i added the chicken and so glad i did.   they gave you two nice sized skewers with all chicken.  no veggies on these babies. the chicken was fresh, marinated, and perfectly grilled. so juicy and great grilled flavor.   the dressing was great too. i thoroughly enjoyed every single bite.  if your in the area and looking for some good greek food. this is your place. support  local small businesses.
if youre looking to stay out of the chains and spend your hard earned money at a locally owned place...this would be a good one. i would recommend the chicken pita....yum!

i enjoyed the food here very much. quick service, friendly staff. ill definitely be coming back again.
i love having another greek option in the hood...spartan is a tiny little gem located on thomas just east of 44th st, which makes it convenient for anyone who frequents the target  costco shopping center across the street.  ive now been a few times for takeout and while it hasnt disappointed, its not somewhere id drive out of my way for either.  that being said, if you are close by and craving a gyro, souvlaki, or greek salad, this is your place!ive had both the greek salad with chicken and the chopped salad with chicken.  if you like dill, go for the chopped!  you cant go wrong with the french fries or gyros either...ingredients are fresh, service is friendly and speedy, and the prices are right.
after walking all day, my feet were aching for relief. i found this place and decided to book for two. they took us in same daynight. we got situated and saw the prices for foot massages. one was 20 and the other was 35. the 35 foot massage was actually a foot and body massage with hot stones, which we went with. i will say it was very much needed and i felt amazing afterwards. the knock off of one star came from the mandatory 10 tip. my definition of a tip is extra, so it should have been included in the price if that shit isnt optional. but maybe its a vegas thing because when i was researching massage parlors, people did mention that places almost demand a certain amount of tip. i had a great experience though, so im not mad, but just a little annoyed; the owner was courteous about it though. it is affordable either way for an all over massage at 45 that you feel refreshed from.
i have to say the massage is so worth it i did a full body and i was so relaxed . i will be honest that they do pressure and persist regarding the 10 tip and had they not said anything with pressure i may have done it or may have not but i believe it should be optional and if not... then they should just add 10 more so customers dont feel obligated but willing to give freely!
i purchased a groupon for an oil change and felt a bit of regret after i purchased it because of all the bad reviews so many chain stores had. this was the only location that had an early opening and i am happy that i came today! yea the neighborhood isnt scottsdale but its not that bad like the other reviewer is saying lol. the manager was very nice and had great customer service. there was a company that came in and needed to pick up a tire machine but that would mean everyone would have to stop what they are doing and help this man put the tire machine in his truck. i overheard the manager talking to someone on the phone telling them they had oil changes going, transmissions to pull, a customer me waiting in the lobby and it wasnt a good time. it was just great to hear that he put his customers first to make sure we got in and out. thanks for that mr manager!
out to supper on a sunday night. had the stlaurent pizza, ravioli soup and my friend has half smoked chicken. everything was awesome. delicious.
fantastic food, but the portions are small and it is rather pricey for the size. every dish we had was perfect in terms of taste and presentation. the pbjfoie gras sandwich really stands out in my memory, as does the fig pastry dessert. as a group of three, we essentially had a few bites of each dish. we shared 6 dishes  2 desserts and paid about 45 after taxes and tips we didnt have any drinks.  as someone with an already small appetite, i left the restaurant 70 full, which is just perfect for me, but i could understand how most people will leave complaining that they could eat another meal afterwards.if you want  wonderfully creative dishes, only had to split each plate with one or two people and you dont care about the price, then this is a great new restaurant to try out. the service is friendly, the decor is nice. you will have a lovely night. just remember, the first seating is at 6 pm and the second is at 8 pm! but then again, with such small dishes, there isnt much worry about not being able to finish in 2 hrs, you just need to figure where to go next to enjoy the rest of the evening!
we bought a new house in southern highlands for my parentsinlaw and needed the locks changed. i had originally called master lock  security the day before and after waiting 2 hours, the technician never showed up. it was getting dark and the electricity was shut off in the house so my husband told them he was cancelling the appointment for the day. they had the guts to ask to schedule another appointment and my husband flatly refused. master lock  security had 114 reviews and a 5 star rating on yelp. i dont know if it was a mishap with the technician or the reviews were fake. so i decided to look for another locksmith company.i found top master locksmith on google and they had 61 excellent reviews and it was the closest one to my house. most of the locksmiths were in north las vegas. i set the appointment at noon the next day and asked the dispatcher to have the technician notify me half an hour before he was one his way to the new house. the technician called me three times at 11:58am, but for some reason, my cell phone did not ring. he texted me also, but i didnt see the message till 12:40pm. i called top master locksmith about my error and they were still able to get the technician to come. they said he would be there in 15 minutes, so i went over to the new house which is 5 minutes away from me. jonathan, the tech, showed up at 1:25pm. he was very friendly and even petted my dog, who was barking at him rather menacingly.i showed him the locks that needed to be changed and he set to work right away. he asked me how many keys i wanted and i said 3 and he gave me 4. i tried to tip jonathan 10, but he refused the tip, asking me to write a review on google instead. the price was different than was quoted from the dispatcher. i miscalculated 2 locks that needed to be changed, but it was actually 3. overall, it costs 45 for the technician to come out and 25 per lock to rekey change the cylinder. since the price was actually more than i anticipated, jonathan took off about 10 for the tax and reminded me to write a review.i recommend using these guys to get your locks replaced. jonathan was professional and congenial. the only reason i deducted a star was because the dispatcher said that the tech would show up in 15 minutes, instead with checking to see where he was before giving me a time. she also quoted me the final price at 75 for two locks; it was originally 95 minus a 10 discount when i complained it was too expensive, minus 10 for writing a review. otherwise, the work was stellar.
while its not much to look at yet, the important thing is that vernon the vc behind vc chaneys knows how to give a great haircut.  conveniently located, ample parking, and reasonably priced?  check, check, and check.  hes also open 7 days a week, which means you dont have to worry about working around crazy barbers hours requiring you to sneak out of work to get a tight fade.  the shop has only been open about a month, so hes still working on the interior and getting a few other things lined up.  bring cash for now, but credit card processing should be coming soon!
great cold brew! tried this spot for my first time today. friendly owners and great tasting coffee. they have soft serve ice cream which was vanilla bean flavor. i look forward to sampling other items on the menu. i would of given 5stars but parking is not convenient. 3 meters to park at across the street or good luck finding a spot!
i love trying new coffee shops when im visiting phoenix, so checked out yelps latest and greatest. i honestly chose be because no pun intended for the cute decor and furnishings. when i got in the green logo on the cups looked familiar . i didnt know where i had seen it until i sat down and overheard who i think was one of the owners being interviewed by a lady and he explained that they had something to do with royal at the market and then it clicked . i think they had those cups there ! the cashier  barista was super friendly and shook my hand when meeting him. my only complaint was that he completely forgot to make our drinks so it took about 10 mins without anyone else ahead of us. he did redeem himself however by giving us free coffee cards for next time for the long wait .i love the space ! it is shared with bison leather goods, monorchid, and a cute succulent place with the calmest boxer i have ever met . jb snyders work is on the wall and ties in the furnishings . so cute . the food also looked fantastic, but i didnt try it .
i came by be a couple weeks ago while sort of doing the meet me downtown walk. i was surprised at how different be is from songbird in decor... they really made the space their own. i had their cold brew and it was fabulous! i really enjoyed it. the husband tried the latte and it was not so fabulous.... it was alright. anyway, the service here was great and the food looks good, well have to come back to try it sometime!
allow me to chime in on the positivity for brew tea. my son and i stopped by for a quick visit to grab some drinks on our way out of town. i knew i wanted to try the sea salt cream since ive never had that before and it seemed intriguing. the lattes are the drinks to order if you want to try this foamy layer of sea salt atop your beverage.  choices for the lattes include jasmine, oolong, mango, and strawberry. i chose the regular size 16 ounce mango latte and added boba, something i havent indulged in for too long. dennis was the friendly and helpful staff member who took care of us. he gave my son a sample of the lychee jelly to taste and that convinced the kid to order the sunset on the beach slushee with the lychee. he wasnt even going to get a drink at first. his drink was a tropicaltasting concoction, a little too sweet for me, but he liked it and i would concur that the lychee is great. i liked my latte very much, as well, but i should have mixed the drink because by the time i got to the bottom of the drink, the sea salt foam was too salty. dennis had told me that i could mix the drink or leave it as is, my choice, but since i didnt know better i chose not to mix.  now i know and id definitely have it again. as mentioned by others, there is a stamp card:  buy 10 drinks and get a free regular size drink.  dennis made sure that we tasted our drinks before we walked out, verifying that we liked them and offering to redo if not: satisfaction guaranteed! the southwest wins again with this place in the area well be back. oh, and the boba was fresh and chewy, not hard at all. fan status.
boba was 05 extremely sweetcaramel tea 05 extremely sweet and did not resemble tea. it tastes like straight up syrup. customer service was 55. they said they would remake my drink if i didnt like it but i felt bad since the guy said he thinks i would like that tea and he is the one who recommended it. i should have just ordered the basic brewers tea as i regret not having them change my tea because it was not good at all. it was light almost watery not thick milky creamy and wayyyy too sweet. i got it with almond milk. it was almost 5.50 and i could not drink it, waste of money. i really wanted to like this place after seeing multiple yelp checkins by yelpers, but that overboard sweetness is not good. i even explained i didnt want too much sugar and too much sweetness and this was recommended. i dont like syrups as powders being added to boba tea drinks which is why its hard for me to find a good place to go. i was hoping this was my new spot, closer to home. unfortunately i cant give them higher stars since what i am paying for is the tea and it was not to my liking. :went back twice since the original time there because i really wanted to like it and give them a second chance. they were so nice to let me try a bunch of teas and i found out some i liked and some i did not. i really appreciate them doing this so i can find the perfect tea instead of making them do the whole thing over which i would feel too bad. i got the okinawa milk tea and the black tea latte with sea salt cream. both were very good and i was happy with them! i think the problem was getting the almond milk last time. i will stick with the non dairy creamer or any other way they suggest making it. trying to make it healthier in this case did not work.thank you for helping me to find a tea i like!
came here because its close to my house  to see the hype since majority of reviews claim that it as good or better than my beloved, kung fu tea! the interior is very nice, simple and spacious. i was greeted by the cashier who immediately gave me some suggestions. i went with the jasmine green milk tea. got my order and told me to try it first to see if i would like any adjustments made to the sweetness level. it was pretty good! still not kung fu tea good but just good. the flavor reminded me of qq bobas green milk tea. the boba on the other hand was nothing too special. it tasted very bland and was too chewy for my taste. i would give the drink 3.55 stars.so in conclusion, the im glad that there is a good boba place in the south west area butttt kung fu tea is still my number 1 boba love. idk man, i think its that awesome boba shaker they have. i will still come back here to try out that sea salt cream that everyone keeps talking about.
dear lovely boba shop that has taken over cefiore...ccccombo breaker! sorry, friends, but this place isnt 55 for me. its close, but its definitely not amazing. ill keep this short and simple. service is great  theyll fix or remake your drink if youre not happy with it. prices are decent, and location is perfect for me you mean i dont have to drive to chinatown anymore?.very little seating, clean bathrooms.drinks are alright, to be honest. the first time i had their boba it was too hard similar to kft but the second time it was pretty good. but the second time, i didnt even order boba so there was some miscommunication there too. every time i order a drink its waaay too sweet. the most recent time i visited i asked for half sweet and it was still to sweet. they had to add more black tea and then it was perfect. i think a boba place that has to keep fixing your drink doesnt qualify as as good as it gets regardless of how willing they are to do that. who knows, they could very well rise to a 55 soon but as of now, i will continue to try out different drinks.heads up, taro milk tea tastes very natural and starchy think of the actual taro root or potato. some people might not like that.there is a stamp card. huzzah!
in spite of only seeing a couple of yelp friends reviews to date seriously, guys, do some writing, the hype machine has been in full force for brew tea bar. its not close to my part of henderson, but i made it a point to stop by at my earliest opportunity, and im making it a point to write a review asap.brew tea bar is one of those asian places with milk teas, flavored nonmilk teas, slushes not smoothies, and also freshly brewed premium teas and crepes. it is not allstar tier in my book yet?, but they did a really good job on most of what i tasted, and theyre at least as good as local yelp darling kung fu tea.they were empty when i arrived before noon although this would change quickly, and they greeted me with a smile and a laminated menu. this menu has a little brew tea bar logo next to what they call their most popular drinks. oddly enough, this distinguished selection doesnt include their namesake the brew milk tea described as a premium black tea with milk.i did end up with a socalled popular drink, a taro milk tea 4.50 for a large 24 oz with honey boba 0.50. they didnt have to tell me that it had fresh taro because i taste it, and i could feel the bits of taro root. at default sweetness, it was not too sweet. it wasnt very sweet at all for my palate, actually. its probably the best taro milk tea in town just because of the natural taro that they use, which tastes nothing like that artificial powder junk. the honey boba was nice and chewy, and it wasnt overly sweet either  after all, it does tend to take on the sweetness of the drink. its on par with what i agree is a great boba addon at kung fu tea.i took a sip of a friends passion fruit slush 3.95. its too sweet by default, and its probably made from an artificial syrup. i might order or try to sample it with less sugar just to get a better read on it. i also tried a classic crepe 4.95. it was a thin shell filled with strawberry, banana, nutella, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream 1.00, and topped lightly with chocolate syrup and powdered sugar. i loved the fresh fruit, reasonably vanillay ice cream, and chewy crepe dough. it was not too sweet, and i might order it for myself if im ever around here and not full andor sugarloaded.finally, i ordered their new offmenu large coffee latte 5.13, which comes with sea salt cream just as their tea lattes do sea salt cream seems to be new to the vegas scene, by the way. they had mentioned it during the decisionmaking period of my initial purchase. while im not a coffee drinker, ive had the famous 85°c sea salt coffee enough times to make a comparison between the two.guess what, folks? brew tea bars version is better. the coffee flavor is more prominent here. although they will prepare it with or without sugar, i had to go with with. now even if they add the same amount of sugar as 85°c, the potent coffee flavor throws the ratio off. fortunately, they will tweak the sugar to your liking either when making your order, or after youve mixed the cream into the coffee and tasted it. although i could have handled the drink with the default sugar level, i requested more sugar and really loved the result. this adjusted drink was still not as sweet as 85°c, which again speaks to the coffees strength. by the way, i still have about 23 of the drink sitting in my fridge since i dont have the caffeine tolerance that others might. this particular drink is worth going out of your way.the service is great. as i implied above, they will adjust and remake drinks until youre happy, which is an awesome policy. they gave egg pudding samples reportedly good, will order next visit, so maybe theyll provide other samples? they add a cardboard sleeve even to cold drinks, and they actually handcut the sleeves to fit regular 16 oz cups. they bring your drinks to you if youre sitting at a table or bench. they also cook the crepe to different doneness levels, provide a buy10getonefree stamp card, and even take orders over the phone.im saying that brew tea bar gets 4.4 stars for now mathematical ocd makes me wanna round up for 4.5, and im even more excited now to try more of their drinks. they seem to make their drinks more balanced aka not sweet than other places do by default, they have good tapioca pearls, and they clearly care about their customers. to me, theyre already one of the best tea  milk tea spots in town. hopefully, they will continue to innovate while maintaining their standards. maybe this also bodes well for the overall boba scene of vegas.
a simple, sweet little spot for tea love the name and the service! menu is mostly beverages, with a small selection of crepes. much like kung fu tea, this spot emphasizes that they will customize sweetness and flavors to your preference. props for focusing on the details: marinating the boba in honey, making the fruit drinks from actual fresh fruit not realfruitbased syrups, and making sure you try your drink before you go to ensure it is to your liking. the coffee latte with sea salt cream is a tasty menu option, made with fresh cold brew its extrastrong, so you may need to ask for it a bit sweeter than youre used to. one of the better options outside of chinatown for milk tea beverages!
honestly i was about to give up bc ive taste tested a couple of their drinks hokkaido milk tea, mango slush, rose milk tea, caramel milk tea and though they were all decent, none of them fit my personal taste preferences. thats not brew teas fault though. then lord, sweet looord i tried the oolong latte with sea salt cream. coming from someone that loves a good strong tea, i cant describe the taste other than heavenly. they dont use any of that powder crap that other chinatown establishments use, and you can definitely taste the difference. i ask for less sea salt cream because i think their standard serving of cream at the top is a bit too much and can overpower the tea after you mix it. the jasmine latte also had a wonderful fragrance. however, the jasmine tea and the sea salt cream dont go together nearly as well as oolong and the cream do. my goto drink is now oolong latte  i freakin love it. i order my drinks without boba because though their boba is decent, its not as good as kung fu teas in my opinion. a bit too chewy and not very sweet. side note: every worker wears a shirt that says the brew crew. how cute is that haha.
its been a while since ive been able to say that there is a boba place in vegas that i actually like going to. ever since fresh cup closed.. there hasnt been anywhere that has been up to par with my standards, until now.brew tea bar is in my opinion the best option for boba and asian tea drinks available in las vegas. ive only been there twice so far so ive yet to see if they have their off days but as of right now both of the beverages that ive had were great and cheap. you know a boba place is on point when the boba at the bottom of your cup is hot and soft. they are also the only place in vegas that can make my favorite drink.. peach milk tea!!!!the service is fantastic. they have a 100 guarantee that you will enjoy your drink and if not, they will make you a new one. all of the employees are kind and knowledgeable of their menu.i think my only gripe is that the venue is so small. i like loungey feeling cafes similiar to the places they have in california where you can just hang out and chill. it might not be as hip looking as kung fu tea or as large as tea station and icy juicy, but what they lack in aesthetic.. they make up for in quality drinks and thats really all that matters in the end.
with all the buzz on brew tea in the very short amount of time they have been open i was almost reluctant to try them. after very little convincing on my fellas part when he was craving a boba drink im happy to say i have jumped on the bandwagon with both feet.excellent customer service, each employee we have encountered has gone out of their way to make sure our orders and experiences have been top notch and the product is excellent as well. each drink i have tried has been incredibly well balanced and they accommodate every request to personalize your drink. if you arent happy with your order they will remake it to your specifications. you cant get better than that. the boba is perfectly prepared as well. chewy and sweet, just as it should be.i will be a regular here, thats for sure.
worth the hype! customer service is on point and the service is quick. drinks are a little on the sweet side so id recommend getting them less sweet or no sweet. if you dont take my word for it and get it served their standard way, i guess it doesnt really matter because theyll remake your drink if you dont like it.
brew tea bar is one of the newest and hottest boba shop in vegas right now. with all the hype on yelp and my friends raving about this place, i immediately jumped on it like a fat kid on a cake. after giving this place few more visits, my verdict is: its not that great.serviceservice is consistently amazing here. dennis, sou and louis really goes the extra mile to make sure you are happy with your drinks. it is nice to know that customer satisfaction is their number one priority. two thumbs up for their service.drinkwhen you are handed a drink personally, they tell you to let them know if you need any adjustments. even though their willingness to adjust your drink is appreciated, i find that drinks are not that great when you have to keep making adjustments. or when they offer many options and varieties of drinks but you only like one drink. i have tried their oolong latte, jasmine milk tea, hokkaido milk tea, cantaloupe milk tea, sunset on the beach slush and black tea latte so far. out of all the drinks i did get to try, i only ever liked and will only order their jasmine milk tea which is sad to say. their drinks just never really blows my mind like every other reviewers says. too picky? possibly. its all a personal preference? true. but all the high praise and rave about this place is ridiculous to me. its overrated. lets talk about boba. boba is inconsistent. its on the softer side, sometimes too soft and mushy. they use longan honey for their boba which is nice, but can get too sweet. honey from boba will dissolve in drink. perhaps asking them to rinse the boba is a good choice. conclusionpersonally after trying 5 drinks, i can safely say this place isnt really my cup of tea.
location is excellent for me since i live in mountains edge. service is fab. everything fees nice and clean. and friendly. the location is probably what causes me to come fairly often as opposed to the other boba places in town. actual drinks seem pretty typical and i do prefer kung fu teas boba over any others mostly because of the smaller size and harder texture. i admit, i dont like soft boba. i usually get jasmine milk tea but one time they recommended me jasmine latte its iced not hot as i thought it would be and i have been ordering that ever since. will continue to be a regular consumer :.
was in vegas this past weekend and came upon this place on yelp to satisfy some bubble tea love and also to cool down from the heat. its pretty new but man are the reviews all positive so of couse had to try it. its a smaller store but there is room to sit and hang out if you wanted. they make their tea fresh and you see the rows of tea leaves. they also have almond milk and regular milk if you didnt want to do the nondairy creamer. i got my signature matcha slush with fresh milk, unsweetened with a little bit of herb jelly. the herb jelly tasted quite like herb and more bitter than sweet. the slush was decent but you can tell they dont use sweetened matcha so if you are not a fan of that, dont get this drink. i liked it and would be back if i lived in vegas. until next time then.
visited this place at night while it was quite busy and impressed that they delivered pretty good service. i frequent a variety of boba places and their boba here is pretty good. i ordered a taro slush smoothie and i didnt expect full pieces of taro to be in the smoothie. though it may be a plus for some, i was not too fond of it, i would have rather had it mixed it rather than big unexpected pieces. the slush was pretty goodwhat i really appreciated about this place is that my friends and i came here and stayed for quite awhile. we actually stayed and hour and a half past their closing time and they were very nice about it, let us stay outside and use their table and even told us to take our time, really appreciated that and will definitely be coming back.
this place jus recently open and its a hit.. located on rainbow and warm spring, next to great clips. used to be cefiore..i order the taro slush and they ask if i wanted real taro on top and of course i say yes.. ive never had taro slush w real taro before cuz no place makes it..i really like it and their honey boba was good as well..cant wait to come back here and try something new
delicious!!!! 3 words: hokaido milk tea!!!!! oh and add the pudding. out of this world. so milky and the pudding which resembles flan adds bits of creaminess. so yummy. cant wait to try the other flavors out.
btb is an awesome establishment. awesome service. awesome location. awesome boba.my only issue would be that every time ive had drinks, theyve always been more on the sweeter side. like im drinking straight up sugar. i love that they do the, if you dont like it you we can change it for you, type of thing, but i dont know, just too much sugar.... i feel like it should be the right amount of sugarsyrup every time you make something. other than that, their boba is super tasty and the right texture. i love that they give you a good amount. but i wouldnt come for the crepes. not the best ive ever had. but yes, do come for some of the best boba in vegas!
im a huge fan of jasmine tea with sea salt cream and this place delivers! back at home in the oc, i usually get my fix at 7 leaves and when i tried it here, i was very pleased with the taste of the tea!the jasmine tea had a great refreshing taste with the sea salt cream; it was just comparable to the one back at home! my bf ordered the hokkaido milk tea; im not really a fan of it so i cant really say  but my bf thought it was okay. stamp cards are available. plenty of parking. the workers there are nice too. take home message? get the jasmine tea with sea sat cream its called jasmine latte on the menu.
chrysanthemum iced with honey 55not too sweet or watered downactually use chrysanthemum flower. none of that powder prepackaged stuff. wow, i love this place. boba has good consistency.i really appreciate that they will remake your drink if its not to your liking. not the typical asian boba run place they really strive for excellent customer service. my only gripe is the place is really small and fills up with customers quickly. otherwise, love this place. would return in a heart beat!
okay so im writing this review because im craving their drinks right now. i have been coming here since the first week they opened and without a doubt, i love it here.first off, their service here is amazing, and they make every attempt to make sure your experience is pleasant. theyre not as attentive as before, but they have definitely gotten a lot busier, so i completely understand. although they may not explicitly tell you, you can customize your drink to make it less sweet or even take on the option to mix flavors. i do think their drinks are on the sweeter side, but just let them know you want it less sweet, and you should be good! my goto drinks here are jasmine latte with boba and the rooibos tea with herbal jelly. there are still a few drinks that i have yet to try, and i do plan to try everything..but i always end up getting my favorites! crepes are also really good. i would recommend getting one yourself and not sharing. my boyfriend and i got one to share and devoured it in 3 minutes..so why 4 stars if i love this place? mainly because of inconsistency. ive noticed my drinks taste different sometimes, and the consistency of the boba can vary. however, it doesnt bother me too much. their place is still new, and i believe that a few more months can fix that problem.
brand new boba place in vegas. they had really good reviews on yelp so i was pleasantly surprised that there boba was as good as yelp said they were.  decor is very minimalistic and fresh much like many of the new boba places that are opening up in socal  norcal.  we were greeted upon walking in, and the staff that work here are all super friendly and welcoming.  i ordered a regular milk tea, and my friend had the rose milk tea with boba.  the milk tea here is about 45 but it is worth it because they make your teas fresh and they arent sitting around pre made.  i loved my milk tea it had a unique flavor.  my friend also had one of their fresh loose leaf teas to go and i was able to try that as well.  it was soo fresh and fruity tasting. id definitely recommend the hawaii tea if you want to try something new. props to vegas for having more boba places! i was getting sick of kung fu tea and lollicup
new, clean and delightful!! drinks came in regular  large sizes and priced reasonably. i got my usual taro milk tea it was really good  you can taste the real taro! my friends tried the iced thai iced tea with lychee  jelly.. it may seem a lot going on but it was also surprisingly good. iced jasmine tea was refreshing. tried the nutella  strawberry crepes portion was good for two. i highly encourage sharing.   be prepared to wait in a long line.. but dont worry it moves fast! the seating area was very limited though. i wouldnt hang out there because the place is small  too busy since its still new  everyone is stopping by to try it! we will be back!!
omg! the iced mango latte topped with salt cream i get extra salt cream is my all time fav drink! im addicted!!! if i lived close to brew tea bar id probably get one everyday. im not a coconut flavor lover but their cocoberry slush is so delicious! its coconut slush with a swirl of strawberry puree. even my daughters strawberry banana slush was yummy too. the fruit flavors in the drinks dont have that fake artificial taste that many fruity drinks do. youre not just tasting sugar. ill have to try their crepes sometime. the staff at brew tea bar have always been helpful  pleasant even funny at times. one star off because their location is so far from me. open more locations! open one in centennial hills! pretty please....
ive heard many great things about this place, especially their hokkaido and okinawa milk tea. when we arrived to check this place out, the workers greeted us and were completely helpful. they handed us a menu and there were some drinks that ive never heard about. they saw how perplexed i was and explained to me about the drinks i was curious about. extremely helpful!their overall service? 55! very impressed with how they handle their customers. i was very interested in the hokkaido and okinawa milk tea since ive heard many great things about it. i didnt know you could mix the teas! i highly suggest you try the teas together with the honey boba, it is to die for. very creamy and the sweetness level was not too overbearing. it was just right to my taste. not a really big fan of brown sugar, but this was fire!im so happy this place exists in las vegas just because there are barely any places where you could combine your teas. i havent had anything taste like this in such a long time. brings back the memories from japan. if youre going to be a regular, dont forget to get a stamp card! completely worth getting if youre going to be a regular here.
i love this place. they have very refreshing drinks. so many choices to choose from. the staff are very friendly. very nice place to hang out.
the boba in the tea are the best boba ive ever had.  crepes are huge and packed with flavor.  the workers were extremely friendly, although not very efficient.  i ended up waiting over 10 minutes for them to complete my order but it was worth the wait.
best thai iced tea around sw vegas area! i been to a few other places, but this place makes them the best. staff is always nice, greets you when you come in. i only gave 4 stars, because they are constantly busy and only have 4 tables inside and 1 outside. i have probably only been able to get a table twice but have been coming here at least a dozen times already in the last couple months.
had the matcha latte with soy and sea salt foam and it was hugh. great taste and and price was on point. short 1 star cause the place was a bit cramped. didnt have much space to get comfy. other than thats good stuff.
been here twice now. first time i tried the basic iced milk tea. a little too sweet for me. also had the ginger hot tea with no sweeteners it was good and had a spicy taste which i enjoyed. the lavender hot tea with no sweetener was also enjoyable with a strong lavender aroma and taste and kinda minty after taste. but my favorite drink so far is the jasmine latte, not too sweet and still has a tea flavor definitely gonna go back and explore the menu.
the drinks here are always good. prices are a little higher but worth it. taro boba is the best, they even include real taro on top.
the reason for the 4 was because it was obvious that tiffany is not the best at customer service by the way she speaks to people.  venus in contrast was excellent!  she made sure i got the pedicure service i wanted and did an excellent job!
very nice gentleman running the place. nice ambience...cute. quiet music. good cafe pumpkin latte and baklava i prefer the walnut onedry.  the other has cashews whoney  water surrounding.  so different from what im used to and im always open to variety. very reasonable prices. note:  no decaf available. that is ok.
cozy coffee shop. came here to satisfy my sweet cravings. mission accomplished. cakes and pastries are delicious.
never did make it to the old s. fields before it closed down, so i have really nothing to compare this place to. however, i quite like it so far. i havent done a ton of grocery shopping here but i have had a number of experiences eating lunch at the cafe so my review will focus mostly on that. first off, the prices are great. finding an all natural meal while eating out that isnt going to ruin my diet is not easy, and finding one that doesnt empty my wallet is even less so, but s. fields fits the bill perfectly . their menu rotates every day and they have both veggie and non selections available. the staff is really friendly and are ready to answer any questions you have concerning dietary restrictions as long as you dont mind asking.... they also have a number of delicious vegan baked goods available. ive tried the chocolate chip brownie and the espresso vanilla cupcake and both were delicious and relatively cheap. i think this place is doing a lot of things right at the moment and i plan to update my review when i get around to doing some grocery shopping there. for now though im happy to add another place to my rotation of lunch spots.
saw this little place driving by on victoria street last week and decided to give it a try.... was not dissapointed!  my wife is quite adamant as to the way she likes her eggs and she got exactly what she wanted.  my sister is on a constant hunt for the best eggs benedict and she was very pleased.  i had one of the best omelettes i have ever had... period.  at first glance the pricing seems a little higher than most other places but look close at what you are getting for your money.  the food is very tasty and there is a lot of it.   the wait staff is attentive and friendly.  we turned down a refill of coffee several times because we werent ready for more.  they are always ready to refill your cup awesome!.  even though we tend to hang about and talk over coffee after breakfast, we never once felt rushed or unwelcome.this place is only open for breakfast and lunch 7:00  2:30 daily, but it has a reasonably extensive menu.  there is limited seating mostly booths and an open ceiling so it tends to be a tad noisy.  overall though, an exceptionally clean place with great food, good value for your dollar and friendly service.
very good food, decent pricing. my girls and i enjoyed a nice brunch here. :
well, as of now clearly the best subs in town. i had the tappy. the menu just says capicolla when in fact its hot capicolla, which was fine with me. they dont put any more cheese on this sandwich than their competitors, but you can actually taste it. im thinking it must me aged provolone.clean place, friendly staff, a little disorganized, but thats understandable since they just opened.definitely better than which wich. and about time we had an alternative to substandardway.ill be back!
unlike several previous reviews i received my sandwich right away.  that seemed to be the case for others as well.  nice atmosphere, you can sit and visit without loud obnoxious music blaring like some sub chains.  thank you!!!  suggest adding ice tea to the fountain area for us nonsoda drinkers.  had the turkey sub. which was on par with milios  jimmy johns.  way better than sub way.  very friendly staff.
a nice addition to sun prairie. good subs with some original favors. good soups, and the service speed has improved considerably now that they got through the growing pains of their first month.
looking for aj nails?  you wont find it. this salon is under new management and has a new name. most of the prior employees remain, so if you have a favorite be sure to ask for him or her.  prices are competitive and the service is very good. even if youre looking for a basic pedicure, you wont find a better one at the 20 price point. it includes a hot stone massage and it lasts more than a mere two seconds.  youll definitely get your moneys worth here!
very friendly service... loved the all you can drink champagne ... good variety in food... omelette bar pretty good and friendly kklm
fun place to go. always a fun crowd. service is fair, food is fair. the world needs more neighborhood hang outs like this. music is decent too. this place is always our back up plan if we dont know where to go. friday is the best day to go. all day happy hour.
went on a friday , very crowded , ok service and ok food ......my beers were ice cold but my sisters mixed drinks lacked flavor
the waitress was very attentive to,  she had long dark hair,  a paste on gold tattoo,  cute and tiny.  the wings we had were yummy,  spicy, and only 4 for 6.  hubby had the tavern cheesesteak for 6.95 for the thursday night happy hour price.  it was delicious!  domestic beer was only 2.50 also.  we are staying at the hotel next door for a few weeks,  we will definately be back!   the owner,  or manager heard is talking about a certain game we wanted to watch on their many tvs and he got up and turned 3 of them on to that channel!  very kind and courteous fella. they have wings wednesday  where you can buy 6 wings for 2.40!  or .40 each.  cant beat that price
i love this place the food is great. four stars because  the waiters are better at serving  being friendly then the women. with that said i want to add when we have had a waitress she seemed to just be there for the job and didnt care to go above and beyond. out of the waiters, andrew is the best. weve been here many of times and he even recognized us as well as came over to ask how our meal was going even though  he wasnt our server. i definitely wont forget to request him next time.
new pizza joint in my immediate area. ordered for pick up because delivery was 4550 minutes but thats to be expected on a rainy friday night. i ordered the meat lovers calzone, 2 cheese slices and the buffalo chicken sub. i also asked for 4 ranchs. the calzone was really good, excellent flavor. if you order it, the greasy looking stuff is butter not grease. their marinara sauce is one of the best i have had when it comes to ordering out. the buffalo chicken sub was a little skimpy but would have been really good if i had the ranch i ordered. the pizza was good, big slices, my 8 year old ate that and said it was the best, i didnt try it. i am really picky when it comes to italian as i am italian and have lived on the east coast and if you have been, you know its hard to find good italian here in az.  as i mentioned i didnt get the ranch i requested but the service besides that was great. very friendly and welcoming and took the time to chat about where they were from etc. i will be going back but double checking for my ranch!
we tried this place because of the reviews. the lasagna was very good and tasted homemade. i loved the garlic not and salad. i will visit again.
great little pizza joint. not fancy pizza but they have landed he new york pies so you can stroll in for a slice. their knots are a must have. support local and stop in. nice to have a decent little place this side of town.
the pizza was pretty good, ny style pie. the garlic knots not the best in town, kinda bland though the dipping marinara sauce was pretty good. they have very nice service, friendly folks. i loved that they are from brooklyn.
a very cute little place in uptown charlotte, with a lil outdoor yard you can sit and enjoy the beautiful afternoon weather and part of the skyline. very nice services, perfect cakes just exactly the same flavor as the manhattan store. a place for date and girls hanging out.
i wish i could give this 4.5, but im giving this 4 instead of 5 because my cakes were not as soft as id like and were pretty cold but still super delicious.if you like a chill environment with good food, good vibes and good art, then this is the place for you. the interior is very nice, and it is a great place to wind down after a long day at work. the service was okay though. when i walked in, no one seated me right away so it was a bit confusing but the waitress was very sweet! the water was also great too cucumber infused i think! get the green tea crepe cake, its my favorite! theyre a bit pricey 89 but i definitely think it is worth a try. i will be back for their regular food!
beautiful art. beautiful presentation. this lovely gallery also serves one of the best almond milk lattes ive ever had. and, unlike most coffee houses these days, the gallery serves coffee in mug, not a paper cup. call me old school but i love getting my coffee in a real cup! the gallery also has assorted treats. i tried the checkered cake and it was delicious. there is also wine and beer. the staff is super nice, especially the manager emily. she consistently makes me feel special and offers me treats to try perfect for my cheat meal splurges : im happy to have them in the neighborhood.
sophisticated yet approachable. i dropped in with a small group on the tail end of a gallery crawl. the owners welcomed us in and served us some sangria while telling us a little about the art on display. a lovely couple with a lovely place. after finishing our sangria, the four of us split a bottle of wine and shared some cheese. nice selection and i loved the baguette, fig jam, and truffle honey that accompanied the cheese. ill definitely be back, and next time im trying dessert.
small place on apache west of rural road with a great location for asu students. not much seating inside but ample outside and good to take out.first time here and a good selection of different variety of poutine. shared the taco poutine and chicken parmesan poutine. the taco poutine had a good mix of taco meat, avocado, lettuce and cheese which mixed well of top of the french fries.  the parmesan chicken wad on the bit cheesy for me.there is a drink fountain along with lemonade and strawberry lemonade dispenser which i had the strawberry lemonade which was pretty good. the service was okay but on the slow side considering we ordered with no one in front of us.have to say the portions are pretty good size and could not finish the meal.will be back to try some of the other poutine
what can i say? you got the munchies, they got the cure.
we had a very good experience with nick and the other guys there. hes a really funny guy and not pushy at all which was nice. the mechanics at the shop and the office are all great guys too. they are very straightforward, a bit tough to bargain with with price and warranty but very fair. nick was really easy to deal with and took very good care of us and made us feel like family.the car was older and the price was fair and he took care of all of the repairs that were needed so the car would be in great shape, new head gasket and axle shaft as well as a new timing belt. we were charged just for the part for the timing belt but the labor was included. that was definitely a good deal, apparently to replace all those parts are quite expensive over 1000 and he included it in the price for the car. there were a few things that we found after we purchased the car, nick gave us only seven days as a warranty which we were worried about but he took care of the problem the day we brought it in broken axle shaft and didnt charge us which was really great. we enjoyed dealing with these guys and i recommend buying from them and getting work done at their shop if you already have a car. they are very honest on the prices for the parts and the prices for repairs are really good, much lower than other places. we will also be able to bring our car back for the next ten years for lowpriced repairs if needed. thanks nick!
are you running low on bcaas or scraping the bottom of your jar of nuts n more? well, forget the days of following annoying fitness accounts on instagram and sorting through the spam ads to get discount codes come here and get exactly what you need.regular prices are about the same as youd find with a discount online, and theres obviously no shipping charge or freeship minimum, and no delay to get your goods! add in that the shop is fairly well organized, there are no annoying sales guys pressuring you into unnecessary purchases, and you get free samples with each purchase whats not to love?!additional notes:this spot has the lowest price and largest selections of hemp protein and c4 that ive found in town, and the only place that seems to stock cellucore hd consistently. if you need enough whey to last a small army through nuclear holocaust, stock up here. do not be intimidated to come here. yeah, im sure they get a lot of roidedup broscience types, but the staff are chill and helpful, and ive seen all types here from kooky old hippie ladies to wannabe fitness barbies whose perfect manicures have never seen a deadlift. plus i shop here, so you know their standards cant be too high. ;
nice  shop with friendly service, cool little lounge area and a fair selection of vaping equipment.
after 5 days they got me a new tire.  although not as fast as i would have liked they didnt have control over it because the tire was only in stock in california. i would have liked that the whole thing be handled differently but it got resolved and im content and happy to put it behind me. mo the service advisor is a stand up guy and i dont have anything bad to say about his work. he didnt have any say in the original situation. hopefully in future situations avondale dodge makes it right at the beginning instead of pulling teeth i spent a lot of my hard earned  with this dealership and trust them with my vehicle. also talked to a maureen on the phone who was extremely professional and helpful throughout the whole ordeal.
best beans ive had in a long time.  rice was also excellent. the barbacoa and carnitas tacos rocked!!!   one was better but im not sure which was which.  cantinas always have a great atmosphere and the location is great!!   enjoy.
man i wish margaritas werent so delicious and refreshing. when you walk into a place and the barkeep tells you they are the inventors of the original margarita, well you might as well stick a fork in me, cause i aint going nowhere anytime soon.in case youre wondering, the original margarita is a damn fine margarita.my barkeep was house, and he was just about as brilliant as his more famous medical namesake.i started with the mexican corn. mexican corn is a truly odd experience for a midwestern kid who was raised on cornonthecob. back home, the only way people cooked cornonthecob was in a pot of boiling water, a method which all but removes every bit of flavor from the corn its a wonder i wasnt culinarily scarred for life. forgive the tangent here, but if i could travel back in time, i would go back to my grade school self and introduce myself to mexican corn and then we would explode into nonexistence when we make contact in the congratulatory high five.needless to say, there is a reason the mexican corn is pretty much the only picture on the menu. no matter what else you try, you need to try the mexican corn.house picked two tacos for me and kept the margaritas flowing. i will honestly admit i cannot remember which tacos i got, but that may be due to houses master mixology skills. i can say, without a doubt, that they were two of the best i have ever had.the prices here are quite high, which is the sole reason for the missing star. im not completely saying the price point doesnt match the food and service quality, but the prices need to come down a little bit to be a 5 star joint, especially on the original margarita, which hits you at a whopping 10 a piece. but the good news, happy hour has the original margarita at half price. guess where youll be finding me from now on?
good mexican fast food and great original margaritas. i was very happy to see three vegetarian taco options! original margaritas are half price during happy hour. the boca park location has a goodsized patio with big tables for large groups. staff is attentive. will definitely go back.
shout out to house for being awesome! i liked that you could pick your own salsa, and the endless warm chips made our hour happy!
great place , asked to watch boxing,they very accomodating ,great food,good music and great atmosphere! will come back again!
i love the location and ambiance of this restaurant!  theres outside seating and when the weather is nice and its cool in the late evening this is the place to sit, eat and relax.  the food is not bad, its more americanize than mexican food  kinda reminds me of baja grills .
since learning about hussongs cantina while in ensenada, mx a month ago and visiting the original location opened in 1892 i have been a fan of this place as a bar establishment. finding out that there was another location mandala bay here in vegas was very exciting but driving through boca park and seeing hussongs in an old restaurant location i had previously visited i was more than excited!! walking up to hussongs there is a visible outside covered patio location with bar tops and a few 24 seating tables, patio is not super big and on this day when we arrived it was somewhat empty but filled very quickly. walking into the restaurant we were quickly greeted by a hostessserver that asked us if we had been here before. i said no only the one in mexico. she then proceeded to tell us how to order fooddrinks from the walk up counter and we would be given a table  flag, then we could sit anywhere we like and the fooddrinks would be brought out. tip: be sure to tell the staff when ordering you would like to keep your tap open if you want more drinks. we did not order food but certainly ordered the original margarita to see if it lived up to its standard in mexico! drinks were on happy hour special 36pm mf. as we sat on patio the drinks were quickly severed and they were certainly strong and tasty! not quite as strong as the mexico drinks, however, in there defense, that was mexico :the food looked good and will certainly be back to try that! there is a center bar located inside the restaurant along with a few tvs which has sports playing at the time. again, i am fan overall and happy this place is near by at boca park, next to pink berry and total wine and spirits.
love trying new places, heard this place had amazing mexican food... let me tell you it was delicious! the salsa bar and guacamole.... oh my... but the only thing that held me back from giving 5 stars was because of the bartender, our waitress was amazing but the bartender was helping too. she would hand out food from over the pony wall near the bar while the waitress was getting our order... or reach over the pony wall to get old dishes... it was the most oddest thing ive ever had happen at a restaurant.... other than that food was amazing even the margaritas!!
i hate to say it, but i like this place. some may be turned off the the overflareification of the interior or the highpriced mexican fare at least compared to holeinthewall spots. but, the tacos and street corn won me over. the char and prominent cotija flavor of the former make it worth getting, especially when its free for checking in. as for the tacos, the pork belly is my favorite. balanced sweet and savoriness, varied texture with the cabbage mix and most importantly it was topped with chicharrones. whats not to like? the barbacoa was a close runnerup. who cares if it was messy with its sauce dripping everywhere. its still bold flavored and delicious. less noteworthy, but still decent were the chicken tacos and carnitas. taco platters come with two tacos, which you can mixandmatch. rice and beans can be hit or miss. the first time around the rice was better than almost any rice ive tried at a mexican restaurant  light, fluffy and buttery. the second time around... not so much. still, hussongs is a worthy spot to hit up as long as you dont mind paying a little more for tacos.3.5 stars
the service was great! the bartender during happy hour was informative and attentive! while the food was good i wish it was more memorable, besides the burning sensation of spiciness in my tummy i actually dont remember what our  food really tasted like! we will probably come back to try something else and see if anything else would be more memorable!! i would say give it a try!!
i love a place w both omni  vegan options!  the vegan taco menu this is on a separate menu that you need to ask for is affordable 10.95 for two tacos, rice,  beans and has a slew of options.  i enjoyed both the fried avocado taco  fishless filet tacoo.  they even have a kids menu for those picky omni children.my sisterinlaw had the ceviche and thoroughly enjoyed it! restaurant is in a great location, w nice outdoor heated seating area, and service was attentive.
having dinner here on a monday night. where is everybody? food here is terrific, margaritas even better. the mexican street corn is delicious with char that was just right, while their tacos were great. had the two taco combo with ribeye and chicken tacodeliciosa!! great combination of flavors. and dont miss the chips we had two baskets with their excellent green chili salsa.
i like this place. the micheladas, elote, ceviche and stacked quesadilla are good. however the service could use some improvement, my husband and some friends ive brought here dont feel its worth coming back too. i am still willing to give it another go.
so this place is good but has room for improvement. pros: healthy properly portioned food such as beef, chicken, salmon, rice or veggie bowls. i got the salmon plate with brown rice. it also comes with salad with a miso style dressing and cantaloupe. everything tasted good. the food is a 5 out of 5. i love the variety of ice tea. i tried them all and they were really good. cons: so all the pictures show items on plates but they are served in plastic to go style containers. also you order at the bar and they call your name. my complaint here is i would rather have my meal on a plastic plate like panera and with 7 people working the building they could staff 1 person to deliver food just like smash burger and panera do. i know these are small gripes. the other thing is these are properly proportioned meals. do not go in expecting to stuff yourself. i think they are very fairly priced for what you and you will leave full just be aware before you go. i personally would do them for dinner because i like a heavier lunch with a lighter dinner vs small lunch big dinner. try them i think they will do well i think with a little tweaking they could be a 5 star casual dining joint.
the wifey and i were looking for something new, seen a post on fb for waba grill.......so we went ahead and tried it out, we really enjoyed the chicken bowel wifey and the half chicken half beef bowel for me. great flavor, tender chicken and beef......i got mine with brown rice snd veggies, just delicious. ......would come back to try the grilled salmon  over rice.
waba is a healthier ono hawaiin, but if you are looking to try out their chicken and steak, it is better to order them separately.  from a pricing standpoint it is cheaper to order separate than to mix them.  they give you plenty of rice, probably more than the meat itself.  aside from the side salad, you will have to order the veggies separate.
i enjoyed the salmon plate for lunch today. it was delicious!! my salmon was glazed in a light, sweet teriyaki sauce over a soft bed of rice. the fruit of the day was orange slices. they also give you a small side salad. i sat and drank a refreshing, ice cold coconut tea while i waiting for my food. they bring it out to your table for you. a healthy lunch option without sacrificing flavor! yummy!
small fast food, occupancy might be 60? pretty busy for a sunday. definitely fresh food and pleasant service. a little loud, im not sure if its the place is self echos or just everyone is loud? wasnt as impressed as the reviews, not saying it was bad just not as good as i anticipated  steak is just average flank steak really, my vegetables werent steamed enough, quite crunchy would i go again?  no
went here for dinner its really good and price is not bad at all. kinda reminds me of yogis grill. the miso soup however was not that good. but the steak and chicken was really good. my buddy had the  shrimp bowl he said nothing too special. over all for price its good and filling.
fast and healthy food. not many pleaces of this kind on the west valley.i ate the steak salad and my boyfriend the chicken rice and veggies bowl. the taste and the amount wete both very good. well definitely come back soon.
have you ever had samurai sams? well if you did and liked it it, then you would like waba. i like samurai sams 4 stars worth and since they are similar ill give waba a 4 also.  no further comments.  thank you
we split a 1 which is the chicken steak plate 730 calories.  i was impressed with the size of the serving and it was easy for me and my sweetie to split and be satisfied.  the cashier was super nice that helps
service was quick and the food options definitely felt healthier than something like mcdonalds. i found myself enjoying the sides more than the actual dish but overall i was happy with my purchase. the cashiers were more than happy to help in assisting me with my order or even how the menu works altogether
my daughter works next door and told us we should try it.  we all ordered and when the food came, it looked fantastic!  larger healthy portions.  except, i thought i had ordered the 1!  as my wife and daughter told me no, you said 8, i realized that i realized that i was stating the 8 price of the 1!  senior moment!  so i had just said what the hell, i love salmon when mercedes was walking by and overheard the whole exchange and offered to make me a 1. i thanked her and assured her that 1 it was my mistake and 2 i love salmon anyway and should probably be eating a salad anyways.  5 mins later she showed up with a small rice bowl of steak and chicken a mini 1 and said i want you to try it anyways!  have a great nigh!  great food and amazing customer service!!
went to this place with my family. my mom and dad are in their 80s. my daughter is in her 20s. we all enjoyed the food here.  it was friendly and clean. the food was good. we all enjoyed our experience here. i wouldnt bring a large group here though. you order at counter. so a big group might be a bit awkward.
welcome to the new second cup!craft coffee bar? pour over? steampunk? espresso?phone charging station?a barista that knows about coffee profile and can do a decent pourover? i just love the new concept.
i was staying right down the street from second cup cafe for a few days and it became my regular stop for my morning coffee. service was friendly and prices were reasonable. i do wish that they had the beverage list available on english as well, but overall i was satisfied every visit.
we found freiburg gastropub on yelp while visiting from chicago and stopped in for lunch on a beautiful saturday afternoon.first, the restaurant has just opened so we werent put off at all by some service glitches because everything turned out right in the end and we appreciate the difficulty of getting a new restaurant up and running. on the other hand, the bartender was friendly and very competently described each of the german beers on tap. she even offered a few small samples which i kindly repaid with a fullsize spaten and then a wonderful flight of three beers.now, the food. it ranged from good to really good but, in general id say three out of four stars.we started with the potato pancakes and koenigsberger klops meatballs. the pancakes couldve been a bit crisper but they were delightful and most filling. they were accompanied by a delightful sour cream and a flavorful topping of something that resembled apple pie filling but, dont get me wrong, was pretty good and a perfect accompaniment.the caper sauce on the meatballs was nice but rather bland. this may not have been a bad thing, though, because it let the magnificent flavor of the meatballs shine.  did i mention the flavor and texture of the meatballs was superb? another appetizer we tried were the bratstickers; pot stickers filled with a traditional bratwurst filling. interesting. i guess they couldve use a bit more filling to plump them up but theyre served with a perfect mustard and a small garnish of pickled onions or radish which was terrific, too. dont miss it.we added to this the cucumberdillsour cream salad which did not disappoint. it brought back memories of family picnics in kenosha when the same dish was served in large ceramic bowls after goodhearted german grandmas spent the afternoon picking cucumbers, slicing, and stirring.finally, i ordered the schweinbraten sandwich which looked more like pulled pork. at first i was disappointed at the appearance because it looked rather plain but at the first bite the flavor and juice exploded in my mouth. wunderbar!the draft beer selection is wonderful and i strongly suggest one of the flights, either three, six, or maybe even 10 4oz tastings.  i found two new favorites!be patient as the restaurant staff works out the bugs and i think youll be satisfied with this newest place to eat in the heart of monroe street which, if you dont know, is a wonderful district in madison on lake wingra and featuring almost all locally owned stores and restaurants.
the spicy horseradish mustard is awesome, great beers, and get the riesling chicken with asparagus and spaetzel!!!!! you wont regret it!!!!
i had the trout, which was very nice.  my wife had the kohlrouladen.  it was a bit soggy and had too much butter.  the potato pancakes were great and and the beer selection is phenomenal.  the pretzel and bread was ok, but it would be great to have some real german rye bread.  also, it would be nice to have some entreesized salad options.
stopped here for lunch today and it was so great i have already planned dinner back here with my husband!  first, the service was great!  sam was knowledgeable, friendly, and timely particularly important on a lunch hour, but i know if it was dinner he would have kept my beer full!  we ordered their lunch special which was a wiener schnitzel sandwich with red cabbage slaw as well as their rinderbraten.  both were phenomenal!  i ordered the gurkensalat cucumber, dill, mustard salad instead of potatoes and it was perfect with the meat laden sandwich.  the interiors are great...not too dark like some german gastropubs but still full of character.  their tap list was insane!  before i even tasted food i had texted my husband a photo of the list and told him we had to come back!  weinstephaner, paulaner, and spaten all on tap....yes please!  there isnt any outdoor seating but well worth the venture inside...great job freiburg!
took our german friend who is from dusseldorf area and he gives the restaurant 4 stars. wide variety of german beers you do not normally get in us. he said the mustard and food is authentic and good variety of dishes from across germany.
our second visit in a week, its that good!  stopped in last evening and am wishing we hadnt split an entree since i would love to have those leftovers tonight!  same waitress on both visits, karen?, so not sure whether its a fluke or if all servers are trained impeccably but compliments on the service and spot on recommendations.  confusing menu since its a cuisine im not knowledgeable in but she offered a lot of assistance in selecting beer and dishes.  beautiful interior and an all around great experience from start to finish, a welcome addition to monroe street!
great german food and beer.  pretzels and mustard are great.
went with my mama j, i had the shredded pork with slaw and potatoes and she had the brat stickers. first the decor is fun, am i in germany? no just a place that looks like a german restaurant on monroe street, okay thats fine. my meal was delicious, the potatoes are amazing, crispy on the outside and just the right softness in the middle. the pork sammy was great, my only beef he he was that the bun was too big and got in the way of the great flavors. mama j had the brat stickers, the mustard was too strong for her, but i loved them. i love mustard, i just eat it right out of the jar. so we went there about 12:45 on a friday, service was fast and our waiter really knew the menu and restaurant. great experience! i cant wait to go back and try something else, the menu is heavy but its german...i mean weve all seen oootter on the simpsons.
excellent food and great service. ill be back and i recommend you check it out if youre looking for good german beer and food.
relatives took us to freiberg gastropub in madison wi.  parking is hard to find in the neighborhood, but it turns out that a local office has spaces after 6.  if you want really good german cuisine, definitely go to frieberg.  we shared 2 appetizers, pork cheeks and the wurst platter.  the weiswurst is particularly good, but all 4 of us enjoyed both.  each chose a different entree, and all four were very good.  of the 4, the trout specialfriday night was greatthe fish covered the plate and the potato pancakes side dish was really tasty.  the pork shank had great crackling on the skin and was very flavorful.  the wait staff is knowledgeable on all the dishes and gave good advice on beer and wine pairings.  service was professional and attentive.  the only reason this doesnt rate five stars, in my book, is the noise level.  with a full crowd it was hard to carry on a conversation.  if management could place some noiseabsorbing wall hangings this would earn the next star.
overall a great restaurant. we cannot wait to go back and try more dishes!great ambiance. our party of 8 fit well at one of their normal tables. service was great. our server barb? was knowledgeable about the menu and had some great suggestions for us. food was highquality and excellent, though the maultaschen had a very too? rich flavor. huhn chicken and wiener schnitzel were excellent. great beer selection.
