this restaurant is very new. as a matter of fact i believe they opened two days ago. with that in mind i know its a little early to be criticizing this restaurant.  when we got to the restaurant two girls battled over how to seat us. once we were seated we waited. we then continued to wait. we waited some more. my wife and i actually played a game where we would see how many waiters or waitresses would either pass by or look at us directly.  after about 10 minutes of just sitting there i told my wife if one more waiter walks by us we would leave. my wife was extremely embarrassed at this, but i had to put my foot down. shortly after two waiters walked right past us as they talked to each other. we got up to walk out. as we walked out of the restaurant we both laughed. not only did nobody notice we were leaving, but the greeter who had just seated us actually said thank you have a nice day. i know that this restaurant is fairly new so i wont talk about the food or drink. oh yeah, we never got to that point. not sure if we would ever go back to this place. its just a weird situation to be honest. doesnt the restaurant want to serve food and drink to its customers? apparently not for public school 702.
terrible. just checked out this place for the first time and i may never go back. our waiter was very very nice but i waited 10 minutes before i was asked if i needed a menu. after 5 different servers came by my table i realized the management wasnt in order. my fiance ordered a mojito which took 21 minutes to arrive. they were also out of three of beers i tried to order.great idea at this place but definitely need to figure out how to run a team of servers. maybe maybe will try in a couple months after they work out the kinks.
hhhhhhoooorible! walked out! first of all, i called to get their address and the receptionist huffed and puffed  at me because, she didnt know the zip code or the street address. the wait was 45 min and there was a long line of people. so i thought, ok,status quo its a new restaurant but, most of employees are temporary transplants from other public school restaurants. i manage to get a crush velvet  a bourbon of some sort at the bar from the bar manager as the bar is inhabited by couch potatoes nursing their draft beers. i noticed several group of people leave the line and i am now close enough to see there are empty booths in the bar section, empty tables, empty communal tables large enough to seat a party of 5,  we are 2. i walk up to the menu management gal at the podium and asked if we could sit at the communal tables and i was told, you need a reservation to be seated. i think to myself, i need a reservation to sit in the bar at a communal table? why? i quickly scan the dining room on the other side and there are serval tablesbesides the booths  tables in the bar that are empty!i i say to the menu management gal,  i need a reservation to sit in the bar? since when? other public school restaurants allow walk up sit down at the communal tables. doesnt that defeat the concept of communal? the best part was when a gal, ill just call her in charge asked if id like to  sit out side...... ....in 110 degree heat?  really? now why would she offer outside when there are several available tables in every section of that huge  restaurant. if this new restaurant is trying to create the allure of something out of the velvet rope days of studio 54 they are missing the mark! you are located in a brand new mall with many trendy restaurants. people can easily go elsewhere and will......and i did.  grade: fail!
i am so pissed that i wasted my motherfathers day at this place when i was so excited about coming here all week. so me and my girlfriends party of 4 sat in the bar in a sharing large table in the middle of the bar. we sat down and waited 10 min for anyone to greet us. finally a girl name valarie came to greet us with no menus with her. so we waited another 5 min to get them. you can tell that she was very flustered and couldnt maintain multiple  tables. finally get the menus and she walks away...we dont know anything about the menus or drink specials for lunch! lets do the math...we have been here almost 20 min and we have nothing to drink or water! it takes her forever to come and take a drink order that was horrible.....we asked questions and she never got into detail just answered quickly cuz you can tell she had no time to help us with our decisions. she takes my drink order and walks away and never takes any of my other guest drink order. wtf????? it took another 10 min to get 1 freaken mimosa....i look around and i see people are pissed and getting no service. during this time valarie is taking new tables and forgets almost every step that you need to do. she comes back with water finally!!!! she comes back to take our food order and i said how about taking my friends drink order first before you walk away she laughs and says ok what can i get for youi wanted to walk out but i saw some cool food items and i was starving and 10 bottomless mimosa i thought it was a great deal! so she takes a drink order for everyone and waited another 10 min just to get them......im so freaken frustrated at this point....im am realizing that out food order is going to take even longer. so i flag down a server to help us and that it would be nice to get us another server that knows what they are doing. bloody mary was super spicy, like they put a whole thing of pepper and tabasco. we put it to the side and never drank it. the rest of the girls had water since it was the quickest thing to quench our thirst. finally ordered food! tots, smothered burrito, fried califlower, speck  eggs, mac  chz , ahi tacos.......the only thing that was good because they were cold items were speck  eggs and ahi tacos. the tots looked like charcoal with sauce on the side.....wtf? the funny thing is someone actually put this on the table???? smothered burrito was so hard my friend could barley cut through the tortilla....the eggs tasted rotten.....it was horrible. anything that was served hot was disgusting. mac  chz was dry and the chorizo was like rocks.....we spoke to a manager and he replaced 2 items the burrito and tots. during this time i had asked for another bottomless mimosa over 15 min as my glass was empty glass where are so small its so stupid. during this time there was a couple having brunch for fathers day and they had there burger made 4 times! this guy was so pissed instead they gave him a nutella ice cream dessert....???? are u serious! as there was a food critic right behind them and ordered a salad and took 2 bites and left. the energy surrounding us was so weird and off.  during this whole time valarie came by maybe 2 times and said is everything ok? we just said yes because we were so upset how things were going that we just wanted to speak to a manager. we told him what was going on and he said he was so sorry and he would take care of the bill. his name was nick...he seemed not authentic with his apology. there was no deep apology other than he was sorry and he would take care of it. maybe because he was going to every table around us hearing the same story.....give this place 2 months to fire and rehire a solid staff that can handle a fast pace restaurant and hopefully they can hire people that are passionate about there brand! wack!
the place is super cool inside and the outdoor patio is going to rock once its cool enough to sit out there. but this place has much to be desired. i love to go to happy hour and have drinks and then order food towards the end. we did not even order food because the service was so dang slow that getting a drink was near to impossible. the female bartender at the bar, courtney, told me she was going to charge my bill. she did, and she never gave us the drinks we were charged for. the people on my right ordered an appetizer and they were incorrectly charged  they were charged higher than the pricing on the menu. when they said something to courtney she said oh the menu prices have changed.  so shouldnt that mean that the menu prices on the menu should have changed? the person on the left ordered something off the menu and courtney said, we dont have that anymore. didnt they just open? so how could you have something on the menu that they no longer even serve? how could there be three different sets of people sitting at the bar all given wrong prices and wrong orders!?. happy hour beers are small. i cant comment on the food since we never ordered it because we knew it would take too long to get it. we went somewhere else to eat.  this place is never going to make it if they dont get their stuff together.
thought it was a soft opening with how bad they didnt have there stuff together. server totally left us after taking our drink order and didnt return for 30 mins later we received a messed up margarita than took another 16 mins to get correct drink. finally getting our food we had no utensils, napkins, or plates for the pizza. the only good thing was the food.
very bad service and the djs that they had were a joke .... blasting music then quiet then blasting.... then sound checks an hour into the set!! ha ha ha ha.   place is empty on the 4th of july..... cpk was packed !! if you want to try it come fast ... this one wont last long !!!
this is one of the worst places i have been to in a long time.  food was not cooked properly and very poor service.  we had several people in our party and two ordered hamburgers.  one well, the other med. well.  both came out red inside, basically rare to medium rare.  i sent mine back after the server said it would only take 3 minutes to fix it.  12 minute later mine comes back after everyone else is done with their meal. youve all had that happen where it really disrupts the vib.  when it finally showed up, the side salad was wilted and warm, like it had been sitting under a heat lamp or in the microwave.  i sent it back and let them keep it and ate what was left of my wifes salad which had way too much dressing on it.  the other person at his rare burger and got sick later so maybe i should feel lucky.  i spoke to the manager but it was some young guy and he just smiled while i was talking as if he thought it was funny.  i even asked him why he was smiling and he said i am just a happy guy so at the end of the day, they dont even care.  they are a new place now and crowded, but if they dont learn how to cook or fix an incorrect order 702 will be seeing fewer and fewer people drop by.  beware.
i have been twice and both times i had terrible service. the first time i went in for happy hour with a group of 5. after the server took our order we never saw him again until we had to flag him down for the check. in addition to our nonexistent waiter, we didnt receive our drinks until we had already received the check. i decided to give them a second chance and went in last night for industry night at around 9 oclock. we sat in the bar area and i had high hopes because they were not busy. i saw at least 3 waiters walk past our table with no acknowledgement towards us. after waiting 20 minutes with no one coming by to take our order we left. we decided to go to the yard house where the bartenders are friendly and the service is great! i will not return to public school 702.
fun decor but very loud.  buffalo cauliflower good but salmonover cooked and dry served on not fresh vegetables. will not go again.
i think someone forgot to tell the people behind the bar that there are hundreds of great bartenders in vegas looking for jobs. these people are very rude with no smile. artisan beer really? served with horrible food? i can get better beer and food just walking out of that place. with wonderful food drink and service all around them they are due to fail. go ahead try and pay that large rent with you poor service and food.
they messed up my order after i repeated it several times. i said no bacon but they still brought out bacon and giving them the benefit of the doubt i started eating only to realize the bacon on my burger. i am not going back
we had high hopes for this place... great concept but horrible horrible service! over and over and over again we tried this place and every time awful service! who has 8 bartenders behind the bar and 6 people at the bar and no one can get a drink? while one of the bartenders drinks a redbull, people wait to be helped. so we try again and sit outside at a table, once again no one would acknowledge us for not exaggerating almost an hour. no one would ask us if we needed a drink or food. servers walk by over and over again. this place is a joke! horrible! horrible! horrible service! an amazing concept... great outdoor seating, great setup, this place honestly has a lot of potential.... but management needs to fire their whole staff and try again!!!! sadly a disappointment.
7 of us sat on the patio from 9:01 pm to 9:45 pm and were visited by a server zero times. once we realized we were not going to get any service, we went to the bar and when 1 of us asked for a water  the bartender rolled their eyes at us.  this was after we ordered 6 cocktailsbeers from them. very doubtful i will return.
i have to say im very disappointed by the service we received here today. we came for dinner and after we were seated we waited 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were there. several servers and staff including the hostess that sat us walked by without saying a word. so when our server, carissa did come over we told her we had been waiting for 15 minutes and she gave us attitude and just said ok, there was confusion with the tables. and she wasnt very nice about it either. we placed our order and it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. our food came fairly quick and im sad to say it was not worth the wait. i had the seared scallop salad and it was very bland. i would have asked for more dressing but carissa was no where to be found. the entire time we were there she checked on us once, she was not pleasant at all or even smiled. such a shame because the atmosphere of the restaurant is fun, cute decor, and quite a fun bar menu, but i dont feel we will be back due to the horrible service we received. with so many restaurants in downtown summerlin i would rather go someplace where they at least act like they want our business and are not rude to us.
if i could go lower i would... went to the bar and the bartender was rude and acted like he did us a favor... all the staff acted above all the patrons.. over this place!!
horrible horrible horrible service. in this industry it does not matter how amazing the quality of the products are if it is not partnered with customer service. the entire experience was ridiculous. from the moment we walked in cold stoic hosts to neglectful servers. i forgot about the food and drinks because i felt like an interruption rather than a paying guest in their establishment. the atmosphere was very dull and pretentious. it could have been leaps and bounds better but im never returning and will never recommend this establishment. management needs to think about its hiring process and establish better standards of guest service. maybe then they could educate their target audience about food and beer. i give this a couple of years tops. this place greatly reminds me of rattlecan that used to be at the venetian, great concept and great products but cold and unwelcoming staff and atmosphere. an epic fail and a waste of invenstors money.
this place is a joke! tried to reserve a table for a bday party for me and my co workers back in june but the manager nick was being an asshole and never returned my call after calling his cell and calling the restaurant several times and leaving a message with his staff to confirm reservations since it was for a party of 10. this went on for like 2 days of me calling them and them not answering any of my messages. finally i got fed up and emailed their corporate office and voila the next day nick emails his apology and is now able to accomodate our party but of course i already made reservations to another place at lazy dog which literally just took me 2 mins. over the phone to do. so this review is for the service that i never got and not for the food or drinks as i never got the chance to try em.
i have tried this restuarant now 4 times and each time it loses a star but tonight was my final visit..1the inside is so loud it is hard to carry on a conversation so we love to sit outside, but tonight they had a very loud dj which made the inside seem quiet.  they also kept sounding off a loud horn which was quite annoying.  the ambiance does not reflect the restuarants name; public school, it seems more like a loud bar with a sub par disconnected menu.2 we ordered salmon with  vegetables and steak salad...the salmon was delicious, but the vegetables tasted like dish soap and the lettuce served with the 4 pieces of thinly sliced steak looked and tasted like day old bag lettuce...a little salt and pepper would have been nice to enhance some flavor, but our server never returned until we were done with our meal.3 we ordered 3 glasses of wine, 1 califlower appetizer, 1 steak salad, and 1 salmon with vegetables..approximately 95.00.  they did take 11.00 off for the dish soap veggies, but the service was challenging and for paying almost 100.00 it was very disappointing.  its so unfortunate since it is a great location.
very nice atmosphere,  my dish disappointment.  i had the chicken and waffles. very mushy and soggy not what you normally would expect. took one bite and asked for something else...fish and chips light fluffy and good. the upside the deep fried cauliflower appetizer very very good....drinks good too.
went to this place sunday it was not very full but we had to wait long for drinks!  ordered our meals and they were all bad.  the pasta was undercooked, hard and tasted like starch, the chicken in my kale salad was full of gristle and my husbands short ribs were all fatty!!!  he said it was mor like a pot roast.  unreal!  the manager came over said she was sorry and we reordered different items!  the pizzas was good the salmon too much butter just too rich; my husband did not eat.  we will not go back again. we also knew people sitting across from us and they also sent their entire meals back, all 4 of them!  they need new cooks or something!
i love this place! the concept is so welcoming and relaxed. im here regularly, almost twice a week. the food is spot on, the cocktail and brew choices are beyond expectation. the experiences have been stellar with an awesome gregarious, engaging crew up until tonight. all it takes is one egregious experience to ruin it all. never, and i emphatically stress never get served by the bartender lisa. im an industry professional so ive experienced both sides of the bar. i know everyone is entitled to a bad day but, this one shes special.walk up to the bar, have a seat and have this bartender directly in front of you for a solid two minutes and see if she even acknowledges your existence. where i sat was at the ice and the mixing station so she was 22inches away from me. it took the bar back to approach  me and asked if i wanted the menu. finally,  grumpy looked at me and asked if i wanted to place an order. my reply, would you please fire up a brick chicken. she looked at me like i was an alien the outer space kind. she looked so puzzled, i repeated the order by saying, the jidori brick chicken? and pointing to the menu. you know what her response was? you know when someone has that look that they cant be bothered. it was that, with this reply, are you getting a drink?! i was speachless because, last i checked, id rather get tipped for a 25 dinner than an 8 beer. she looked absolutely perturbed as if how dare me order food before a cocktail. im most likely going to retract this review after a few months just to make sure this establishment stays in check and not to cocky with their success. i wanted to twist the knife just a tad. i tipped my server when i moved to a table 55. :
on my second visit to the location, we came for lunch. my husband and i were seated and sit there 10 min with no one coming to greet us or even take our drink order.  wait staff passed us but not one stopped by. when the booth next to us was seated and quickly served their drinks  after we were there 10 min no one noticed us with nothing. we left and told the hostess we were leaving due to poor service  she did nothing to help save the situation or save us as customers. i called a few minutes later to let the manager know our disappointment  he was very apologetic on the phone took my name and number and asked me if he could call and talk about this later as he wanted to know more specifics  he never called its been a month. i understand why we had bad service  bad management!!
horrible food. horrible service. server was rude and had a bad attitude. the place doesnt even have ranch...... what kind of restaurant doesnt have ranch ? we had a big group and got a lot of different food and appetizers and everything was disgusting. ordered kids meal pasta for my daughter and the pasta was still hard. would never ever recommend this place. never ever coming back again. if i could i wouldnt give this place any stars.
initially i was impressed with the modern decor sadly that is where it stopped. i have made reservations through yelp and there was some sort of corporate issue with the website and i had no reservation even though i had received a confirmation. i had brought guests from out of town to try the new restaurant out expecting it to be amazing. everyone disliked their food. including myself. it was bland tasting and  not worth the trip out to downtown summerlin.  perhaps an unrefined to pallet would find this delicious.
i tried this place 3 times and i dont know how they are going to make it.  its a limited menu and mostly kale based.  the service is not great if you want to eat with your hands sit on the patio.  now maybe its different if you are going here to drink and hang out....
the concept and restaurants of downtown summerlin have good intentions. unfortunately, like every other restaurant ive tried in dts, public school is a bust. my friends and i arrived at 9pm on a thursday. we walk in and two people are talking at the doorway. oh wait, theyre not just two people who are hanging out lounging on the doorway with horrible posture, they work here apparently despite their nonchalance toward any potential customers. we were seated in a huge booth for the 3 of us that was unbussed with crumbs and sticky crap all over. lovely. when asking for directions to the restrooms, same rude service. so we get our table cleaned, find the bathroom, and eventually order some very mediocre food. fried cauliflower is not amazing like everyone describes. its exactly what it sounds like. its just fried cauliflower for 9 or something. i think their markup on this is 999981625536 as a head of cauliflower is .89 at the store.we ordered the chicken  waffles that everyone raved of and was shown on our menu. we were given tandoori brick chicken instead? i guess our waitress didnt hear us, but the mystery gets thicker... apparently chicken  waffles is no longer on the menu, despite what we saw infront of our eyes! so the host who was lounging at the door is handing out old menus and the server who assumed we said one thing didnt ask again to clarify. so when she brings out the wrong item, she said is that okay? do you want to keep it? ha!!! if someone ordered chicken and waffles, do you think tandoori brick chicken with middle eastern spices will fill that craving? no. of course we dont want the brick chief and want chicken and waffles which despite being off the menu, they made for us? so we finally get the chicken and waffles. waffles were good hitting every one of my taste buds  sweet, savory, luscious, crispy. the chicken was disgusting. they were fried chicken tenders, but the tenders were huge and cut poorly. think about a 3 inch chicken tender... the only good thing we ate was the kale caesar salad which i would order again if someone dragged me to public school 702. if i wasnt bound and dragged, you would never find me here again. my review is confusing, but so was our experience. everything about the night contradicted another. hosts, servers, and chefs had no idea what was going on and were not working as a team. the restaurant has been open long enough to fix these issues so there are no excuses for our disappointing night.
terrible service.  i was told it would be an hour to eat outside and 20 minute for the inside.  there were many tables in both places. so i asked the hostess what the problem was,  she said they were short in the kitchen.  we went somewhere else.
after my previous review where i walked out, i received an email from their corp office wanting to talk about the experience. i gave them my email address and never heard from them. again proves my point  bad management.
while it has a lot of selections, most of it is obviously frozen and reheated in a microwave. its trying desperately to be a restaurant, but its not at all and just had really bad bar food with a twist of frozen crap. perfect if you want to get really drunk and eat frozen chicken wings and fries, but if youre looking for good food, not the place to go.
went here  on a thursday  afternoon to have a couple of drinks and appetizers with friends after playing golf. came in around 4 pm. my brother in law ordered a jack and coke , the waiter told him they were out of coke. the waiter didnt offer any solution to being out of coke until my brother in law asked if they had diet coke. the manager came over and just made the situation worse. the manager gave us a 30.00 credit off the bill which we did not ask for. we payed the bill only having the one drink. went around the corner to lazy dog and had a great time and great service! and yes they had plenty of coke! this was not the first time something was not right here but it will be the last time we go back.
this place is not great, at all. busy, but i dont get why it is. service sucks, food sucks. the bathroom was the messiest bathroom i have ever seen at any restaurant. trash all over the place, napkins from the restaurant on the floor, no soap. i wont be going back.
if i could give this place a zero i would. we left before we even got sat do to the horrible looks from the waitstaff, manager and hostess. when we arrived after the holiday parade we were told a 15 minute wait for table for 3.  well 30 min later and seeing 6 other parties being sat before us, getting dirty looks from the wait staff, a hostess glaring at my kids and never speaking to us during the wait, a manager obviously seeing us just wait there and not even acknowledging us with a hi, we just left. i will spend my money with  other restaurants in summerlin who have amazing customer service. this place just left a bad taste in my mouth. felt so uncomfortable there. was really looking forward to the place too . oh well!!!!
i have been to this restaurant few times and the last night experience was horrible! to start with, there were two host persons at the door, a girl and a boy, 11212015 around 6:30pm. we entered and had to stand behind them for like 2 minutes because the they were seem to be having their own conversations! as a valued customer to the restaurant should i disturb their little private conversations?? no!!! finally the girl acknowledged that we are standing behind them and she said there is a wait for 25 minutes! and guess what?? we could see from where we are standing that there are so many seats available at the bar, where they fully serve all the menu items!!! and she didnt even bother to suggest that!!! wow!! felt like she think we dont want to be too busy!!!  and since we know we can sit at the bar, we went there and sat. i ordered two appetizers, two entrees and two cocktails as usual! my pasta was cold, but i sent back to warm it up. during this time someone took away all the utensils assuming that i am done eating, therefore i had to wait another few minutes get new utensils again! and we wish they didnt put too much bbq sauce on the bison burger! very disappointed really!!!
update: im sad so say that i was extremely underwhelmed. not by the quality of the food but the quality of the customer service. i have been here multiple times with my boyfriend and decided to bring my best friend here to try it. first, the hostess. she was opening the door for some middle aged women ahead of us. she continued to hold the door for my party of three but then stated, how can i help you?. i really wanted to respond with well, this is a restaurant soooooo..... but i decided not to and told her how many where in our party. she then said she had to help the people ahead and would be with us in a minute. when it was our turn she asked if we wanted to bar or dining area. i chose bar because i knew it was going to be the tail end of happy hour and we would be able to throw our order in quick before it was over. the hostess said sure, go on ahead. so i say myself. i honestly couldnt tell you if she actually walked behind us or how the menus got on the table. i just know i turned around and menus were there but the hostess was gone. we never received the usual your server will be with you in a minute. this is where the next thing comes in. second, the server. i have family that is servers and they immediately greet people that come to their table within 1 minute. i had sat at the table, my boyfriend went to the bathroom and returned and i still sat there and waited. it got to the point where i was actually looking around wondering when i was going to see who the server was. kaila finally came to the table with waters, never said her name. just asked if we wanted anything to drink or appetizers and if we had been there before. i told her two of us had and it was my friends first time. i asked her if they still had happy hour going on and she said no, its 3:30 to 6:30 and then asked my friend what time it was. my friend looked at her phone and went its 6:30 on the dot. and kaila went oh yeah you missed it. i can honestly say this was the first time i had been somewhere where it was close to happy hour and the server didnt offer to hurry and rush the order in so that we would still get the happy hour specials. not to mention the fact that if we hadnt been waiting for our server to greet us, we would have made it in time for happy hour. we all ordered our drinks and as i was going to order appetizer she walked away. when she returned with our beers. she had poured my boyfriends but gave me the bottle of delirium and an empty glass and said in case you want a glass. i know that may seem minor but usually servers ask if you want in poured in a glass and this was the very first time i had ever not had delirium poured in a glass and served in a bottle. im not fancy or stuck up, but come on. next we ordered our appetizers. we got three different items and no plates. we literally sat there for 5 minutes waiting for plates. after maybe 15 minutes the kaila came over and asked if we wanted anything else or not. i told here we were going to get some entrees in a bit. she said okay and left. she came later and took our dinner orders and seemed more pleasant. im fairly certain it was only because she saw me checking in on yelp. we were so disappointed with the service that we dont think we will be back. which is disappointing, we really liked it. im not sure if because we were dressed casual and not all dolled up like the summerlin housewives of hipsters out on dates they thought we were cheap or what. but we all make a very good living and have family that are servers so we always tip 20, if not more and were repeat customers. but sadly i think thats changed.
worst experience in dining i have ever had. ive been here one time before and was reluctant to try another dish a friend of mine had. from first experience the food isnt as great and the price does not fit the quality for most dishes. however the truffled steak and macaroni was a big hit to me and felt that, that was the only reason to come. the server at the time was a big sweetheart and was another reason why i wanted to share this restaurant with personal friends and family.well today was my mothers birthday. knowing that their steak was great i was excited to bring her in for a try since shes already tried several yummy steakhouses fogo de chao just below plus and overall presentation of the restaurant is extremely creative! which is the only reason why i would give this place a star. i proceed in, and a woman with red hair who kind of reminded me of ronald mcdonald quickly frowns from her fake smile once we turn in. ultimately i ignored it and didnt care to let one gesture ruin our night. i proceed to say 2 for balcony please. she leads us in right away and offers us any seat in the house and will aware the servers that we are here.10 minutes later, not one server came. at this point i was losing patience. several server goes by and not one acknowledges us. i had enough time to have a conversation to reserve a dinner at fogo de chau and ultimately ashamed that i brought my mother in here. being the sweet woman she was, she agreed that we should just leave. not only did this place ruin a birthday dinner but was rude in every single way. will not becoming here any longer. on side note: maybe if she apologized when she clearly saw us leaving, i might have reconsidered the whole situation but she instead rudely smirked as we left.
soft opening . limited menu. only one kind of poke.ordered ahi belly, meat jun and 14 pound of poke to try. i have been to the name sake kuhuku superette. i lived in kahuku before moving to las vegas.the owner said she only would sell poke by the 12 pound. told her she could keep it. poke express is down the road. brought the food home. same sauce used for poke was used as marinade for belly.  it was over cooked also came with one scoop of rice and bland macaroni salad, kim chee, and pickled radish 13.95.meat jun fell apart. breading was just falling off same composed dish as ahi. 9.95. too little food for the money. never saw any sign to make aware of the minimum purchase of poke. stupid to begin with. there is no try before you buy on that either. i got so many other places to go. dont believe ill ever come back here. i tried to talk to the owner, but she was adamant its her restaurant.  i agree ...its your restaurant and its my money, ill take my money else where. i said this before i will say it again. great customer service will always make up for food short comings. this place lacks both.
i had different experience! my husband got me a fish plate. marinated with soy sauce.. it was extremely salty and smell bad too. went to trash right away.
way overpriced and small short portions...its not even this expensive in hawaii!no specials and 15 for a three item combo plate of bland food.l and l is better and its nothing special!they need to lower their prices, increase the portions and improve the quality if they want to survive.
came in with my family around 12 expecting to buy poke and was told that they did not have any poke available at the moment. 10 minutes later, someone else was able to order poke. i ordered 35 chicken katsu  meat chun bento. chicken katsu was alright but the sauce wasnt the best tasted very gingery  the meat chun had no flavor to it  was very very dry. my dad ordered the roast pork  lau lau combo roast pork good  fatty. the fried noodles were very dry and had absolutely no taste to it. the teri beef also had no taste to it  the spicy pork wasnt even spicy. they also served me spoiled kim chee and when i told them about it, they didnt offer to refund me. rating it 1 star because the portion size was the only good thing about the place
drove by and came in for lunch for some poke. was told that they are out of poke. seems to be a regular occurrence. prices on higher side compared to competition.
thought i would give this place a second chance and it was disappointing to say the least. i had meat jun and kalbi. the meat jun was soggy and flavorless like it was yesterdays leftovers and the kalbi was chewy undercooked and salty.to top it off they give you very small portions for a high price. it was 18! its not even that expensive at the ala moana food court in honolulu!do yourself a favor and scratch this place off the list! i wont be going back again.
bad customer service. i ordered a garlic shrimp plate and got more of an over cooked lemon peppered shrimp. being from hawaii and growing up eating kahuku garlic shrimp i expected it to have been almost as good, i mean this is kahuku poke and it says worlds famous. this is far from it. i went up to the cashier and told her my shrimp was over cooked the shrimp was half white and hard so i asked if the cook could make me a new batch and they said she could try cook it medium but it would be a bit raw. at this point i was over it and ordered a fried noodle plate paying for another meal because i was not satisfied. they didnt even offer me a discounted meal or further help so this was such a bad experience. never again!!!!
i highly advise everybody wait, to eat here. they just opened yesterday and i had horrible service when i came to dine today. waitress was not familiar with any of hooters menu to include drinks. hooters didnt have any drink menus. waitress told me they were getting them on friday food took way too long and instead of the waitress inquiring about my order she was taking selfies with all her friends. drinks came in a plastic cup. i was told they only took cash after i had sat down and ordered and had my drink. and was directed to an atm to get cash that charged me 6 dollars...not a very good experience.
waited 7 minutes and still wasnt acknowledged. no hostess, sat myself. no togo area either. the girls were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. this place is too new and they dont seem to know what theyre doing. and another thing part of the restaurant opens up to the pool so an oven effect is going on as you come in from the cooled casino into the now hot restaurant.
i guess you have to be a single dude or a group of guys to get great service from these waitresses! thank you manager chris for making this experience right!
great location, clean and drinks are within 10 min. do not order food!!! it takes an hour to get a simple burger or chicken wings. waste of time in vegas.unless you want drinks from tight dressed chicks, then avoid at all terms.
my friend and i came here last night for some good wings. ive been to other hooters locations before. we saw 3 other parties seated after us and served water and drinks. we flagged down our would be waitress and she said shed help us but still tended to the other parties first. we waited at least 15 minutes with no water or menus and walked out. the hostess said shed get a manager but we were just over it. i gave this review 1 star because i had to but we didnt even get water so...maybe it was because we had no guys in our party. what can i say...
although the service was good, as it usually is, the food was terrible. their quality has taken an incredibly sharp nose dive. and the atmoshere at the palms casino is reminiscent of eating lunch in a chemistry lab. its a real shame, ive been eating at hooters for nearly 30 years but i think im done now. i had my whole family with me and they all agree. it just lacked the rustic flare of the originals.
i would give no stars if that was an option. it seems not many people are happy about the quality of food and others are upset about how long it took to get the food. i wish i was so lucky. the hostesses were busy talking and playing on their phones to acknowledge us the moment we walked up. we were seated and after we put our menus down to indicate we were ready to order we waited an additional 10 mins for our waitress. we watched as waitresses went and chatted up tables, cleaned tables around us, and chit chatted with eachother before we gave up and went to the food court! i have literally given up on hooters as a dining establishment!
well pretty disappointed with the bloody marys here! was looking forward to a nice hangover cure but it wasnt happening.
fried chicken  wings is too oily, burger with bacon is good. staff needs more training. how to talk to a customer. when asked for our  check. just say who is you server 3 time in a rude manner. absolutely not coming  back to this place.
it wouldnt let me give 0 stars! we waited nearly 2 hours and for no food! we were pacified by the server with chips and dip but no food ever came. when we asked to speak to a manager he came  the owner came over and said he would take care of everything at the table. only problem is there is nothing but soft drinks and the comp chips and dips already. a few minutes later the owner tell the waitress to stop the order to that table all together. i cant even tell the story all the way, but it was horrible! the whole experience and we never got our food so cant tell you if its good.
worst service ever! first i tried to call in a to go order for just 10pc chicken. they put me on hold for over 15min! so i figured they were busy on a sunday night. i ended up just driving there and order my carry out when i get to hooters. when i got there, the restaurant was empty! the waiters were just standing around talking and one was playing a crossword puzzle. i ordered my 10pc and waited for 30min! never again will i go to this hooters ever again! lazy people are working here!
iam a regular at this new location and will no longer be eating here again. gabby the cashier so rudley greated me and got my order wrong after calling me retarded i have a service dog she might not have seen, so you can see how offended iam by this. too bad because this was actually my favorite place.
i have never dealt with anyone in my life like gabby , she is literally the worst cashier i have ever dealt with i went to ring my card up which is an american express and the chip did not work so then she told me she could not slide the card whether i asked her how another card would be use she could not answer then when i finally did pay for my food she use another card to slide and i asked her why she could not have just done that in the first place she was very rude to me and offered no consolation afterwards this is the place we have gone to several times and i will never be going to again
i always get bad service here, but the food is great. every time i go, the cashier forgets to give me a fork or the extra teriyaki sauce i ask for. it never fails.  they dont listen when i take my order  leave stuff out.
probably one of the worst customer service experiences ive ever had. i spoke with a man by the name of nathan helbig after ordering 4 sets of blinds and explaining that 3 of the sets came damaged and were poorly manufactured. he asked me to email him pictures and he would respond and let me know what would happen after reviewing them. a week goes by, no answer. i call them back up and speak with a man by the name of jeremy scandrick i let him know about my conversation with nathan and he tells me to send him the pictures so he can take care of it, a week later still no answer. tomorrow i dispute the charge and they can retrieve these blinds out of my garbage.
getting our blinds right has been a nightmare with selectblinds.com poor customer service, poor listening skills, no sense of empathy, and little desire to actually solve problems. i followed their measurement instructions exactly and the shears i bought are not even useful as the company doesnt provide proper instructions  when i challenged them on their measurement techniques, i was told it was my fault the blinds werent working properly in the space as measured by their instructions! give your head a shake!3000 in blinds later and i would just assume return every last one of them to this company and provide my business elsewhere.
absolutely the worst customer service i have ever received.these people are crooks and thieves and will just take your money.  i spent 1000 on shades, paid for twoday shipping and received them over 10 days later. they also came at separate times. when i called them to tell them this, the guy on the phone told me that he didnt care if i was unhappy direct quote. that i should have checked the production times.  the production time tab is the fourth tab on the page where you order your blinds. nowhere in the checkout process does it warn the customer that if you order these blinds it can take up to 10 days to make them before they are even shipped out. horrific customer service and shoddy, cheap looking products.  appalled at the way i was treated after spending so much money with their company. consumers should absolutely not shop here. trust me, i am saving you money and time. two things you cant always get back.
update 101115: we have received a full refund from this service and are satisfied with this outcome. caveat emptor...this is a review for http:www.arizonamidwife.com and its sole proprietor alicia witt. we hired this service and its proprietor based on the numerous positive reviews we found online. this is the review of a servicebusiness based on personal experience. ill cut to the bullet list...1: we paid extra for a service this business did not provide, the proprietor of this business refused to refund us for that and after much argument, partially refunded it for us. while i accepted this at the time, hindsight is always 2020 and i should have refused and just reported the business to the police and bbb for fraud. 2: the proprietor did not provide doula service as agreed upon. short of answering some questions here and there prior to the big day, we are really not sure what the  was actually for. the proprietor did not massage my wife as agreed upon, the proprietor had a poor attitude and answered questions in single syllable answers, the proprietor provided zero emotional support to my wife except for when the epidural was administered and then it was just breathing exercises, and that was pretty much it. 3: while we ended up having to do an emergency section after 12 hours or so of being admitted, at no point during the numerous hours that the proprietor was there was the proprietor truly helpful. the proprietor pretty much either ate, slept, left to eat, or sat in a chair on a cellphone. there was such little level of interaction and no explanation as to why that our nurses even asked who this person was as they cleared showed signs of not wanting to be there. their words, not ours. 4: two hours was spent leaving for lunch or dinner, and two to two and a half was spent napping. we paid for doula service which is a trained and experienced professional who provides continuous physical, emotional and informational support to the mother before, during and just after birth. 5: after the section, the proprietor stayed in the room for no more than 20 minutes to help the baby latch and then left. and that was the last we heard from them until almost 2 weeks later when my wife reached out to complain and ask for a refund. we were in the hospital for 4 days afterwards and there was no follow up. part of the service is to perform such follow up and it never happened. it wasnt until i reminded them that they asked to schedule it after we fought about the refund for the service that was never performed. i have cell phone call logs to prove this.we have the feeling now that proprietor of this business simply did not like us, from the very start. whatever the reason for that is, they had no issues with taking our money when the professional thing to do would have been to tell us they just cant work with us. maybe that isnt the reason. we dont really know. but they did actually remark when we discussed a refund they felt the service performed was exemplary. so who knows?but t that we say, you are delusional and have no idea what that word exemplary means. the service was far from it.instead of providing a nurturing environment and added support during our special day, we feel this service contributed quite negatively to it.  we paid for...a trained and experienced professional who provides continuous physical, emotional and informational support to the mother before, during and just after birth.we did not get it. we feel utterly ripped off by this business. this review abides by yelps review guidelines and is intended as a matter of opinion with regard to a service we have paid for. we are entitled to such an opinion as a customer. we are in no way affiliated with this industry or competitors of this person, and have no personal agenda other than to share our experience publicly as a result of paying for this service. you will note there is no bigotry, harassing remarks, or hate speech in this review and i would hope that should it be flagged as inappropriate the reviewers take actual note. we would urge you to look harder for other reviews, they are out there, and not all of them can be removed so easily under false pretense. you can start by joining community groups and relative forums and simply asking for personal opinions and reviews and you will most certainly have your questions answered. we wish we had done the same sooner.
to all you lovely soon to be mommas out there who are in the market for a doulamidwife and asking for referrals and reading reviews, im writing this for you! after much deliberation over the last 7 weeks, and having recently heard three other unfortunate ladies having similar issues with the same person; i decided that i need to make my story known to warn other potential moms to be. caveat emptor!i hired alicia witt of arizona midwife to be our doula after a lengthy initial interview by which she was well presented, friendly, and answered all questions to my liking. i also opted for her clinical monitrice service additional 300 which meant she would come to my house when i think im in labor and assess my progress. this was to save me from getting turned away from the hospital for not being ready. the total was 1000. we paid in full and expected the level of service implied by alicias reviews to be what we could expect. i was very wrong! on the early morning of aug 12th, i had severe pain and was showing signs of preeclampsia. i called my ob, and she instructed me to get to the hospital immediately to check the protein in the urine. unexpectedly, i was admitted and told i was in labor. my husband called alicia, and she berated him for not calling her before we went to the hospital. he explained that this is an emergency situation, there was nothing she could do regarding preeclampsia. having her come to check my cervix and vitals made no sense, and so we followed the direction of my ob.  alicia showed up at the hospital maybe a little over an hour later, and made herself comfortable in my delivery room.for the next 5 hours or so she sat in that chair and played games on her phone, texted people, made phone calls. i had previously specifically asked her during our final meeting only meeting after our interview if she would massage and support me periodically and she said of course! i am a former massage therapist, so it was important to me, knowing the benefits of touch. at no point during this time was such a service performed. once the epidural was needed, this was the first time alicia touched me. she finally stood and walked to my bed and put her hands on my shoulders while they did the injection.afterward, she left for about an hour to get food. when she returned, my sister was massaging my shoulders and trying to keep me calm. my family told me that she came in, walked right to my husbands cot the dad bed and took at least an hour nap there. my family was amazed how useless and entitled she was, as was the nursing staff.  the staff even asked while she was sleeping if she was a family member who didnt want to be there! it was embarrassing! later that evening she left for dinner and returned to find out i had not made any progress no thanks to all of her support, and now i needed an emergency csection. my family said while i was in surgery she was once again on her phone playing solitaire. my sister bought her food throughout the day in hopes she wouldnt need to leave my side, but i guess it didnt help. during the interactions with the hospital staff and my ob she was pretty much absent, only remarking on single word answers when asked her opinion. she almost never offered it up freely and provided no real emotional support to either myself or my husband. there was even a point in which my husband asked her opinion while one of the staff was present.  she agreed with them, and then as soon as she left she contradicted herself and gave a different answer. so confusing and unhelpful. by the time i was wheeled out of the or i was pretty out of it, i was told she only stayed about 20 minutes after to help my daughter latch! i was in the hospital the next four days recovering, naturally after all the excitement and craziness in the next week i hadnt given much time to consider how taken i felt. at no point did she bother to reach out or check in, and she never even followed up as part of her service offering to do so. once i heard all the comments from the nursing staff and my entire family, i decided to contact her. obviously i was severely disappointed by my experience but knew i couldnt turn back the clock. i thought it the least she could do was refund the extra 300 we paid. since due to the emergency, she never came nor needed to. she argued that she gave me an exemplary and wonderful service and that she does not offer refunds after 36 weeks.. also, that we were paying for her to be on call, and we didnt call her first. i was so emotionally overwhelmed by her rude, unprofessional and careless treatment that i just ended up in tears unable to argue. my husband called and reasoned with her and ended up getting a 150 refund, but the whole experience left me feeling taken and vulnerable. i washed my hands of it and left it to fate, that karma will step in here. however in the last few weeks ive heard from three other ladies who have recently had similar experiences
if i could give them 0 stars i would! the company is a total scam! please save yourself the timemoney! when our stackable washerdryer stopped working we searched different companies and went with them because their add stated they could be trusted, etc. etc. that was a lie! we bought a washerdryer from tony. the very next day it broke, so he came back and replaced the parts and all was good. a couple months later it started having issues again and when we called to let tony know, he said that he would come the next day to fix it. he never showed up and after callingtexting several times, he never answered or got back to us. then when we called from a different number one that he didnt know tony answered. as soon as he realized it was us, he hung up on us! we called right back and again, no answer! what type of customer service is that? we were absolutely appalled! very shady if you ask me..........
the service was the absolute worst. the waitress who served us was incredibly rude and ignorant. one of our dishes was half an hour late so when we let her know she told us shed go check but we didnt receive so much as an apology. she returned back to the bar only to continue flirting with her boyfriend. after another half hour of not getting our food we decided to leave yet she told us as we were leaving that our food was finally ready. we took the food to go. there were no apologies, no reduced pricing, no
i check out this fushion thai chinese restaurant. i order garlic chicken hot spicy. the only thing hot was the establishment itself.  no ac. very uncomfortable.food served on plastic  plate with u guessed it plastic utensils. garlic chicken very bland. i also order pot sticjers. plenty of them for the price but no flavor.i left my food after just several bites on the counter. hopefully the guy coming in as i was going out got the hint. it sucked. i wont be back.
its good if you want to see a different dr. each visit. dr. k. is rarely in and his replacement is far from seasoned. they never check charts because i had to remind everyone why i was in each visit. not to mention that assistants and front office staff display their skills as if they received their education from a cracker jack box. unprofessional, uneducated, and an uncomfortable office for me to put in charge of my health care.
so this place gets a zero for me but yelp doesnt have that option! its located inside the palms hotel and i come here every monday with my family for movie night. ive been seeing the billboards on the side of the road and the ads for the turkey dinner burger in the elevators and my mouth was watering wanting to try it. my boyfriend is never in the mood for burgers when we visit palms but this labor day i finally harassed him enough and he said yes well go here for dinner. so after the movies we trecked our way through the long hallways to cafe 6 to try this burger they so avidly have been advertising. it opens at 5pm so we got there a few minutes after 5pm and first impression was beautiful but empty. the decor is setup like a small restaurant with a lounge feel with a view of the spa pool and brick columns with digital fireplaces on display. there is a bar with three lcd tv screens showing three different sports games and one bartender. the lady who greeted us was also our waitress and she did not mention this so at first i wasnt sure we should order with her but after bringing our drinks she starting taking food orders so i guess. now on to the food, we ordered buffalo hot wings and the turkey dinner burger with skinny fries. i had a sauvignon blanc and my boy had a beer. my sauvignon blanc came out first and it was extremely sour aka cheap even for a house wine. i imagine this is what those dollar store wines taste like! so i stuck to the water. the buffalo wings came out after and i had a few they were regular as i expected but im not a fan of hot wings so this was mainly my bfs dish. after eating a couple he pulled out a wing and showed me a wing with a huge patch of fried chicken hair. gross! dont you fully clean the chicken before cooking? then my turkey dinner arrived and it looked nothing like the posters. i know that photographers photo shop but kudos to the photog because this burger looked completely different! the meat was gray and so was the bun. i bit into it and stopped midbite. what i had just tasted my brain couldnt comprehend. the taste or lack there of was horrendous! dry, flavorless and yuck, just yuck! i have never tasted something that bad ever! that was not turkey meat and i eat tofu and veggie burgers and they still have never tasted like that so i dont know what kind of mystery meat that was! i still cant barely explain just how bad it was. tasted like how i imagine diabetic hospital food would taste! no seasoning, bland, not fresh and just not good! i quickly grabbed the sour white wine to swallow my bite. i thought maybe its just the initial bite so i cleansed my pallet with the glass of water and fries and tried again. i took two more bites but on my last third bite i decided not to submit my tastebuds to such torture and gave up. i downed the glass of sour wine to get the taste of my tongue and asked for the check. another reason why i gave up was because on my last bite i noticed some gray fatty matter from the burger. i lifted up the bun to find even more gray fatty matter coming from the burger! ewe how could you put that in with the burger doesnt the chef inspect the food after he cooks it and sends it out? i so wanted to like this place and this burger but i declare that the person in the kitchen must be a line cook and not a real chef because no selfrespecting chef that loves food and loves what heshe does would send out something that grotesque! now i know why this place was so empty. you have a beautiful space and amazing advertisements but i suggest instead of spending thousands of dollars on those giant billboards you spend your money and figure out whats going on going on inside that kitchen because if that is how bad your promotional dish tastes i shudder to think how the rest of the food on the menu tastes! the only thing that was good i.e. safe was the water and skinny fries.big let down for me and im sorry to say i cannot bring myself to recommend this to not even my worst enemy.
i have absolutely had it with this place. the front end staff is rude and will make snide remarks to your face, the doctors and nursing staff are no better, and their billing department is awful. following a doctors appointment, my mother was told by the front end staff none too quietly that she had yet to pay her bill. when she reminded them that most people operate on a twice monthly salary and they have yet to expect payment for the month the girl muttered something at her and and sarcastically said ok, thats fine. she talked to her doctor about the girls attitude and her loud discussion of something private, that should be dealt with away from other hearing ears. he agreed with her and promised something would be done. well apparently he did not, because she has just received a past due notice and another bill saying she is 60 days late with her payment and that she now owes about sixty dollars more in late fees. however, my mother has a bank statement showing that they indeed received payment over two weeks ago! on the past due statement, there is a little note about disregarding it if 10 days have not passed since the payment was sent. well she sent her payment on the sixth, and they didnt send the statement until the 19th! thats well past ten days! thats three days they had to look at the payment and see that it was there, but instead they sent us this, asking for more money thats not even theirs!i have had it! this is why i dont accompany my mother to her appointments anymore! they are rude and incredibly unorganized cheats! and whats worse, they constantly assign her medication that makes her sick. shes had to stop taking some of her meds because she cant get out of the house after taking them! and whats there response when she tells them this? oh, well just cut back the dosage or even that shouldnt be happening and they make it seem like its her own fault that she gets sick; no apology, no nothing!!!  this isnt the first time a billing problem has occurred, and dont get me started on trying to call their offices! no one ever picks up! and, no one ever calls back if you manage to leave a message on their answering machine which 90 of the time is full, so you cant. then there are the wait times, which can span one to two hours just for a five minute conversation! best in the valley my behind! they have done nothing but harass my mother again and again! this time im going with her to her next appointment, and if they think i wont raise a fuss in front of their patients if they choose to bring this up in front of them, they are wrong!edit: now ive posted this on their old page, and their new one.
i have never experienced a more awful experience when going to a doctors office in my life. i was told i would see the physician since i was an initial new patient and i did not, i saw a nurse practitioner. i work in a practice as well and when you see a patient for the first time it should be with the physician. besides that, when i did see the np i explained my thyroid issue after waiting for an hour to see him and his immediate response was to get a thyroid biopsy...uh what?? he also ordered and ultrasound for after the biopsy. dont you want to know what youre looking at before you biopsy it? the worst part besides that is the front office staff and medical records. their staff are the rudest people ive ever encountered. they absolutely refused to send me my lab records. i explained to her that i had stopped a medication and needed a level to see if i should be taking it anymore because i felt awful and why should i wait a month and a half to see what it is and she actually laughed at me and said.. and what are you going to do with that lab value? treat yourself? hahaha..youre not a doctor! i replied with no im not a doctor but i am a nurse practitioner. she immediately stopped laughing and said oh and put me on hold for another 5 minutes. she looked at my records and came back and said your paperwork only says where you work not in what capacity so i cant give them to you. ummm what difference does it make if i wrote it on there or im telling you now??? so if im a doctor or np the rules are changed and i can get a copy??? when i said can you just send me a copy of my lab records she told me a flat out no. i said youre refusing to send me my records and she said yes. they got reported to health and human services as this is a violation of hipaa. its a federal law requiring them to give me my records if i ask. basically to get down to it...i was told it was their policy that you have to come in for lab results. not to mention ive now found out they were all normal. in other words, they just want your money for the copayment. my cardiologist tried to get my labs.. they told them no and medical records treated them the same way. finally my pcp had to call and make it an issue and she finally got them. i asked to speak to someone high above her and she hung up on me and transferred me to a voicemail, i still dont know who it was or what title they held because that was a month ago and they never called me back. that woman in the front office is awful and if they want to keep a business theyll have to start replacing people.update: i found out they still have not released my labs. my pcp got the few labs from the actual laboratory. there are many still missing and they still refuse to let me have them. still didnt receive a call from management or anyone that actually cares that the office is run so badly
this doctors office is terrible! front office staff is rude! they dont care if they have your business or about your health concerns. expected wait time is at least 1hr past your scheduled appointment time. my pharmacy called and faxed the office several times to get refills on 2 meds thyroid  vit d. i also left several voicemails. i finally called the office and the rude receptionist said my doctor is no longer there ??  i would need to come in for an appointment to see someone else. ok great... no guess again....they could not get me in for 3 weeks! so they want me to go without my thyroid medication for a month! since no one called to refill my script or phone me to say i needed to be seen by a new doc because mine left. i asked her to have the office mgr call me and she stated that she was out of the office and didnt know when my call would be returned. really!!! i will report to my insurance company and post on the review a doctor site. this is now way to run a business!
wrote on their other site months ago but have an update.received a bill from january, 8 months ago about paying for an ultrasound.  my insurance carrier adjusted the payment and i owe around 150 out of pocket, they basically covered hardly any of it probably because they dont believe it.  when i finally left that pos place, my new endo asked why i needed another ultrasound a year later.  she asked if i felt any discomfort with my throat and told her no.  so she didnt understand why i needed the test.  they also did a bone density test.  im a 37 year old male in very good shape.  so my new endo said that test was unneeded.  i really cant stand this place and what they stand for.  they are a big operation and dr. lalani likes to pad his pockets with unnecessary test.  hes also hardly there but takes credit for what his np do.  going to file a complaint to the medical board about my last bill.  they called me the other day about payment when i received the bill just two days prior.  they threaten a lawsuit against my mom for owing 10 dollars.  dr lalani also took a call while i was being examined, will put that in the complaint as well.
stay away from this place!!!!  amy rudest receptionist ive experienced in a long while was extremely unhelpful.  i called for over a week regarding a prescription issue without a call back.  i finally had to walk into their offices to get an answer.  the original dosage they gave me they changed it from what ive been taking for years was increased and i was bouncing off the walls.  customer service is zero....im sure without much effort you could find a doctors office....any office, with better service.oh, they also kept billing the wrong insurance company after i gave them my new insurance and made it clear to delete the old insurance....ugh.stay away....far away....read the below remarks as well so its not just me.
missing dannys and the reasonable prices and fast service. prices are too high here and takes forever. wont be coming back.
horrible service: we took 2 cars there on november 24, 2015. when we went back to pick them up 2 hours later they forgot to clean one of the cars. but the one we picked up was still dirty. trunk not vacuumed as requested, dirt and grit in the vent louvers, dirt on the gear shifter, the nooks and cranny of the dash were dirty. they sprayed their shiny slippery stuff all over the instrument panel plastic and didnt clean it off.  we paid 120.00 per car, so yes, i expect a great job to be done. but the worst part was the attitude of the staff. we expressed our displeasure to the staff and they got attitude. told me they could have done better if the seats werent from a 1960s car. yeah, twice the employee insulted me by saying its my fault they failed to clean the car because my 1995 car had seats that looked like they were from the 60s. i asked the employee for his name and he  laughed and said, i dont have to tell you, and walked away. what?, as a customer i considered that an ultimate insult. we asked to speak to a manager and brian came to see us. he listened and assigned a couple guys to our cars but all he time the thug without a name and his buddies were starring us down.  i will never, ever use them again, nor would i ever suggest anyone use them. maybe a few more complaints and brian and the management staff will take care of their bad apples.
i visited this chipotle for the first time today and it will most certainly be the last time. i ordered a chicken bowl. the chicken, and all of the meat, looked like it had been sitting there all day. i also asked for lettuce on it, there was only scraps at the bottom and instead of getting more to actually have lettuce on my bowl she just put a little. the customer service was lacking and the food was not to the same standards as other locations. i recommend steering clear of this location and going the extra couple miles for better food and service.
i hate to do this, but im very disappointed. my steak was cold and chewy, like it had been sitting out for a while. and half of my bowl was green bell peppers. yes i got the corn salsa stuff, but ive never had so many green peppers in it. i love chipotle, but im not sure i will be going to this one again. i ended up ordering from another place because i just couldnt make myself eat chewy steak.
i have never been here, but giving them a one star due to their lack of communication. i have been trying to make an appointment with them for over two weeks, and no one ever answers or calls me back. very unprofessional, and if i was able to cancel my groupon for this place i would.
scam alert:  they announced a 40 sale.  then at the register they changed the pricing and said the 40 was off of original price.  so, a sofa for 699, with 40 off  619.  be careful, they own the same store on the east side.  horrible organization!  spread the word.
furniture is good quality.service is unreal terrible. ordered a bed, dresser and mirror. two weeks later i received a call that the order was ready to be picked up. the mirror was not with the order, and they informed me that they would call me when they figured out what happened with it, and whether or not they would have to order a new one. over a week later, still no call. i finally called them back and they had the mirror, just never bothered calling. picked up the mirror, got it home, opened it, only to find that none of the hardware to attach the mirror to the dresser was included. called back and was informed that its typically about 2 weeks for that to come in. a note was put in to have the hardware expedited, but that is all that was done for the trouble.
wow. a horrible experience. the salesperson forgot to order the couch we purchased. or at least that was the reason given why it was late. and the customer service representative we called lied about why it was late until we pestered them repeatedly. when it did arrive, they did not communicate to the delivery service the correct phone number so it was delayed even further. and finally, when the couch arrived, there were multiple stains on one of the cushions. avoid at all costs.
i am so incredibly unhappy with ashley furniture. we ordered a couch, a kitchen table and 2 bedroom dressers. we placed the order in late march and we still havent received all of the items. we were originally told that we couldnt schedule delivery until all items in the order were in the warehouse. after 2 months we called and they were still waiting on the kitchen table. they said the one that came in was damaged. we finally got them to agree to split the order and deliver what they had in the warehouse. we got our dressers and our couch 2 months ago and there was a knob hardware missing from one of the dressers. we called them immediately and they said they would have one in the mail that day. still havent received it 2 months later. now, they finally have our kitchen table set in to be delivered and they gave us a 3 hour window that doesnt work for us and no option to change it. ive never dealt with a company that gives you a time slot without a choice. i called to have it changed to earlier in the day and they said i can either cancel the delivery and reschedule it out another 2 weeks or keep it.i am done with them. they cant blame every single problem they have on being a new location. they are a nationwide retailer and it cant be that different from the hundreds of other stores they have. their prices are okay compared to other furniture stores in madison but i would gladly have paid a couple hundred extra to have better service. dont expect any help from the manager either. he was extremely rude over the phone and absolutely useless. i did not deal with one competent person in our entire ordeal with ashley. worst customer service ever  avoid this place at all costs.
the saga concluded with another few weeks of waiting. the only remedy provides was a 25 dollar gift certificate. still one star. will never shop at ashley again.
ok i just loved the chicken parmesan and swiss over potatoes. soooo good!!! and soooo much food. my love ordered some burrito and normally i would have asked what kind and took a picture but i was starving and since i took one potato and cheese sauce i was done one picture and started scarfing down this yummy meal. i did pop my head up fans ask how his burrito was, he said really good. then i was back to stuffing my face. lol. my complaint is the margaritas weak as hell!!! that frozen slush tasted like a slurpee from 711 i had mango and he had strawberry after asking our server if there was any corn products in them because he is allergic to corn. she said not in the strawberry but yes in the mango. oh and they were out of passion fruit btw i love passion fruit anything!!! we there must have been corn syrup in the strawberry margarita because he got violently ill like he always does when corn is involved. this is why only one star. we checked with our server about corn in his food and his drink and told her that he was allergic to corn and corn products. apparently their staff is not trained on food allergies. im guessing fructose was in the margarita mix which is a corn byproduct. had that not happened we would have given them 5 stars.
horrible food and service. waffles were soggy. omelettes didnt taste good either. not worth the time and overpriced.
first of all, the host was one of the rudest people i ever met. i broke my ankle out at the flamingo pool and had borrowed a wheelchair from the hotel, and i asked him what the easiest way was to get through the restaurant to reach where my friends were sitting and he was not helpful. i told him nevermind, and asked if i could park the wheelchair somewhere out of the way so i could just hobble to my table. thats when he started treating me like i had a mental handicap and even started yelling at me. i was very upset and the waiter tried to assure me that the host probably didnt speak enough english to understand me. but then we ordered brunch and the experience got even worse. the bacon looked like it had been sitting on the floor for a few days and even stepped on several times. and, the bloody marys were all ice.sure, its conveniently located if youre staying at the flamingo but the horrible stomach aches and verbal abuse by the staff is not worth it.
if you know anything about mexican food, just skip it. this place is not so good. i had the charlies tacos. the meat was gross. the rice was okay. the taco fell apart after the first bite so i ate everything with a fork. my husband had a burrito which was so spicy he could hardly eat it, and he loves spicy food.  he also kept saying his drink carlos margarita, tastes like toilet water.  it was outta of a slushy machine for certain. i have never left a restaurant leaving my plate pretty full and my drink half full. waste of 
this used to be my favorite place to go to for movies. not after today. we had gift certificates that were each good for 10 each. tried to use them to pay for our concession stand purchase and the cashier wouldnt give us the change from what was leftover 8 from the certificates. ive never had a problem like this at any other theater. i mean, you pay for them, so whatever is left should be returned as change. the cashier even called the manager for assistance and he said that they wouldnt give change because the gift certificates were old. who the hell cares if theyre old? theyre still worth 10 and there is no expiration date on them. lame!!! never going back there again. their loss because we go there almost once a week and shell out about 40 each time. well take our money to a different theater!!!
used to love this theater but they started a policy where they search my wifes purse for the comfort of our guests.  how is going through every womans purse supposed to make anyone more comfortable? its an invasion of privacy and we will take our business to town square or south point.
vastly understaffed and inefficient system for opening night at star wars . bad management .
i really wanted to like this place since its so close to home and really clean, but i am very disappointed. i scheduled an appointment  for 3 people and they said it was ok. 2 of us got there and i said the 3rd person was on their way. they told us we can get started first then when the 3rd person comes someone will work on her. so as we got started the 3rd person arrived and waited about 40 minutes and no one started on her. she went outside for a bit and the guy in the front desk didnt even give her an update on whats going on. i got up from my massage thinking she was already done and the lady that massaged us said she left because no one available  to give her a massage because the masseuse left and they didnt know my number to call me.  what?! i made an appointment for 3 people. you guys dont have caller id to call me back?! or couldnt tell us right when we got there that theres only 2 people massaging?!?! told the guy in the front all that and he didnt seem to care. not even a sorry. as for the massage.. it wasnt good at all. ive been to tons of reflexology and this was one of the worst. i got an older guy and he seriously shook the life out of me. it was not a bit relaxing. sorry sunshine relaxation but we wont be back. you guys should have dealt with this situation better. save your money everyone and go to belle reflexology 10 mins away.
i recently purchased a car here. they told me there was nothing wrong with the vehicle. it wasnt even 48 hours of owning the car when the first problem came with the radiator. ive had this car for less than 3 months and it is going back to the mechanic for the 4th time now. for a car that i was told had no problems it sure is going to the mechanics allot. so i would not recommend this place to anyone.  the second time the vehicle was taken to the shop i received no help from the dealer. i stated there was a problem and was told take it to the shop and i would not receive a temporary vehicle. i had requested my money back during the first problem and was denied. i was not placed into a different vehicle as was stated if problems persisted. so the dealer was aware of on going problems with this vehicle. with the continued problems of this vehicle it feels like it has become nothing but a money pit. the fourth time of taking the vehicle to the shop was what had me decide to post any type of review since this has become such an inconvenience and cost of additional funds.
unfortunately six months after getting a used car from this dealership i was left with no choice but to replace the vehicle. i am not able to say my experience with the car i was sold was a good one. in the first 3 months the car was in the mechanics shop 5 separate times. the first problem happened in the first 48 hours. granted the dealership paid for that repair since the warranty refused to. and the fifth trip to the mechanic was also paid for by the dealer. none the less, when the first problem happened i was told that if trouble persisted i would be placed in a different vehicle. 5 separate trips to the mechanic showed a persisting problem. i wasnt placed in a different vehicle. this vehicle has been nothing but a money pit from the start. i will not be replacing the engine.     this vehicle has not been reliable. i felt i was left no other choice but to go and get a new car that is reliable from a reputable dealership. i understand that there are people that have had good experiences with getting a car from good carma. unfortunately i cannot say my experience was among them. i paid for a 3 month warranty that refused to cover repairs that were included in the warranty agreement.     so here is my revised and updated review. unfortunately i dont feel i can change my rating due to all i have experienced.
came in today for lunch and waited 36 minutes in line. i know specifically how long because i took a phone call when i walked in and when i finally got to the front looked back to see when it was. the staff was not trained properly but no one was on the line directing them, they definitely had enough hands just not using them to their advantage. i.e. 3 people on toppings and 1 setting up tacostortillas. the girl would never use the second warmer she would wait for the first tacos to be warm before starting another. this was the biggest reason why it took so long to get through the line. i watched people walk out. after all that wait i wanted a grilled fish taco and had to wait again because it came from the back. the barrier is too high and you had to yell over it and repeat what you wanted so they could hear you. i also ordered a carnitas taco and the carnitas meat was very dry and chewy like it sat on the line for too long. i know they are new so i will try again in a few months but they need to get it together... and quick.
my girlfriend and i were very excited to try this place out. never making the mistake of eating here again! we walked in,  place seemed okay,  then  we stood in line with one person in  front of us for about five minutes. when it was finally our turn to order the lady was very pleasant. i wish i knew her name,  she was the only thing about the place that wasnt terrible. as we move on down the line adding to our tacos and burrito the staff behind the counter seemed very disgruntled and was very rude to not just myself but the customer in front of us. when it was time to pay,  we waited about another 5 minutes for my girlfriends burrito to be ready. she ordered a shrimp burrito which for some reason takes extra long to make. 20.35 later and i was left with cold tacos,  stale chips,  and a burrito where the shrimp tasted off. as if overpaying for crap food wasnt bad enough,  the dining area was filthy. food trays and wrappers left all over the place,  food crumbs and mess littered table tops as well as seats. we found the only place that wasnt filthy. while eating we saw four employees take a break almost at the same time. one kid who worked there walked around and picked up trays,  then went outside never to be seen again. food crumbs still everywhere. one employee sat fairly close to us,  kicking back,  on break i assume. so it wasnt a mystery to staff that this place looked like a train wreck. bottom line,  i will never come here again,  and i will be sure to tell all of my friends in this area to never come here.
waited in line for 30min!! finally get to the front of the line then all of a sudden the girl leaves and we had to wait even more just to place our order!! not organized at all! we decided to leave and cross the street to chipotle! we werent the only ones that left they were other people behind us and left to!! i will never go back! sucks cuz we didnt even taste the food just the customer service ruined it!
worst taco restaurant ive ever been to. stood in line for over 30 mins because the girls behind the counter took their time. one lady was bad mouthing to her coworker about how my fiance and i because we were putting to many toppings on our tacos. she should not be working there. then after that she was flicking the cheese off her fingers all over the other toppings. very poor customer service!!!!! never coming back again.
i drive by this plaza all the time and i was really looking forward to eating at this place when it finally opened. all i have to say is, a big disappointment. i understand that its going to be busy because it just opened and thats natural. everything seemed very unorganized. the menu is very hard to understand and doesnt give a lot of detail about their food. as we waited in line, one of the gals that worked there was passing out samples of their chicken taquitos. it just tasted like boiled chicken wrapped in a deep fried corn tortilla. had absolutely no flavor. i ordered the bowl rito, the rice was not even cooked all the way and i was spitting out hard bits and i was eating. my boyfriend ordered the california burrito. his order took 5 min longer to prepare because it was sent to the back for prep. he obviously was not happy about that. it was also a total disaster to eat, very messy. so, im just going to pas this place up and go to chipotle instead.
way overpriced for such sub par food. no seasoning, no proper cooking technique used for the meats, etc. it pretty much tasted like everything was pulled out of a freezer, thrown into a microwave, then tossed into a steam table. i had really high hopes for this place. do yourself a favor. walk to the door, stop, look right, and head towards the chipotle you see.
cant speak for the food just yet, seeings how im actually sitting in my car with the burro i just purchased.....customer service was great until i went to pay!  apperently the girl working the register at 2:35 pm on this day doesnt like her job one bit!  rude as could be, and not only to me, but the 4 customers in front of me!  no smile, no kindness what so ever!  shape up young lady or i fear your job status may change in the near future!  this was my firsr and last visit!  grunpy people shouldnt work with the public!  managers....this one will run off more customers than shell bring in for sure!!!
very disappointing for a new place to have opened and have such nasty attitudes, before even getting in line... stood looked, walked right back out. looked over priced and not good anyways though.
waited 3 months for this place to open so when it finally did i rushed in! how disappointing. i ordered 1 lg chips and salsa, 2 steak tacos, and 1 reg drink. how do you average almost 13.00 for that? the tacos were the size of your palm, literally. there was almost nothing on them. i guess thats why they make it with two tortillas to make up for the lack of food you pay for. the manager looked like she was intimidating the girl making my food so she was scared to put anything on it. not worth 3.25  tax a piece. the chips were good but mind you it was a large. they gave me a 4 oz salsa cup filled up to 2 oz. to top off the whole visit the manager had her kids there working. there was a little boy, had to be no older than 89, come out from the kitchen to the front. no hairnet but was wearing gloves? as a 10 12 year culinary chef i know that this is obviously unsanitary and illegal. i wonder if the owner is aware of what is going on over there? ive heard many people talk about this place and every one of them has said that theyre not going back. i felt like i got ripped off to make up for building costs of the place. what a joke.
this location needs to get their s__t together or change the name to chaos tacos. the nearby chipotle must be happy to hear this kind of review.
overpriced, unorganized,  corporate office doesnt know what the other hand is doing, tempe location recently shut down. looking forward to the place that takes the peoria locations spot. go eat at rolandos!
i went into this location on three separate occasions. 1 seemed fine, the workers didnt know how to explain the menu so i kind of stuck to ordering a burrito chipotle style. tasted really good but i paid a sold 17.78 for a burrito meal.. should have gone to chipotle and treated a friend to a meal for that price! 2 gave it another chance since my co workers hadnt been in. i and another coworker ordered burritos so no issues, tasted good. my other co worker got a quesadilla w veggies.. they did not have the veggies ready so her order had to go back into the kitchen... needless to say, i ordered the same thing as last time, paid 10 this time around and my co worker finally got her quesadilla with veggies after my co worker had to complain to the manager...twice! and as we were finishing up with our burritos. she also said it was bland and not worth the overpriced amount she paid! 3 went in on a thursday night, there were ppl in there but no line, ordered my usual and they didnt have any rice made, said to wait 23, i waited 79 mins. and they were finally able to toss some from the kitchen over into my burrito,  the employees looked pissed, lazy and not wanting to be there and the gentleman that checked me out or any other staff did not even apologize for the delay in not having their main option, wtf? paid 10 this time too, had the burrito but it was very bland, disgusting. tossed it !! as we were leaving the manager like figure asked how it was and i said it was ok! he apologized because he had seen us waiting for a while and we said ok.. then he came chasing me down as i was sitting in my car with a free taco with a meal or something. no thank you. honestly, gave them 3 tries, service is horrible, food is decent, good luck figuring out what you want to order since no one knows to really help you.. and if you order something from the back kitchen, good luck getting it in time!
well...i have given this place many chances and the customer service just seems to be getting worse, not better. on the last three visits there have been a problem with each visit. two weeks ago i was over charged for a large combo. i was charged 2.59 for chips salsa and drink plus an extra 2 for the large drink. i didnt realize it until after she ran my card. the cashier looked dumbfounded and confused as to my concern. eventually, the manager came and refunded the difference. he didnt seem overly concerned his cashiers were over charging customers. the next visit i arrive well after lunch rush and before the after dinner, they were out of the pico de gallo. the manager was in the back cleaning and looked unconcerned. the managersame guy as before came out and said it would be 23 minutes. i choose to waiti had a feeling i should have said forget it at that point. 10 minutes later he comes out with the pico to put on my cold burrito. no apology for the wait. pay for my food and go to the drink dispenser and its almost all of the low calorie options were empty. mentioned it to the cashier and the manager came and gave excuses as to why it was empty. i couldnt deal with it at this point and i asked for my money back. went to potbelly two doors down. came back again today hoping, begging that they could get it together because their food is good.  made it through the order process and when i asked for an extra cup of salsa with my chips and salsa he same manager said there would be an extra charge for the extra cup of salsa. he said this was a new policy. at this point, i just sat down and ate my burrito and half my chips because i ran out of salsa. i tried to give this place a shot because its locally owned by a guy named brad i believe. i am for the local guy over the corporate giants but i doubt i will be back. go to chipotle or potbelly instead.
went to chronic on taco tuesday....tacos was 1.99...the meat was cold and the beans were trooooo salty....this was the second time i ate there and the food was horrible the 2nd time around....and the food is too expensive.;
first and only stop here. prep line was slow.  carne asada was dry.  charged over 6 for a chesse quesadilla.  no coke or dr. pepper products in the fancy drink machine.  all indoor tables dirty, trash cans full to over flowing.  too many other good places to get tacos in this town to put up with this.
food handling and cleanliness problems!also food has potential but was not fresh!
while i was there, everyones orders were getting mixed up, and instead of being apologetic, the employees were just getting angry and had major attitude toward the customers. i had 2 separate orders. one of them got lost and forgotten about while i reminded them every time they looked at me like, what are you still doing here??  the other one, i was told to wait on, because the pico was being made... but a different employee was really angry about me waiting for the pico, wrapped up my burrito and told me to forget the pico, with the worst attitude ever... all the customers seemed like they were trying to walk on eggshells, in hopes of ending up with some kind of food that wasnt what they wanted, but hopefully end up with something in the end! all in all, my 8 burrito was comparable to a 6 chipotle burrito, but without the toppings that i had asked for. the meat was tough, as it often is at chipotle.  i should have gone to a bertos, and paid 45 for what i actually asked for, in a much shorter time frame, without all the negative attitude. i wont be going back. i have never taken the time to write a yelp review until now. this place really motivated me to!
stopped by sunday at noon. short line long wait. 2 people working. after 10 minutes line not moving so i left. this place wont make it with that kind of service
weve given this place a solid try. the few times weve gone the food was good but the service is really bad! mgmt needs to hire and get the staff some help! 3 people working 2 up front and 1 cook a lunch rush is totally unacceptable and they were out of everything! not fair to the 3 people working and for the line of people that had to wait way too long. get it together ct!
i would rather eat at subway, and clearly i would rather eat at firehouse subs. there is nothing special about these subs.
been there twice first time was good. this past time i went was ridiculous i waited for 10 mins without being knowledged while im assuming the manager was talking to a worker about his schedule and left to go talk to him. finally after waiting a worker saw the line getting long...almost at the door..and started taking orders. waited 25 mins for two wraps and while the cashier was charging us the lady from the beginning comes again and starts telling them about how ppl werent doing there work and she was writing someone up. clearly she needs to get her priorities straight and work on their customer service. only person that stood out was josh who apologized several times and even offered a cookie for the inconvenience. the 1 star im leaving is for josh. even after getting my order it wasnt what i ordered.
went here for the first time tonight, and i must say.... ooouuucchhh. the staff was friendly, but they couldnt run a lemonade stand at the corner of your block. there were only three other customers there when we went and it still took 20 mins to receive our order only to find it messed up when we got home.its a new place, so you have to cut them some slack, but not a good first impression.
terrible! terrible wait time, terrible staff and higher ups i refuse to call this woman a doctor and terrible experience throughout. instead of writing a detailed commentary about the lack of this place i decided i would much rather tell you what my experience is like all the time at my current obgs office so that anyone who goes to this office knows that there are other options. at my current obgs office i never have to wait to be seen longer than 10 minutes. the staff is super friendly and always glad to answer any questions. my doctor is highly adept and well versed in his field, so much so that when i mentioned him to my perinatal specialist everyone from the front desk, ultrasound tech, and of course the specialist himself were all impressed and had nothing but amazing things to say about my new obg. most importantly though, especially since when i switched i was 27 weeks pregnant my new obg is warm, kind and genuine he also smiles and really seems to care about his patients. i regret not going to my new obg from the beginning but i was looking for someone closer my new obg is about an extra 15 minute drive but i would drive an hour or more if i had to just to see him. trust me ladies there is no reason why your experience, when it comes to either pregnancy or the wellness of your lady parts, should feel uncomfortable or less than 100 all around. happy i switched and even happier that my baby wasnt subjected to further negativity.
we had the same experience as ashley.  retried beans out of a can would be far superior to whatever they are serving. ashley pegged the nasty rice; plain old uncle bens would have been better. my wife ordered fish grilled. she received fried fish that was so bad, i was surprised the dogs ate it when we got home. if this place does not turn some serious attention to the food production, it will not be around by october. renee, my advice is to quit hanging with your friends in the dining room and singing, and get your behind in the kitchen to see what is being produced. it is awful!
worst mexican food ive ever had.. the service.. so lacking that it was non existence. took forever to get drinks and chips. and there was unbussed tables that had dirty plates and drinks on it for the whole time we where there. there was only 1 other table and a few people at the bar. meal and drinks got compd but still. over all, anywhere else is better than there. when they checked into the table, 3 out of 4 orders where wrong and it took awhile to fix that even tho they were written down  will not be going back.
service and food used to be so much better here. the staff is more interested in socializing with each other than the customer themselves. even heard a few f bombs from one of the employees.  new management also. didnt even get a hello. used to all the time from the old management. went without a drink for 20 minutes before anyone noticed...and we were sitting at the bar! and one of the only ones left. smh. so dissapointed. used to really like this place. the only thing i can say are the wings are still good. no more tacos and tequila for me. at least not the restaurant.
walked in  walked out  you can tell when sam isnt there or the regular cook.  the waitress was super rude and could care less if we left or not.  if i have to rely on the right staff being there, ill pass.  sad 
i wish i would have read the reviews before going.  place was empty yet service was extremely slow.  serversbartenders spent more time socializing than working.  during his break, one server went out front to smoke and spit in front of the window that was next to our table.  one of our dinner orders was wrong so my husbands meal was cold by the time my corrected meal arrived.  they can not classify this food as mexican.  canned green chiles, tomato sauce on rice for spanish rice, and cold beans.  will not go back!
this place had closed at a different location and opened recently at this location. this location has had several different types of restaurants mostly asian. as each new place opened no updates were done to the old dirty rundown walls, carpets, booths, etc. and halopenos unfortunately did not think cleaning, painting, repairing, and updating mattered either. the walls are dirty as are the carpet. the booth table tops are worn and chipped. the booth seats are worn and torn. it is the same old worn stuff the past several failed restaurants had in their place. if this is how they take care of and present what the public can see i hate to think how dirty the area are that we cant see, like where they cook our food. and lets talk about the food. chips appeared out of a bag. salsa was forgettable. the food, i had a burrito and my wife had chili relleno. neither of us wanted to finish our meal. with so many mexican restaurants with environments that will enhance your dining experience instead of ruin your appetite and have you wonder if you might get food poisoning, why go here. and really, the food although not terrible, was just ok. filbertos just across the street that is a drive through has much better food. there is absolutely no excuse for a restaurant to open in such a run down dirty condition.
i had the chile rellenos, i asked them to leave the green chiles off, what i got were two burnt dried out rellenos with that cheap cheese you buy in a jar for 1.99 next to the chips in the super market inside the chiles and no sauce over them at all, matter of fact everything they made here had that type of cheap yellow cheese smothered on it,  except none on the relenos , just in them!the spanish rice was the wrong kind of rice with a sweetness to it! the beans were stuck together with burnt cheese. i eat mexican all over las vegas since the fifties! this was the worst restaurant experience i have ever had!!! this is not an isolated experience, the very ingredients they are using as well as the cooking method are a extremely poor attempt at mexican cuisine. the sopaipillas were good. i felt like i had been robbed of 42.00 dollars and change after the experience! stay away....you are warned
i was so excited to try new mexico style food in las vegas, and im unhappy to put a bad review but the service was horrible and super slow.  the food was mediocre at best.  the employees arent very welcoming and seem unhappy.  i wonder if its a case of poor management.  anyhow i really hope this place excells in the valley but it is a terrible location kinda hard to find in a back corner.  worst part was the funky setup.  get it together chile addiction... willing to give one more chance in the near future and possibly change my review...
after reading good things about chile addiction i brought my family there on a sunday night, but we had a lessthanoptimal experience. from the time we entered the restaurant, we didnt get our entrees until 50 minutes later  and there were only five other tables occupied in the whole place. our drinks no alcohol license so dont expect a beer or margarita and guacamole arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but it took well over a half hour for the rest of the food to arrive. also, as we arrived the restaurant was very dimly lit the sun was setting and then when they turned on the lights everything was really bright. but when they tried turning down the lights a bit the lights started flickering. miserable.and then when the food finally arrived the disappointment continued. i was looking forward to the stuffed sopaipillas and the chiles but the whole plate was very bland. nearly everyone at our table went for the salt shaker, which i cant remember happening at any restaurant in a long time.i hate to give it one star because the two servers we encountered there were friendly, but everything ended up being a disappointment. slow service, bland food and flickering lights that almost gave me a headache? i dont think ill be back.
i lived in nnm for the first 24 years of my 28 year existence and this restaurant does not deserve to associate itself with new mexican cuisine. chile wasnt hot at all and didnt taste like much. youre better off heading over to sonic and getting a green chile cheeseburger now that they offer hatch green chile. really wanted to like this place because carlitos burritos is hit n miss and no place else to go. looks like im sticking to my freezer full of chile for now.
very disappointed ! no flavor at all.we are definitely not going back.once again all the green chile dishes had no flavor justbland.
this was terrible! the food had no flavor! i ate 2 bites, and they never even asked if it was ok. terrible food, terrible service. not addicted to this place. only got one star because i had to. :
being from tx  i was very disappointed in the food and even more with the service .. we ordered guacamole for an appetizer and waiter kept saying theyre working on it our food came out and i told him to cancel the guacamole , he probably forgot to order it and blamed the kitchen .. i ordered the steak fajitas, they were tough as leather.. the onions and bell peppers were very oily  greasy as they came out sizzling on the skillet, the beans and rice were bland, absolutely no flavor , one bite and i was done with them.. it took a while to get the condiments for the fajitas, the sour cream  splash of guacamole.. glad we canceled the   guacamole appetizer cause if what i had with the fajitas  is the same batch i wouldve sent it back, again no flavor.. my husband had the green enchiladas he said they were so so he ate them but he wasnt real happy with them.. for the complimentary dessert they bring out sopapillas before we were even 12 way done with our food so by the time we were done and ready for them , they were ice cold.. sopapillas are suppose to be nice and hot when consumed , that way the honey is slightly warm and gooey.. i asked for a fresh batch.. the service was subpar at best, i had to ask 3 different people for a small container to take home the salsa we had left over, finally the 3rd person brought it over.we definitely wont be back tired of paying good money for subpar food and service.... sorry...
rude employee, spilled coffee all over the cup dont even wipe it before give it to customer, the lid is full of coffee and it spilled on my clothes when i pick it up. the coffee taste like water.
visited this store once, once to many times. the little round button on my i phone did not work.  i looked to utube to see how to fix, i did not have all the tools. i took it to this place. they said it would cost 69 to fix and take about 45 min. to an hour. that was ok with me, i left my phone. i returned an hour later and was told it was not the button. what had happened was the battery was going bad and was swollen thus causing the contacts of the button to not connect. the tech said he replace the battery and would charge me the same 69.  i had changed batteries before, it takes about 5 minutes and cost under 10. but, i said ok, paid and left. 20 minutes later i am called by the shop, asking me to return as they forgot to put back the screws on the bottom of the phone. so,  i have to go all the way back for this. i tell them i am not a happy customer. next day i call the company, explain what happened. they apologize and say they will have the store call me.  that was a month ago, never heard from them again.  cannot recommend this store, first they should not have proceeded  with battery replacement without clearing it with me, second this should not cost 69, third they should have replaced the screws, and forth, they should have gotten back to me.good bye, no more at this store.
drove all the way there many miles because it showed they have the soda i wanted on their website however when i got there they said theyre out of it so one star for not having whats advertise andmy advice to you is to call before you bother driving all the way there i left empty handed
beware of this fraudulent business.  they go by several names, in an effort to pop up again every time their shady ways catch up with them.  they have previously gone by the names xtreme green visions, xtreme green lifestyles, the ultimate tree service, and now ultimate tree and yard work.  at least, those are the aliases i have found.  they use multiple addresses in all parts of the valley, multiple phone numbers, and multiple names.the most common aliases for the people are mike, michael carver, john, and daniel. they have 27 complaints on the better business bureau site.  angies list has blocked them for their bad practices which they have failed to resolved.  they have now created new profiles for themselves on angies list, trying to lure in more victims.i received an odd email this morning from ultimate tree and yard work llc, advertising tree service after the recent storms in the east valley.  i became suspicious because ive never done business with any other tree companies that would have my email address, so i wondered if it was xtreme green using a fake name.  i went to the web site in the email, and the wording was very similar to that on the xtreme green site.  i called their phone number and asked for xtreme green, and the person who answered admitted that it is the same company, but that it has been transferred from mike carver to a new owner.  wrong!  ultimate tree service  ultimate tree and yard work are both incorporated in arizona under the name of michael carver  the person who was the registered owner of the original xtreme green visions, aka xtreme green lifestyles, aka ... aka ... aka ... get the picture?  i have found several tree and landscape companies in the arizona corporation database  all in the name of michael carver.  he seems to pop up again every couple years when his trail of shady business practices catches up with him and he needs to hide from angry customers.i found them in 2012 on angies list, and had a negative experience.  despite the bad experience and the negative review i left on angies list, they have hounded me by phone for over three years, calling me every few weeks despite my repeated demands to stop harassing me.  once, they left a voicemail that they had come to my house with no appointment, and since i was not home, they had entered the backyard anyway it has a locked gate, so they would have had to climb a high wall, and had inspected the property and would be back in a few days to do some work, and wanted me to call for the estimate.  they refuse to leave people alone.after the weird email today and the followup phone call that confirmed that they were really xtreme green going by yet another alias, i called angies list customer service to complain that they had emails from angies list and were using those address to pursue new victims using yet another business name.  the person i spoke to at angies list found their record and said theyve been blocked for failure to address customer complaints.  she took the multiple new names i gave her, and was able to confirm that they have, indeed, created new profiles for themselves on angies list, pretending to be a new company.  although theyre using a variety addresses, phone numbers, and web address all over the place, they all use the name mikemichael carver, and claim to be a legitimate business.  angies list is shutting down the fake accounts.if you search yelp, you see the same pattern there.if these people spent half the time on actual work that they spend sitting around with a computer and a cell phone scamming people, they could actually earn an honest living like the rest of us.hey xtreme green ultimate whatever youre calling yourself this week  wanna come after me for giving you a negative review?   come on, then.  i have photographs of the work i complained to angies list about. i have video of you on my property. i have recorded every phone call with you.yelpers ... save your time and money.  avoid these clowns.
wow... bad.. have been here several times and the only thing that is consistent is the beer hard to mess that up. food has come out under cooked, soggy, quality is poor and the kitchen service terrible. go spend your money else where if you plan on eating.
cheese burgers, beers and...... a disgusting dirty bar.... eat up folks..... good food, unhealthy dead bugs and rotting old food..... big disappointment for the high price for just a few beers and a snack too.... and we mentioned it to the bartenders and they just shrugged their shoulders and asked us if we wanted another. they are ok, but really need to clean their act up and get this place in shape!!!
went there last night with friends. the food was ok, service ok, but the biggest complaint was price. my wife and i had 4 mugs of beer, a burger meal each and an appetizer and we spent over 80. the appetizer was hummus, which consisted of about a tablespoon of hummus, a couple table spoons of some guacamole with carrots, celery and toasted pita. understand it was happy hour too. ill have to look at the receipt, but either we got ripped off by the waitress or the restaurant. either way, i could have gone to the parkview tap house for half that and had a better meal and beer.
slow service at the bar. forgot to enter our appetizer order. my build your own burger did not have what i ordered on it. i asked for medium and it was definitely rare. this was a second chance for this location and i am disappointed again. just trying to leave and i cant even get my tab. just asked for the second time. finally got it. bye bye. never again
some people like pickles and some people dont.  i hate pickles!  the smell and taste are just awful to me.  i went with my wife and kiddo and we ordered a bunch of food.  i got the burger that is on the happy hour menu and i asked for it with no pickles.  shocker i know.  well it had pickles on it.  usually i will just take them off and it will be okay but these pickles must have been in some very potent pickle juice because all i could taste was pickle.  needless to say i didnt eat it.  i tried to give some to my little guy toddler but he didnt want it.  he was content with mac  cheese, pretzels, and chicken strips.when the server, carley, finally came around to check on us she took are order and never came back i told her we needed the check and i asked her if she put no pickles on the order.  she said she did, and she saw the pickles sitting right there.  she said she would ask the manager what she could do.  it turns out nothing what the answer!  how do you mess up someones order and then not take care of it.  they didnt take it off the bill, or offer to make me a new one, or a dessert or anything.
do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant. although the food is really tasty, this was the worst service i had ever received in my entire life. we had a three course meal with a glass of sangria and there were only 4 tables in total. we had to ask three times for a glass of water at arrival. the server would take our orders one by one for each service which did not leave the cooks enough time to prepare the next course on time. after 2 hours of sitting down, we had only drank our glass of sangria and ate our appetizer. then, after 2 hours and 15 minutes, we received our main dish. portions were very small. also, we did not even bother to order the dessert as im sure it would have taken another 45 minutes to get. it was a shame.
ive been waiting to try this place out.... just pulled up and doors were closed. its 3pm. it says open 7 days 11ammidnight... i guess ill try another time...
all i can say is wow. so you spend 23.00 dollars at carlitos mexican grill. it takes 45 minutes to get your food. i ask wheres my rice he says oh sorry were out nothing compensated for it. then we get this one salsa. wow my wife asks for more they try to charge .25 cents and finally gives us one more. oh ok. what a joke two salsas for all our food. thats four tacos and a quesadilla. thank god for red estillo.
the fish tacos arent as good as they say.the tacos are cold and only have one small miserable piece of fish.we waited for almost one hour  just to be disappointed.the food isnt worth waiting you can find a better place.
i was told this was one of the better more authentic mexican food restaurants in the area so i absolutely wanted to give it a try. so what totally makes a good restaurant isnt just amazing food but the amazing service. and thats not something we received today. from missing promised chips and salsa to one person getting their food so fast he finished it before the rest of the party got theirs i am disappointed. the atmosphere is also cramped and during its busier times is super crowded. the food also took longer than normal to be served. the food itself was mediocre at best. definitely can get more flavor from the nicos around the corner. the only thing i seemed to like were the refried beans. was hoping for more disappointment
stay away from this place..far away. tuesday night 7pm four of us. service was slow...waiter had attitude and the food was underwhelming...the girls ordered eggplant parm..had to send back..unedible.the guys ordered the 12 oz ribeyes. the meat was such poor quality that one was sent back and i was so hungry i attempted to eat it. the sides were all served cold and the bread was microwaved. all in all this was a horrible dining experience..never again...
being a diamond member we do not have alot of expectations.  as a customer we do expect friendly service even if is july 4th but  we were treated badlly by the sarcastic tone of the hostess.  the price for the buffet was cheap but we hit the road and paid 34.99 for buffet elsewhere cause if the initial person you meet has no manners we expect it will go downhill from there.  so goodbye bucca and if ever you are experiencing a revenue drop look towards the young caucasian women at the hostess podium.  cheers and best of luck
i was expecting a delicious meal and lots of fun! this is not what my party received, buca de beppo is a delicious italian restaurant. so please dont mistake it with buca cafe italiano! one of my biggest complaints  was the restaurant was empty and yet we waited 45 mins. food was cold and fish was overdone. they brought the food out and while one person was finishing up another was just getting served. i say viva la pasta some where else!save your money!!!
i thought the location at the excalibur was bad, which it was, but this buca trying to be something its not, is horrible. management was called to a table next to us to deal with an issue, and what a joke. im not sure who owns buca cafe, maybe some underperforming chain, but the food, service and everything about it, sucked.
called your ballys restaurant this week to make a reservation with a specific waiter my husband and i had on our first date. its our anniversary. got there tonight only to be told waiter isnt working tonight. hostess was very rude and disrespectful. way to ruin a special night. wont ever be back
my companion and i have attended a lot of conferences in vegas; big conferences that provide buffet breakfast for their thousands of attendees.  the included breakfasts weve received at these conventioncenter steam tables are several times better than what we had here last saturday.we were looking for a place with much better reviews called sterling buffet, which appeared from our phone maps to be somewhere inside ballys a hotelcasino im not familiar with.  but no ballys employees that we asked could direct us to this place.  they pointed us to buca.  one pointed us to blt steakhouse.  several of the people we asked couldnt even speak english.  what we should have done is entered the concourse to paris las vegas and noshed at the creperie or nearby bakery.  but we were dumb and impatient.  friends, dont make the same mistake we did.  turn around, and run, run i say, to the paris concourse.we waited in a fifteenminute line to enter this den of suck, despite the fact that anyone could see from the line that the restaurant was barely 13 full.  as we were waiting, the hostess announced that things would be buffetonly from here on out, no more ordering.  no more waffle bar, no more omelets, no more cookedtoorder dishes.  all right, whatever yet another point at which we should have turned heels and run, but alas, we did not.multiple hostesses came and went, tapping things into the console at the hostess station, but not seating anyone.  maybe one party would get seated every five minutes.  its got to be really hard to find available tables when more than twothirds of them are vacant, and its a buffet, so the level of waitering required is minimal.  how do places like this stay open?when we got in there, for 13, you get your choice of liquidy, oily scrambled eggs, bacon crumbs floating in grease at the bottom of an empty stainless serving bowl, limp hashbrowns, two driedout link sausages, limp french toast slices, a selection of fruit running the gamut from unripe honeydew to unripe cantaloupe cubes, and yogurt and cereal with an empty pitcher of milk.a waitress came over with two water glasses, one of which was cloudy at the bottom, as if still coated in dishwasher soap residue.  we asked her to replace it; she did.  when we were about halfway done glumly eating or shoving aside the truly gadawful prison fare that wed salvaged from the buffet, our waiter finally bothered to come around asking if wed like something to drink.  for reasons i couldnt tell you, he brought two more waters, so we now had four water glasses on the table.  unlike any other breakfast buffet ive ever been to, including in europe, coffee was an additional 2 charge.  he brought two cups of it, though only one of us ordered it, and charged for the unused cup he did remove it from the bill upon request.the flatware was dirty and spotted; i scraped a tomato seed off my fork; the spoon was filthy and unusable.  i asked for a replacement, but it never came.  my companions spoon was dirty, too, so i ended up just wiping down and using the spoon handle to stir my coffee.this place...its where hope goes to die.  dont do it, folks.
fried rice is a nogo. poor taste and we had a stomach bug due to this. chicken manchurian also very bland and the chicken was very chewy. totally disappointment.
my portabella panini was basically just cream cheese and bread... easily the worst panini ive ever had.
went through the drive thru and ordered a simple cup of coffee and a smoothie....pretty easy right ? well not for this place ! we waited forever.  we were the only car in line so it wasnt like they were busy. no apology from the staff for the long wait. the coffee was cold and the smoothie was warm by the time we got it. definitely wouldnt waste any more money on this place. first and last visit !
ive been here a total of three times. the third time was the straw that broke the camels back. the first time i ordered the veggie sandwich with no sauce. it had sauce, a lot mayonaise looking sauce. i dont do mayo, so when i took it up to the counter, she grabbed it out of my hand so hard the sandwich slid from the plate. my lunch partner was done eating by the time they brought me a different one. its literally just bread and veggies. no cooking required. the second time i ordered just a bowl of soup. from the time i ordered until the time it was given to me was 23 min. when i told the food runner, she said well the drive thru takes priority. rude. today i did the drivethru thinking it would be much faster and its the closest place to work i can get soup without getting out of my car. it wasnt quick by any means but it was decent. i ordered a halfsandwich and a cup of soup. i ordered asiago bisque. im thinking its like a tomato bisque but instead of tomatoes they used a boatload of cheese. ham. it had ham. why? i dont eat ham, i cant eat ham. so now here i sit with a cup of soup in the garbage can there was no one at work to give it to and a belly thats not quite full. three attempts. three disappointments.
dont fall for their buy 5 get one free cookie deal! its no deal, each cookie is regularly 1.79, so i got 5, and was charged 1.42 for 6! the manager tried to explain that is how it it equals one free, but if you do the math 51.798.95 and 61.428.52, so you save exactly .43cents, how is that one free cookie??? and 11 for lunch, which includes a nearly empty bag of potato chips?! i think ill stick with the 6 footlong at subway or blimpies! the cookies are good there and cost much less!!!!!!!
i typically do not write review much on yelp but this company did not honor their website pricing.   they have clear cut pricing on their website yet when they came over they nickle and dimed us and charged us 35 more than the pricing on the website.  after moving all the furniture out in anticipation for a cleaning at a fair price its not ethical for a company to come in and say that our carpet was quote too dirty for the agreed price.  do not use this company unless you want unprofessionals to come clean your floors.
fresh carpet care advertises all over including california where we made the mistake of using them. they also use the following two telephone numbers, 6195673788 and 8884181738. they likely have even more numbers for the same company which they use to advertise with. they are also know as fresh and green .firstly, i would not call this company a carpet cleaning business. it is more of a recruitment service for independent carpet cleaners and carpet cleaning businesses. of course, you dont know that and they wont tell you this. basically they have no equipment themselves and farm everything out. they are notorious for quoting you one price on the phone based on their web site and then when the cleaner gets to your home they jack the price up. unfortunately, we did not find this out until after the fact when i researched their company. there are many complaints regarding their business practices. if you go to ripoffreport .com and type in their alias fresh and green you will see a very in depth background on them along with other company names they use to conduct business under including fresh carpet care. you will find in this report the company name fresh carpet care with the telephone number 6195673788 and the web site http:www.freshcarpetcare.com so there is no doubt that this is one of many companies owned by the same corporation so to speak.the carpet cleaner tech told us that 120 for the 5 rooms and a hallway would be done with a machine that is much smaller and one that he did not recommend. he said it is not as powerful and therefore will not do as thorough of a job as the bigger machine, which of course will cost more money. this is clearly a bait and switch tactic but when you have already moved your furniture and are counting on getting the work done they kind of have you over a barrel. so we reluctantly agreed to have him use the better machine and pay the higher price of 220. we reasoned that spending less money only to get a poor job done would not be acceptable. little did we know what a mistake that was.i believe that one of the big reasons they do this is that the representative is in on the scam and knows that fresh carpet care will be keeping most of the money originally booked. i would say that the carpet cleaning tech would be lucky to get 2040 to show up and anything above that he will have to up sell to the customer. so in our case this worked out great for the carpet cleaner tech and bad for us considering he likely was able to keep 120140 for himself especially if he is able to get your money without writing a receipt which is what he tried to do with us. no receipt means he could tell the company we only paid 120 instead of 220. in our case we paid cash but we insisted on getting a receipt which the carpet cleaner reluctantly give us with disappointment. i am sure since there is a receipt now he probably had to report the full amount to fresh carpet care and likely had to pay them a percentage of the up sell.ok, so the worst part of all this is that you think for the 220 you are going to get a really great job. well that was not the case. it took the guy all of 20 minutes to tell us that all 5 rooms and the hall way were done. we were shocked when he said he had done everything. obviously, you can not do 5 rooms and a hallway that fast without cutting some major corners. needless to say we really felt scammed but felt vulnerable and just wanted to get him out of our home. we paid the money and as they say live and learn. never again. hopefully this will help others avoid being scammed by this company or any other one that operates this way. make sure you research who you hire a look for many good references. had we followed this advice we would have had a better experience. i even spoke with a well respected carpet cleaning pro who told me that it should have taken at least 1.5 hours minimum which sounds much more reasonable than 20 minutes.
i had an awful experience with freshcarpetcare also known as freshcarpetcare.com. the man arrived at my house after attempting to book several appointment times. when he arrived he was acting extremely strange and i noticed he was in a brown minivan with no company name on the vehicle. he started bringing in old equipment and bottles that were unmarked. he then told me he was going to test the carpet and wanted to know if i could pay more. he was extremely forceful in his attitude and clearly expressed to me that he would not do the job that i was quoted which was 3 rooms for 69. when i told him that i was not interested in the upgrade of 110 he became very angry!! he scared my 8 year old son who ran and hid in the bedroom and shut the door. the man started yelling in his native language. i told him in a very polite tone that i thought it just best if he left and that i did not want to proceed with any carpet cleaning services any longer. he was so scary that i just wanted him out of my house! he became even more angry and threw the hoses to the machine down and started yelling. i ignored his behavior and just prayed he would leave! when he was outside, i shut the door behind him and locked it. i heard him say, you disgusting people! then he sat in his van for another 10 minutes. i was so terrified and thought of calling the police. when i called the company i was put on hold for over 10 minutes and then they hung up on me. he finally drove away in his van. he then called my cell phone repeatedly over the next hour. i did not pick up. the entire experience was very disturbing!! i do not recommend this company at all! the number for them is 8884181738 but the technician has a different number. i found out that the company actually sends out independent technicians. i have learned my lesson and from now on i will only call companies that i know are legit! be careful with this company!!
the spring roll was the worst i ever had the food was not good the employees were extremely friendly but couldnt stay off the phone him and another guy cat handling their phones it was extremely cold in there made it uncomfortable to sit there they never came by to ask me how my dinner was i would have told them the truth it was disgusting the place was extremely clean and the staff was friendly but i would never go back i wasted money on food that was not good there are too many photos of places out there that are wonderful i read the reviews thought it would be good but it wasnt i would have complain to the people if they ask but they were so nice so i just paid and walked out and went and had dinner somewhere else
thought i would pop into this new nail salon since it is so close to my home!  unfortunately it was not a great experience.  the person working on my nails was talking to others in the salon.  leaving me several different times to go do something in the salon.  no personal attention.  you want to go get your spa treatments and relax.  the salon is beautiful and the chairs are comfortable but the staff is not attentive or gentle during the manicure process.
if i could give it no stars i would...looks nice from the outside, the servers at the front are very inviting, but the service inside is horrible...our server offered us the specials, but when the food came out it was all incorrect! i guess the things we ordered were not part of the special even though she said they were...they did nothing for us and simply served us the food...berenice our waitress was nice but she lacked basic knowledge of the menu which ultimately led to extreme dissapointment...over all the experience was mediocre to say the least, the food was not too bad but one could have over seen it if service and knowledge of menu was better...definetly not coming back and so should anyone reading this!
bland guac, had to ask for extra serrano peppers, onions, and cilantro to jazz it up. no lime though. flat soda, request for replacement never came. tiny  margaritas. not worth it. almost empty restaurant with slow service. disappointed in our first vegas dining experience.
screw this place. warning all californians this company sucks. apparently vertical ids are not accepted because some nitwit of a waitress wasnt smart enough to notice fake ids and the employers dont know how to properly train their employees. its vegas, check moron. and we are not accepted to drink here. so unfortunately corporate decided that people loose their jobs for serving vertical idd 21 year olds. this place doesnt deserve a star. just a horrible, ridiculous company. i hope you loose more good paying customers.
wouldnt accept my brand new vertical california drivers license. enough said. this is the worst place in vegas.
i have never experienced food this sub par. unbelievable. this is a 24 hour joint located inside ballys las vegas. i have been alive on this earth for 35 years. i live in southern california. i am not mexican. but i know mexican food. and this place served the worst mexican food i have ever eaten. good part? open 24hours. full bar. full bar is what you are going to need to swallow this garbage. we ordered fish tacos. quite possibly the saltiest and nastiest morsels ever created by gremlins. i am not going to call the kitchen staff cooks. because that means they know how to prepare food. these creatures create the worst things ever known to man. might seem like exaggerating. if you dont believe me, go ahead. i dare you to eat their trash. also ordered the nachos. supposedly meant for 3 to 4 people. they spill a bag of tortilla chips and spray random acts of chicken, crema and bean residue on there and expect you to pay 15 bux for it. these people have no business serving dog food. one star for the full bar and show. the food got a lot of laughs. harsh review you think? try eating here.
very disappointing rules that corporate has established.  its hard to imagine that they would not serve a 21 year old because the california dl is vertical and not horizontal.  wtf
i am one of the friends who was with the recent reviewer evonne li wont rehash everything she said before because she is 100 on point this is one of the worst places i have ever eaten at and it will be the last timemy tacos were so greasy and oily that i got a stomach ache afterwards. disgusting, nor will i get into the clusterfuckery of a salad that my poor friends had to choke down and be charged 12 dollars for.i didnt know that when you order a side a guacamole it actually means they take the avocado that already comes on your salad and chop it up and serve it in a side dish. nice. pretty pathetic.  i expect a place that calls themselves a mexican restaurant to know what guacamole is.  i ordered the beef tacos and got pork then the waitress said they didnt have beef but then another friend who had tacos got beefwtf? you cant just replace a food item without telling the customer . do the staff even know the menu?but i digress a 3rd friend who ordered tacos, received them so spicy she got such a terrible stomach ache that we had to get medicine, the menu showed no indication it was spicy. thats a big thing to miss. major fuck up. the waitress failed to even write down our orders and low and behold they were messed up. then the bill was wrong 3 timesas a former waitress i understand mistakes happen but no offence the place wasnt that busy and you should always write down the orders and actually check on your customers. terrible experience. do not eat here if you expect real mexican food because most of it comes from a can. its obvious. try using fresh ingredients, that might helpthis place is a joke. do not waste your money.
i am the friend that was with evonne l. and stephanie w.  and im having a hard time understanding how i got beef tacos and my friend wasnt able to.  and, as pointed out by evonne l., having meat in a salad that was supposed to be vegetarian is unfuckingacceptable. oh, and the tacos swimming in grease were a nice touch, along with my sierra mist that actually turned out to be seltzer water.  yeah, wont be coming back to this shithole again.
terrible place to go waited 25 minutes after they sat u.s. and still no service and the place wasnt even busy would not recommend
ate dinner while in town for a conference.  i assumed mexican food would be safe but i was disappointed. the service was good and my waitress willingly accommodated special allergy requests.  but i ordered tableside guacamole and was told they couldnt serve it due to the avocado shortage.  which is news to me; every grocery store i have been in the past several weeks had plenty of avocados.   so they brought me a serving of awful guacamole like you would buy at a gas station. i should have sent it back but didnt. surprisingly my tacos had a small side of normal guacamole that was acceptable.my wine was soso the chips were mostly small broken pieces and the fish tacos were decent. upon more thought it was a bad experience and i would definitely not go back.
one star because no option for zero.we were seated promptly. after that, pure crap. i believe all the five star reviews for this shit hole were made by people that either work, have friends that work here, or they actually drank all 40 something shots of tequila then made their review! our overly tattooed server acted like she was on some kind of drugs. she was confused to what went to what table and took 10min each between bringing menus, waters, drinks and chips. we were also told that there was a guacamole shortage, but yet she brought out this green slime crap. it may have been blended limes with some type of salsa? i think? when ordering they didnt have the items we wanted, so i asked our space alien waitress what she recommended and ordered that. during this hour wait i was entertained by the confusion of the other wait staff. at one point a cook came out and had a argument with our waitress! the manager came to us and apologize for the wait and said 5 more minutes. what deception! after about another 12 minutes i had enough. i shouldnt have paid my bill and left, but my date said to ask for the bill. instead i asked the hostess to get our bill and cancel the food order. she vanished along with the rest of the staff?? alien abduction? i left 30 on the table since the drinks were around 15 a piece and i think the chips and salsa were free? i usually dont wait over 2 hours for food, but a previous 5 star yelp review said it was worth the wait. i came to vegas to do multiple things and not wait all day for crap food.  the chipshorrible! a step up from cardboard.     salsa little less taste and freshness than generic brand at walmart.  green slime stuff  very unique sour with bitter at same time.im thankful they didnt bring the food, because i didnt risk the chance of food poisoning.
worst dining experience this place doesnt even deserve 1 star.so i came here because i was really hungry and needed something to eat right away and boy do i regret ever coming here. first of all the service sucked although once i voiced my disappointment the manager and my waitress suddenly become attentive! i was seated and waited about 5 minutes and yes 5 minutes is a problem when you are starving and the place is completely empty before receiving a menu while the hostess chatted away with a waitress or someone. i actually got out of my seat and walked up to her to ask for a menu. once i had the menu i looked at the prices and everything on the menu is ridiculously expensive but i thought i would enjoy the food anyways because i love mexican. we ordered guacamole with chips and it was actually awful. the guac for the price is a slap in the face. the guac has no onions, lemon taste or tomatoes or anything that a real guac brings except for avocado. literally the guac is just smashed avocado. we literally asked for a cup of onions and tomatoes and fresh lemon and made our own at the table. like seriously?!?!i could already tell this place sucked and should have left right then and there but i stayed and gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. i ordered the enchilada  and my date ordered a burger. the enchilada was absolutely disgusting. actually, the worst enchiladai have ever had in my life. first of all, the food arrived cold, yes the enchilada was cold. and it looked extremely sad. they sell the enchilada as having salsa verde, onions and avocado but those things are only garnishes. what a rip off!! three pieces of onions and three sad pieces of avocado. even writing the review is pissing me off again. i called the manager right away and voiced how disgusting the food was and right away was comforted by the manager who was trying his best not be embarrassed. i thought i would order the quesadilla so that the restaurant could redeem itself. the manager kept telling me the food would be out right away. but i dont want fast food take your time making my food. i do not want it undercooked or rushed in anyway. i rather wait a little while for really good food than have it fast and it be below average. the quesadilla was ok but only because they were trying so hard and i couldnt even finish the entire thing because of my anxiety over the whole ordeal. everything about this place sucked and i really hope my review stops anyone from coming here until they get a new chef, a new staff, and change their menu around completely. total waste of 
this restaurant has a ridiculous policy to not serve alcohol to anyone with a vertical drivers license even if they are 21 years old or older. i dont even understand how a place can even exist in las vegas and within a casino of all places, with such a rule. dont even bother, go somewhere else.
bough  half dozen assorted, also had a voucher for dozen free glazed donuts...well they didnt honor it. fine print says all locations...not all participating. anyways they told me we can give you 1 free donut. i was no give me my voucher back. ill have to go to 43rd  indian school. these donuts here are like the knockoffs they tasted blant. retraining for the whole staff i wont be coming to this location any time soon.
most restaurants i have a drive through either have one person taking orders and one person doing handout, or a person that can take orders and do handouts at the same time.the krispy kreme method, no matter how long of a line there is, is to take one order let that person mosey up to the window and then completely handle their order while making everyone else it back in line at the ordertaking station.  if you are in any kind of hurry at all, and you even see one car pull in to the drive through and front of you, the best thing for you to do is do a uturn and go to the quick trip down the street to get your donuts. youll be sitting there for 15, 20, even 30 minutes waiting for your order while they slowly service the people in front of you.  ive learned this the hard way on three different occasions.  now i only stop there if there are no cars in the drivethrough. if theres a car or a line, youre going to spend a long time waiting for your krispy kreme donuts. very slow service.
i was excited to try their iced lattes instead the lady just gave me iced coffee and still charge me for an iced latte !!! im not even going to complain i just wont come back and ill write them a review!! how do you not know how to make an iced latte but yet you work that department very disappointing definitely will not come back i rather just go across the street to mcdonalds for my ice latte !!!
i went yesterday to get some fresh hot doughnuts and i was very disappointed after waiting 15 minutes in line and opened my box after getting on the freeway. my original glazed doughnuts looked days old. they were cold and looked like they were just thrown in my box. i wanted to turn around but i was already on the freeway. i ate one, my son and my husband ate one too and they tasted cold and hard. i couldve just drove to walmart across the street from my home and wouldve been just as satisfied. i wanted my warm original glazed doughnuts! this is my first time ever experiencing this at any krispy kreme. they definitely are in need of new staff!
came here through the drivethru and after waiting 15 minutes in line expecting hot and fresh donuts, they were cold. extremely disappointed. i usually go to the location on indian school, which is great, but this location is new and a lot closer to my house, so i figured i would try them out. definitely not worth the convenience of not having to drive, and i do not recommend coming here if youre accustomed to the quality of krispy kreme!
i have been there two times now. the donuts on both occasions were dried out cake donuts. service was poor too. i have been to real krispy kremes many times, this isnt how their donuts are. there are much better donut choices out there.
they always run out of everytime i go there. last time i went, the donuts were old and hard! they lost my business!
we usually go to a place in spring mountain but my fiance and i decided to try this place out since its close to our house. the employees seemed pleasant but the experience was definitely below par. we both chose the 75 min hot stone service. we were taken into a private room similar to ones in chinatown. they start off on your shoulders while you sit on the footstool of what looks like a recliner. the massage was ok and incorporated some stretching which was nice. the pressure, however, was very light even after asking. i told the person working on me that i had a stiff neck but they did not address it until i asked multiple times. the worst part about the whole experience was that both therapists repeatedly left the room for extended periods of time throughout the session. i even tried telling my therapists that this was our first time there in hopes that they would be a little more focused. a little while later, he walked out of the room again! this happened so frequently and for such a long duration that we ended up deciding to leave. we were really looking forward to finding a good spot near the house but i guess well have to keep looking.
dont go here ever they dont respect the groupon that they have for 14 they told me i had to pay 20 even though groupon had it for 14 for 1 hour horrible customer service. its not my fault that according to them groupon screwed up
megan is incredibly rude and the policies are inconsistent.  below is the information i submitted to groupon regarding my experience.please read before purchasing a groupon!!!  i will update my review once i receive feedback from either simplicity or groupon.i was informed by megan that i would not be able to use my purchased groupon to treat my underarms today.address:  19420 n 59th ave e510, glendale, az 85308date and time:  82215  3:30pm for my scheduled appointment timenames:  megan  manager at the simplicity glendale location had an attitude as soon as i pulled out the grouponreasons:  it is against simplicitys policy to allow groupons to be used on the same treatment area; however, its not mentioned on groupons website or simplicitys website and their corporate office is closed during the weekends so i couldnt reach anyone to confirm this.  also, megan said she informed me about this policy 2 months ago when we spoke over the phone, which wasnt the truth.  she said she noted it in my file and after letting me review my file, nothing was mentioned about groupon or promotional packages.  how embarrassing for her to lie to a customers face!!
extremely disorganized hostess station. seating everyone out or order. kitchen was extremely backed up even though restaurant was half empty.
their food is great; but cant in good conscience give my patronage to an establishment that employs people with such an appalling insensitivity to those with disabilities. i was there earlier today for brunch and i literally overheard who i presumed to be the manager poking fun at one of their own staff members who, i presume was hardofhearing because she was wearing a hearing aid. i overheard him say hey, can you hear me!?, and the other servers joined in to  laugh at her. they laughed. i was so disgusted that i almost spit my food out so i could just pay my bill and leave. i have friends who are deaf and theres nothing amusing about the challenges they face. i think its widely agreed that there is enough ignorance and petty bigotry floating about in this world as it is, id really prefer not to have to deal with it while i eat. thanks, but no thanks.
the food is as good as mcdonalds. the managmet team has no idea what they are doing. the place is dead and still servers cant get orders right. this place has a lot to improve on if they think they can be competitive in this area for breakfast. i may never be back.
philadelphia should sue this place and make them remove philly from the name. bland, tasteless, small portions; real cheese is extra. it was so bad that i reinstalled my yelp app. ive eaten at charleys elsewhere and not been horrified, but this particular restaurant took an already questionable iteration of a classic sandwich and drove it straight into a truck stop toilet.
i ordered an 11 steak sandwich. they gave it to me in a bag. when i got my sub all the meat was out of the sandwich in the corner of the bag.
we were initially impressed when the rep came by to give us a quote.  however, when we began to ask questions about the companys licensing and practices for outofstate moves, they seemed to drop us like a hot potato.  may be good for local moves, but in over their heads for long distance moves.
horrible customer service!!!  the manager dustin was very rude and hung the phone up on me.  what jimmy johns doesnt deliver a mile from their location anyway?
we love jimmy johns. but they might want to rethink their serious delivery slogan. we live 1.4 miles away and they wouldnt deliver because we are on the wrong side of town... youd think a delivery area would be an equal radius around their location, not just to one side.
2.2 miles down the road and they wont deliver. you have officially lost my business. not surprising since just about every business in your complex seems to fail.
worst bbq experience ever. owners came out. i know it was soft opening, but they had no chicken or pork. the ribs were so tough we couldnt eat them. the rub was good, but they ruined it with bbq on top of it. the turkey is lunchmeat with what trays like artificial smoke flavoring. all sides are canned or boxed and taste like it except they add a pineapple or cranberry . ... probably the worst bbq in the area you can have.
you call this barb q? the meat i had was pork tasted like beef and was not smoked at all! it was shredded porktender to be fair! i do not see this place lasting...they were out of 3 items including french fries! come on! how are you out of french fries!! plus it was expensive! 2 sandwiches and soft drinks 24.00!
i was honestly not really impressed with lacys. after a recommendation from a southern transplant, i had high hopes. i was sorely disappointed. the sides are, like another reviewer stated, comparable to premade grocery store deli food. the sauce is sickly sweet, the meat just averagely prepared. also, i asked if the coleslaw was vinegar or mayonnaise based and the owner kind of laughed at me and said its cole slaw. i was like, which kind? just answer the question, dont smart talk your customers.
came here in a saturday evening.  had a bad feeling when i  walked in and saw only one diner on a saturday evening.  i ordered a slab of ribs,  cole slaw with pineapple,  potatoe salad,  baked beans and greens. now i have to add i placed this order to go.  service was good but when i received my order only two if the sides were there.  they corrected the order.  now the food.  ribs were very very undercooked.  had to finish them in my own oven when i got home.  is there a rub on these ribs?  could not tell with the sloppy runny bbq sauce.  average flavor.  baked beans no big deal no spices to speak  of stood out.   potato salad and greens were hit heavy with vinegar. ..one star.  and cole slaw again too much vinegar.  poor quality.  as a side note so much smoke hanging in the air my shirt the next day smelled very smokey. will not be found back.  too expensive and under average food.
i use to go here all the time since my family likes it. we were their very first customers too and they were very kind the husband who treated us with lassi and everything. now whenever i go in to get food its one excuse or another. i told his wife im a regular and shes like oh i dont know you. and i said is there some type of discount since i buy a good amount of food to feed the fam and shes like yeah check in to yelp so i did and then shes like okay ill give it next time i was like wtf ?! and then next time i come in shes like oh we dont hand it out after 1 pm. her words im like are you serious????? i dont like going here just because of her shes very sly and as a previous business owner i dont recommend being shady to someone thats been a regular at your restaurant since the day you opened and was your first customer. overall i dont come here anymore because she is very shady and she lies about her offers promotions and she claims shes indian but i dont believe she is as for the food its average. im indian and ive ate better indian food in vegas. the food they hand out isnt prepared fresh and the tastefavors are not consistent however if youre a college student and want cheap indian food then its the place for you.
i ordered food from through eat 24... the delivery time was great but i received combination noodles instead of combination rice. of course i didnt notice it until the guy had left, so i was stuck with the wrong order and everything else was so disgusting. the meats were rubbery and the general tso was overcooked and hard. i will never order from them again. so overpriced for such poorly made food. im very disappointed.
it was dead tonight and the service wss very slow, the won ton noodle soup had no flavor at all and the orange chicken was practically all breading. not sure how this place has 4.5 stars. the beer was very overpriced also. overall, not good at all and never coming back.
super belle place. renove au gout du jour. menu appetissant, mais lorsque nous recevons nos plats quelle deception! grilled cheese au canard avec fromage oka servi sur pain de compagne...quelle superbe idee... gros morceau de canard probablement cuit la vielle et qui puis est sec! pas assez de fromage. garni avec des oignons plates sues a la poele sans assaisonnement.foie de veau...belle assiette. mais encore ici zero gout. puree fade. carotte et betterave...plus quordinaire. piece de viande...belle cuisson fondant...mais qui ne goute rien. pas sel,pas de poivre, pas de beurre...rien...pour 50 avant taxes, alcool et service, je vais aller faire mon epicerie et mon souper moimeme et me faire une grilled cheese de luxe et du foie de veau saute aux bacons...et il me restera encore de largent!
if you have a truck dont go here to get it washed. i bought their membership on special and have it till the end of july, but honestly i am not impressed with the car wash, all other car washers do a better job for my truck 2012 dodge ram i have gone through the car wash three times now, due to them being free, and every time it never washes the back window of my truck, leaves it filthy and spotted.  it also leaves water spots on my windshield both rearview mirrors and both windows on each side. when i called and spoke to a manager, he informed me that the car wash is not intended for trucks and therefore does not wash the back window the blow dryers at the end are horribly inefficient. bring a towel with you if you plan on using this car wash. ill keep going for the free washes until my membership is out, but then will be canceling and returning to my normal car wash. this car wash may work well for cars, but i would not recommend bringing your truck.
i assumed this place was open since the hours of operation posted on their website lists 7am7pm. it is 10:09am on monday, october 5th and i discovered, of course after i did a bug presoak on my car, that no one is here...after calling around i finally get ahold of someone and they tell me they must of had a no call no show. they will get someone in and open up in 45min. what or you kidding me? meanwhile my car has soap all over the front that has dried. this is not good business.. who hired these people?
the worst carwash ive ever been to in my entire life!!!!!paid 15 and my car came out so much worse than when it went in!!!! so disappointed i cannot believe that this place has 4 12 stars. unbelievable.
buyers sellers beware   i work   there and they  just ripped off   my client gibbons who  bought and paid for a 20 ft concession trailer   she placed on consignment there,  they sold it july 1st 2015 and kept  her  money  ,  then   owner paul  helbert said  he wired   her the funds  ,  well no  money  and no  proof  of paperwork   ever was  produced,they hung up on her when she called paul for  payment     buyers  and sellets   beware
i was a huge mmd fan for many years back in the day...now im gf and when they moved to 16th street i was so excited...i emailed to check if they had gf bread options and they responded right away that they did. soooo...when i went there today and asked for my sandwich on gf bread the staff looked at me like i was crazy, and the response was with a laugh no, we dont have any gluten free bread and the line workers all looked at each other and asked for the next persons order. i could have asked for a lettuce wrap or no bread at all, but felt they should have suggested it, instead they acted like i was wasting their time and the place was not busy at all.  so, their fb page gave me incorrect info and the staff is not well trained, i should have figured it would be that way by the age of the workers, but was really counting on the great food and service from back in the day.  sadly, those days are gone and i will go to a different deli.  bye bye miracle mile
dear josh,in response to your response, i do not consider my review of my experience a rant, as you referred to it. it is obvious from the tone of your words some misspelled that you are angry and misinformed.  my choice to not be a customer is based on my treatment at your operation and nothing more, i have no agenda and am insulted that you would insinuate that i do.  if you had 7 managers on duty that day...where were they? i saw 4 employees and nothing more, where to you hide your managers? also, if employees are trained correctly, you would never need 7 managers at one time...ever. the fact remains that i was lured in with false information, laughed at when i requested an item and then given excuses by you for all the so called misunderstandings and you continue to do so now.  george would be ashamed! and believe me that i am sad that my experience was so terrible, but i just cannot waste my time and energy on establishments that dont meet my expectations.  phoenix is full of great restaurants, and many have been around longer than yours, and have been functioning without 7 managers on duty, rude employees and misinformation. those are the restaurants i will frequent.  thank you again i thanked you already for your offer, but no thank you.
i hate to go against the popularity of this place. but i found it to be terrible. its basically cafeteria food but not in a good way.  if you loved school lunch, military food, or ever did a stint in jail where they tried to serve a hot meal then this is the place for you!! my wife wanted to try it so i thought i would play it safe and get a ham sandwich. i have no idea how they rang it up, but for basic ham sandwich with really high fat on the sliced cold holiday style ham, it came out to like 9 dollars. dont be in a hurry during lunch or dinner since its confusing to order, and their typical customers move slow and get confused easily.
really not a fan of this place. the bagels are overpriced and lower quality than youd get from a grocery store. ive tried a few different options and nothing was good. the salt bagel tasted more like blueberry, the everything bagel might as well be an onion bagel, and the cinnamon raisin bagels are basically a plain bagel with a faint hint of flavor. theyre dense and chewy. if these are fresh, they probably need to figure out a better plan because they seem stale compared to a truly fresh bagel.i wanted to like this place as its within walking distance of my house but there are quite a few options nearby that are better. they should probably just stick to coffee but thats overpriced and nothing special too.
what a disappointment!! the bagel man was closed so i came here as it was just down the street.  the cashier was horrible it seemed like i was an inconvenience.  they couldnt print a receipt and their credit card reader didnt work.  the bagels were waaaaaaaay over priced for a bacon egg and cheese bagel.  i almost walked out when i noticed the guy behind the counter making the eggs in the microwave!! my hunger pains and lack of time caused me to stay.   i havent taken my first bite and i already hate everything about this experience......ugh hopefully their food is not as shitty as their service or i am in for a horrible monday breakfast.update:  as expected the sandwich was horrible!!! there was enough pepper to kill a small child.  the egg tasted bland and the bagel was nothing to be excited about.  if i could give some negative stars i totally would.  what a waste of 5.14!!!
please hire additional staff so you can accomodate the lunchtime crowd. the line is unorganized and the one or two folks taking orders appear overwhelmed. also, they always run out of quiche and on a couple of occasions the soup dejour of the day was not ready  12:30 that is lunch time guys. get it together or close until you can serve your customers the right way.
very clean and of course the decor was beautiful and traditional for amelies. on the other hand, the line which was about seven people long took about fifteen minutes to get through which would have been acceptable if only one person was helping customers. however, there were five people helping. not one of them smiled, said hello, or even acknowledged me until i asked to order. she then said what do you want? so i asked when the cream puffs were made because they were clearly a day or two old and she proceeded to tell me they were made a couple hours ago. it also had a finger print in it. no thank you! a lot of the pastries were also mislabeled and there was not much left for being four hours from closing. i ordered a chocolate peanut butter petit four and had asked what was in it and she told me chocolate and peanut butter. oh thanks that clears things up! i was then ring up by the manager, who barely looked up from his screen except to ask for my money handed me a receipt and that was it... worst customer service ive had in a long time.
i was very excited to visit amelies but left with the thought that i will not return. paid top dollar for 2 pastries plus 2 caramel brownies. not a problem if they are out of this world. not. the lemon meringue tasted like something which could be bought at harris teeter. not a compliment. the caramel brownies were so sweet they were inedible according both my husband and me. i have visited the noda location once and had a good memory of their pastries but the fruit pastries on carmel rd location looked not fresh. shame on you amelies. all hopes for a decent bakery on the south side of town is gone.
last night was the first and last time i will ever eat at amelies. to start off, the staff were rude and very unfriendly. i ordered a cream puff that was nearly five dollars and have been throwing up all night due to food poisoning. if you ever visit this bakery, i highly suggest ordering an item that doesnt contain cream. harris teeter sells equal if not better deserts than amelies and i am sure they do not feed their customers spoiled food.
do you like friendly, professional, efficient service?  then this place is not for you!  do you like clean bathrooms?  this place is not for you. do you like staff that dress in exercise clothes like they just rolled in sweaty from the ymca to make your cafe au lait with a side of everlasting wait?  then yes, this is your place. maybe amelies is going for that sort of novelty place where people go because the service is poorlike dicks last resort to something like that. or...french people have a reputation for being rude, so maybe theyre just extending the french theme to the staffing and customer service aspects of the restaurant.come on people. it was such a nice thing to see a place with at least a little bit of character and creativity open in south charlottewe have so little funk down here. maybe that was why it was so much of a disappointment to have such a bad experience.  you have vast potentialyour decor and environment is really cool. you have decent and different food. your outdoor seating is nice. why have staff that doesnt care about customers or customer service?  be kind to your customers. get your processes in order so customers dont wait 20 minutes for a specialty coffee. be professional and look professional and take pride in what you do.  do that and people may actually want to come back.
wow!  having just moved to charlotte exactly a month ago, i wanted to try amelies with all the accolades it gets.  but, i was very disappointed.  the croissant was nothing special any local grocery store could have made it and it had sweet taste to it.  all of the chicken salad inside was rough, chewy chicken.  the side salad i got with the half sandwich was good and made with fresh greens and it tasted like homemade salad dressing.  i thought the iced tea had a light fruity taste and was fresh brewed.  but, this is what through me...the orange macaron.  it was frozen and i opened it to see what the yummy filling looked like.  there was a tiny plop and thats it :...posted the pic of my sad macaron under photos.
espresso was incredibly sour. quiche was still cold in the middle. staff was very friendly.
if you dont mind being tortured and disrespected, this is the place for you.
horrible experience. i dont normally write 1star reviews so take this with emphasis.i bought some wheels that turned out to be backordered. no problem, this happens and i was grateful a rep from ems called me and notified me it will be about a month delay.a month later, i am calling in to get a status update on my order. called during their business hours, and after 23 missed calls, my calls were being sent straight to voicemail. this was verified since i have multiple phone lines.i dont know how they do things in arizona, but this isnt customer service in the rest of the world. its shit. especially when a customers order is over 1,000 ... thats not a small sum of money for someone to part with.dont bother with this shop, go support another business who actually cares about customers and doesnt ignore them.if you still want to try it out, use paypal to buy so at least you can ask paypal for a refund if it doesnt work out.
the carding policy is very unclear. they very rudely kicked my friend out because she forgot her id, even though the doors say people below 21 are allowed before 10pm and even though i was here waiting for her. the beer list is impressive but so is old fashioneds.this is not the culture of wisconsin, where folks go out with their families and friends with under21 folks all the time.
went in a couple times now and both were bad. they card you at the door and then ask for an id with every drink. manager tried explaining that they have to do it because they have a lot of ins and outs?!? not quite sure what that means... they just built the place so if the number of doors are really that big of a deal then why didnt someone think of that?
the steak was ridiculously bad. chicken was ok. the salsa was so cold it made my whole taco seem like they pulled it out of the fridge. my 7 year old summed it up saying this tastes like poop!
called to get a quote. guy on phone was very rude. scheduled anyways. never showed. guess my experience wasnt quite a good as previous customer? we bought elsewhere.
you are correct david w. i am not a customer of yours and never will be. i was a potential customer of yours. as stated in my initial review. i called and scheduled an appt. with you, not your competitor w a close name, at the same time i took the whole day off work to meet you. you never even had the courtesy to call me and let me know you werent going to make it. guess i should of known better to even call someone advertising on craigslist. live and learn. what really boggles my mind at this point is a couple things. first contact made to me on this review was from kate w. her review goes into how great you are and even included multiple pictures. im asking myself while reading her response, how in the world could a customer contact me about a negative review on this company unless she actually works for or is affiliated in some way with this company? then david w owner of premium cabinets contacts me via email claiming to never of even talked to me? now a couple days later premium cabinets has two more 5 star reviews? neither one of which are from the phoenix metro area? owner of premium cabinets calls me out as a liar! wow!!! completely lies about scheduling me in, self posted positive reviews i believe, and calling me the liar. david w im guessing im not the only one that feels this way about your business practices. wonder how many more self reviews hell post. as i stated in my initial review, we went with a much better, professional company that does what they say theyre going to do. david w being in business myself for many years, this is not how you handle customers. i hope you learn this some day.
i bought about 6k worth of cabinetry from david in june and had his friend ray from montana install them. ray did a fairly good job but did not totally complete the install even though i paid him in full. he never returned to finish the job as promised many times. also the cabinets are now starting to have some quality and cracking issues and i have emailed david several times with no response. i have tried calling as well but his number is now non functional which probably means he is no longer in business.  i will be filing complaints with the bbb about both of these guys but to anyone considering a transaction with either one consider this post a fair warning!
its 5:30 on a saturday, the door was locked and i couldnt get in. ive heard good things about this place, but because its was closed when its posted that its open was a big inconvenience to me. i will definitely rethink taking time out of my day to visit this place again.

i have never been so offended by staff in a restaurant. the cook informed me that they were out of pulled pork then when i tried to order a burger they said they were out of burger meat. then they informed us that they were out of fries. my african american friend then was strait up refused service. i didnt know that this was the 1950s... dont come here..
they got my order wrong when i brought it up the guy he took it to the back pulled the old patty off and put it on a new bun. there was still mustard on the patty i didnt want mustard. jerk move. i have never had a restaurant pull that. i will never go back.
this place was my favorite place...... im a canadian, so being able to find poutine in the us was amazing. my husband and i had even drove from phoenix to tucson to visit that location multiple times. when they opened in tempe, we were so happy! weve visited this location many times. tonight, we decided to visit pretty late at night. about 3am. checked the hours on google, yelp and the website. all says they are open until 4am. when we arrived, the door was locked. the girl behind the counter motioned that they were closed, and when i showed her 4 fingers, motioning they close at 4... she showed me 3 fingers, laughed and walked away. so disappointed...i didnt see any change of hours on the windows, website, nowhere. we drove quite a distance even to this location, and had to drive back empty handed. the lack of updating on the website is disappointing, but the way the girl working treated us, even more disappointing.
tried the new place yesterday. we only have an hour for lunch, we sat for more than an hour and asked to make our order to go! the server was apologetic, it was not her fault! 20 minutes later we finally get our food, waited 10 minutes for someone to figure out our bill, we got up walk to the hostess when our server came to us and said because of our wait there was no charge. thanks!!!  i ordered the chicken sandwich, it was tasty but not worth the wait and parmesan fries were cold.  to the managers, if you cannot get folks served and out in an hour, youre doing something wrong!!
went here the day it opened on our lunch hour. luckily, we can take more than an hour without worry because it took a solid hour and a half. naturally, there are headaches to be expected with a brand new establishment but the entire experience was chaotic. we were helped by no less than four different servers. somehow they forgot to put our orders in and lost mine completely. kudos to the manager for comping our meal but somehow that still does not seem like enough. the burger i received had very few of the items i selected, was cooked well beyond what i asked and i received the incorrect fries. this place has a lot of potential being amidst so many office buildings and right off the light rail but they really need to be more organized. its going to be awhile before i feel like trying this place again.
well i would have reviewed their fold but we never actually got it. there were a group of 8 of us. we put in our order for drinks and food and an hour later got no food. our waiter never came back. after sitting there someone else came and asked us for our drink order again.....after we had already been sitting for an hour. we then ask for the manager and ask her what was going on with our order. she went to go find out and told us that our order had been put in 5 minutes ago. again we had been sitting waiting for an hour. the manager apologized was quite non challant about how long it took our food and we decided to leave. i will never eat here ever!!!!!!
i was there on saturday with a group of 8 friends and we never got water, drinks or food after being there for almost an hour. in fact as we were leaving the waiter screamed let them leave very classy. i have sent a letter to their corp office but i dont expect a reply.
for a 16 lunch... just one person.  a nothing special burger and fries.  i will never go back here and i will tell everyone i know to just to to 5 guys or in and out our mcdonalds.  what a rip off.  i had to put salt and hot sauce on the burger to make it taste like anything.  i have never done that to a burger from a restaurant.  terrible
you know things are bad, when you decide to download yelp just to explain how bad the service is. so far weve been seated for 30 mins. it took the first 15 to flag a server down. i have now spent 15 minutes waiting on my water and shake. the shake i can possibly understand...but water? not to mention we had to waive someone down. seriously this has been one of my worst experiences ever at a restaurant. whew, waived down someone and got water after only 35 mins.
a group of very friendly people, 6 of us, decided to swing in here to have a drink before heading to a concert. ordered a round of drinks when we were first seated, that never showed up. mitchel, our server, was a nice man. we were told the bartenders were behind. we could see them pretty much the whole time, and within 15 minutes half the place had cleared out.  after these first 15 minutes passed, another large group was seated. as our food was arriving, i asked the lady delivering food if she could check on our drinks. we ordered the drinks at 556 pm, it was now 627pm the bar is backed up... i looked over and the other party had their drinks already. the manager simply said there was nothing she could do... she said she would have made them herself if she could, which, as a veteran of the food industry, is exactly what she should have done... helped out the bar if they really were behind... i have never worked for a restauraunt that gave priority to anything but drinks... they usually have a higher profit margin than food, and you can serve them faster than food. i had already finished my food, so we asked them to simply cancel the drink order, as time was nearing for our concert. the hostess was extremely pleasant as well. however, they need a manager with something other than a title. the food tasted good, but was lukewarm. another table had gotten up and left, and they told us good luck, it was just taking too long... so sad. this place has good potential, and hoepfully someday i can try one of their counterballs!!
update to the previous review: after 45 minutes we had another server ask if we had been helped. after checking on status of the shake, he returned and asked what i had ordered because they hadnt entered it in the system. needless to say, this was the last straw. as we were leaving, we asked for the manager. i couldnt begin to tell you how insincere and could care less attitude she presented. you would think the restaurant was slammed busy, but we were seated promptly and a quick look around showed at least 20 im being generous, it was probably closer to 40 of the tables were empty.unfortunately i cant speak to their product, but if the level of service is any gauge, i would stay away until they change management or better train the staff...probably a combo of both.
should have heeded the long wait warnings. would love to try this place out again but lunch in under an hour isnt an unreasonable standard. place was maybe 60 filled and between 3 to 4 host and wait staff we gave up after waiting at our table for 30min before someone asked what happened to our food. unfortunately we werent the only ones. saw a few people speak to the manager so i assume it was a good day. lunch goers should avoid if time is important. the food did smell good but at those prices of hope for less than 45min dining experience.
1.5 hours at the restaurant with no burger. after waiting another 30 min after discussing the issue with the manager and still no food. wtf
an hour and 45 mins  still no food. we were told it would be a 15 min wait for a table. the restaurant was about 23rd full when we arrived. they said everyone came at once  the kitchen was slammed. theyre located near the convention center! thats what happens at lunch! the food was good but not worth the disorganization!
ive been to this place 3 times. two out of three i didnt get to eat there. pretty bad odds in my opinion. make sure you have a back up plan if you do try going. the first time, they had recently changed their hours and i showed up 15 minutes after the new closing. if you do decide to go here, i highly recommend calling ahead to make sure they will actually be open... that time, i spoke with the manager and he was actually very kind and professional. he offered me a burger on the house the next time. i thought id give them a second chance... he said that business was slow in the evenings, thats why they cut the hours. i went back, earlier this time, a couple days later, sat at the bar and enjoyed a great burger and a bananas foster milkshake that was pretty stellar. the bartender was really fun to chat with and service was good. so i thought they redeemed themselves and the first time was just a fluke and took my friend there for his birthday last night... problems again. they had a sign handwritten on the door that they were closed til 8 for a private party. but there were people sitting at the bar and the hostess said we could order at the bar. cool. thats what we wanted to do anyway. there was a couple guys on our right, not part of private party, eating. another couple on the left put in a food order just as we were deciding on drinks. a different bartender than the last time i was there made my drink then comes and tells us the manager says there will be no food orders for a while. its 7:12... we ask what time will food be available? the private party has ended early in the meantime and theyre clearing out. he says maybe 7:30 or 8, hes not sure. we were confused and asked to speak to the manager. he didnt logically explain why food couldnt be made, since the private party was done. i asked if the kitchen staff was on break? nope. were they out of food? nope. this acting manager javier also refused to provide any reason as to why the people next to us got served and we wouldnt be. the other couple whose order was actually taken canceled their order and decided to leave when we did. i dont know if their food was being cooked or not but the bartender had taken their order and didnt tell them that no food was being cooked so i have a sneaking suspicion if we waited a few more minutes their food would have shown up... that couple said that they had problems when they came here before too and heard other people they know say the same thing. i felt like the acting manager really didnt care about this place as a business. i asked him if he had any vested interest in the business or if the owner was on premises. he refused to answer. i asked for a business card. he said they dont have those, which i knew was a blatant lie, since i had that incident with the hours of operation the first time i came, the other manager had given me one then with the promise of a burger on the house. i dont even think this manager javier understood what a vested interest is. an owner manager would have found a way to accommodate patrons rather than alienating them, or at least made a genuine apology and offered something for the inconvenience. we even asked if we could just do a togo order. unfortunately, it doesnt seem that the manager here has any real business knowledge and the customer service skills of a string bean. the rest of the staff seemed to be intimidated and embarrassed by him. if i owned this place, id fire him on the spot. he was defensive and stubborn rather than recognizing in the span of 10 minutes he was losing 4 peoples business permanently. who knows how often he acts like this? id be willing to bet they have a high turnover rate on staff just from their reaction to what happened too us.  im sad to write this review because i actually like the idea of this restaurant but with a stubborn, unprofessional manager at the helm and inconsistent hours of operation, i will not waste my time trying to go there again. i feel bad for the staff there because they were all very nice and much more empathetic than the manager whos the one that is supposed to be setting the example for them.
went to grab a burger at the bar and watch the fsu game during my lunch break. sat for 10 minutes while the bar tender completely ignored me and talked to her friends at the bar. didnt even get a water...got up and walked out.
my husband and i just moved to phoenix from los angeles.  we would frequent the counter in marina del rey and love it.  so today, november 14, 2015 at 12:45 we wanted try out the one here in phoenix on central.  it was the worst experience i have ever had.  for starters, we sat at the bar and werent acknowledged for 5 minutes and it wasnt even busy! we finally get acknowledged by macy who now takes our drink order. ill be candid, i dont think she wanted to be there, no smile, was complaining, seemed miserable and my husband and i actually witnessed her tell a server, i dont think this is what was ordered, but give it to her and if she doesnt like it, i will take it off their bill.  so we finally place our order and my husband creates his own burger and i always get the blt with avocado and extra crispy bacon.  well our food arrives and its not crispy bacon.  i take it off the sandwich and tell macy that i asked for crispy bacon and she says oh, i forgot to put that in when i placed the order.  i replied with i would like to get what i ordered.  so she comes out with a plate of 3 pieces of bacon and apologizes and says im sorry, they are stingy back there and if i bring more they are going to want me to charge you extra for it.  i had this stunning look on my face like are you fing kidding me, its your mistake and i would have to pay extra. macy said that she took 25 off of our bill, but our bill came out to 30 something dollars and only .30 cents was taken off, but i left it alone and figured i would bring it here to yelp.  i couldnt believe the customer service that we received.  clearly the wrong person is behind the bar. she was not sociable and if john taffer was to ever go their he would rip macy a new one or even fire her.the kicker to this scenario is that before our food came out we witnessed a group of 3 men saying its not even busy in here, what is taking so damn long. turns out these guys came in for lunch on their lunch break and had been waiting for over 10 minutes to get their bill so they could go back to work.  one man finally got up and tracked the waitress down and said, we need our check, we have to get back to work.  they were clearly upset at the service they received considering the place was empty. one of the men ended up leaving her a note on the receipt, which i dont know what it said, but the waitress clearly thought it was funny! i can honestly say that management needs to step it up at this location and hopefully will be doing some serious customer service training soon.  i will not be going back anytime soon and am sad that i cant get my money back for this experience. oh and i wouldnt recommend  anyone else to go to this location either.
i have been here twice after checking the hours to make sure they were open and was unable to eat there both times. one time they just had a sign on the door saying they we closed after i got a large group together to go after an event i was running, and another time they were closed for a convention after i made a trip down from mesa to go. i have never had this happen anywhere else, but had it happen here twice. ive heard the food is good, but if i have to call and make sure they are open every time that i want a burger, ill just go to the burger joint at roosevelt square which is an amazing burger.
ill never go here again! dont play the jukebox cause the stupid bartender will skip your music if he doesnt like it. and has nothing to say other than its the bartenders choice. well guess what if you dont like the music playing take it off the jukebox! i payed money for that. terrible service for a local! this is prob why they keep changing names cause they suck. their pool tables are crooked and the sticks are warped hiding behind the buck hunter machine and if you wanna play darts youre in the way of the people playing pool. poor setup and crappy bar. like i said ill never step foot inside there again!
my girlfriend and i have been coming here for nearly 3 years every sunday to watch the eagles games. im considering going elsewhere. im currently sitting in the restaurant and have been here for over 40 minutes and havent been served anything, while other customers have entered the bar and been served. absolutely terrible service by the evening crew! get it together!
review based on servicehours. they have great juices, however, ive been to this location on two separate occasions to get juice in the morning before i started my day and they were not open when they should have been. this is very disappointing and makes me not want to patronize the business anymore. the first time this happened some time in august i arrived shortly after the 7am opening time, waited for over half an hour before i had to leave. i later found out there was a schedule mix up thus the reason they were late opening. the second time, which was today 106, i arrived at 8am an hour after scheduled opening and the location was closed again. i waited for about 10 minutes, watching a few other patrons drive up, walk up to the door only to realize they werent open.  i surely hope they can get the morning hours worked out.
a friend and i recently went, since we had a buy one get one coupon. thank goodness for the coupon as i would never pay 25 for four tacos and a couple drinks. the tacos were just so so, nothing special. the queso for the chips was nacho cheese. if you are thinking of going here id highly consider salsaritas heck even taco bell over this place. if i had to name a positive i guess id say the soda was good and cold? what a failure this place is.
first and last visit this evening.  i ordered one chicken enchilada and one cheese.  i choose the blackened chicken, as i was told that it had more seasoning.  both were cold and bland.  no flavor whatsoever  the meal came with tortilla chips.  they lacked crunch as well as flavor.  definitely not what i expect for texmex .  there was a hot sauce bar, but it was all bottled hot sauce, no fresh choices or salsa. there were tiny paper cups that held about a teaspoon of the sauce, definitely not user friendly for dipping.  after a few bites of cold flavorless food i left and headed over to chipolte.  for 0.10 cents more i soon was enjoying a fresh flavorful warm steak burrito.the store was very clean and the employees were all very friendly.
this was my first time eating at tijuana flats and it will probably be my last. i asked for a burrito bowl and the waiter said they do not have that, but they have nurrito bowls. thats fine, i get building your brand, but maybe without an attitude. i got my order to go. i asked for no beans since im allergic and i still got beans. i gave my food to my roommate when i got home.. at least she approved!
shady owner!!  my friend understands vietnamese and the owner told my lady to not clean my toe nails to save time. wtf?! thats my favorite part of getting a pedicure.  i kept on asking her are you going to clean my toes, she said after.  so she cleaned after putting gel on, how can you clean when you cant see?  it ended up hurting me.  so dumb!  in the end, it took her longer time.  i said, yes, if you have done it correctly, it would have been quicker.  basically, owner tried to cheat me and calling me crazy in vietnamese and my friend and i end up confronting both.  theres an awkward moment of silent now as i write this review.
if i could give negative stars i would.  went here and didnt even get 20 off of the services that they offered.  they will rip you off and service was terrible.
this place was a huge disappointment. everything is ala carte and over priced. no bbq sauce on the meat yet this is supposed to be a bbq place?? the meat was all fat and very little meat on the brisket sandwich..threw half of it away and went to mcdonalds!!!
one simple comment to the owner of frashers:  please go to little miss barbecue at 4301 east university drive in phoenix and try to do what they do.
well, wanted to check it out so went in for lunch. first off they were out of menus, next i ordered baby back ribs with side of slaw and corn. corn was brought out to table first??? then my lunch. ribs did fall off the bone but no flavor. i couldnt even tell what kind of smoke was used. didnt taste it at all. the slaw was shredded but it was as if they put water in it and that was it. my friend got the try tip and it was cut with the grain . the bbq sauce was bland and unremarkable.all in all a waste of time and money.the final straw for me is when you walk into a new place. dont hang up all your awards on your old place til you get it right with the current one! it makes you look silly. i was eating a pretty bad meal looking at all the best of phoenix awards and thinking well the other place is great been there but this sucks!l
been involved in barbecue in midwest for over 20 years so always looking to try a new barbecue place..  served for lunch at 11:45 and the place was about  12 full. first thing i noticed is everything is alcart and way over priced for lunch. they had no sampler platters and no combination meals so no real way to taste much. i ordered burn ends and they were out already. its 11:45 lunch rush hasnt even started.  so i went with the brisket and baby back ribs with a side of beans. 23.00 for lunch. when they brought it to me they forgot my ribs.. waitress said the probably gave them to someone else, so she grabbed an order from another waitress as she walked by the table. as for the sauce they had four to choose from; can only recommend the sweet.. others are way over spiced and take way from taste of the barbecue meat. as for the meat the brisket was cooked well, good smoke ring and tender but no flavor and very little rub. not worth the 7 for a sandwich. the beans were 3 for a half cup and was more like chili than backed beans.. if your  going to make baked beans in a bbq joint dont put hamburger in them and make them thin. then there was the ribs .. oh my! they were horrible... not done and very fatty! no flavor. not sure where they get their ribs but not impressed at all and being so underdone the fat didnt render out at all so it was like bitting into a cold piece of fat. i could not recommend this place to anyone who likes good barbecue at a fair price. sorry i wont be back
no!  dont do it. i dont want to write a negative review. ive been there twice now and it angers me. especially considering what i got for how much i paid. brisket is like pot roast w bbq sauce. it tastes like its cooked in an oven and not smoked or even grilled. no flavorno smoke ringgreasyflavorlessribs and sides are decent. all of the flavor is in the sauce, but the meat is just bad.  dont believe me, check out the smoke when you show up...oh wait there is none. they do have a side smoker but it looks like something i should have in my backyard. not a restaurant. also, very pricey for what you get. my thoughts. save your money or if you really need a fix try little miss. frashers sorry for the review but please take this as advice as i want to see you succeed. get some smoke and flavor on that meat. and work on your take out presentation. fatty brisket floating in grease in a styrofoam box is not appealing.
the food was greasy not well seasoned. the signature mayfair salad was tasteless. the prices are very inflated for lack of quality food.unfortunately this concept is not going fix the declining issue that was present at former fraser.
we eat at a lot of bar b q joints, and this one is the worst we have experienced, really!the servings were small, the side of beans and mac  cheese were extra small. you would think that for 30.00  our bill without drinks, we would have received ample servings, and large sides.the pulled pork was piled in a little pile and contained  many sorts of gristly black threads of something. the brisket was hard, chewy, and dry. the four tiny slices of bread were skimpy and ridiculous as well. so we received about 6.00 worth of food for 30.00.....
truly probably one of the worst experiences ever....you make reservations for attendance and upon arrival i was told that my party of two would have to be split up because of the group in attendance.  additionally the venue they use is much too small for the amount of people they allowed to attend rather than tell people they are booked and to schedule a different class.  it was cramped with people and tables too small to hold the canvas  supplies, as well as being a crusty smoky bar atmosphere.  additionally, absolute utter chaos broke out between two women in attendance a verbal arguement that was evolving into a physical fight like jerry springer and rather than call police or demand disruptive folks to leave, it was as if nothing was going on or happened.  my husband and i were absolutely appalled and our date night was ruined.....i will not recommend this business nor attend any other function at a different venue as it is clear they put these together to make the most money possible, with no real concern for the customers experience or comfort.  first bad experience utilizing groupon.101415....well as i do appreciate the fact you have responded to my review, it is now nearly 3 weeks later and the refund as promised has not been issued....
this is the second time i tried indian food. it took over an hour just to get my food, and the food was only ok. i wasnt really impressed at all. the waitress wasnt really communicating with us about the food either so that wasnt helpful. i definitely do not recommend this place.
really bad service! the wait time is like ages. having travelled all the way from ca to las vegas by road, we were very hungry . yelp had really good reviews for this place but now i wonder how?! its been atleast 40 mins since our order and there has been no sign of food! there is no coordination between the waiters! we got asked twice for order. the table beside us got their roti after they were done with their meal! i have no idea how their food tastes but their service sucks big time!if you are hungry and looking for quick food dont ever think of coming here!
generally disappointed. wings were pretty cheap, but small, many were broken, and a few of the sauces we tried were really bland. i was extremely disappointed that the wings didnt come with any ranch, blue cheese, or celery; each were an additional .50, not much, but those are things that should be standard inclusions... go to bww instead
wow!!! this is a disaster. when you walk in, you are not greeted and unsure where to go, since there is no hostess station, or signage as to where you should wait. the restaurant had only one other table, but numerous tables were dirty. we were in after 2pm, so the lunch rush had been gone for a while no excuse for all the dirty tables.  once we sat the server greeted us promptly, but after taking our order she never came back to check on our food or see if we needed refills. while we ate, i noticed how dirty everything was. if the front of house is this dirty, what does the kitchen look like???? the decor is blah, it looks like a middle schoolers room threw up on the walls. the food is nothing to write home about. the burger is grass fed beef, but there was no seasoning and it was extremely greasy. the boneless wings were small, the sauce was fine, but i am pretty sure they were straight out of a tyson bag. they were overprice and over processed. i will not revisit this place. so sad, with a little effort this place could have worked. p.s.tell your cook not to eat in plane sight of the customer. not sure why you wear latex gloves and feed your face. gross!
party of five, and we got the worst server in history.  got orders wrong,, didnt write anything  down. manager came over and picked a fight with my husband which was the wrong thing to do. food was okay. steaks cooked wrong and one person in our party got the wrong steak.  ordered bernaise sauce when we placed our order, had to ask 2 times for it and it came when the meal was over.  just a bad experience!  suggest a pen and paper for their waiters.
for starters there was all of 56 parties in the entire restaurant on a saturday eveningconcerning. ordered the 10 ounce filet and received a 67 ounce filet. server even noted that the filet was small, but management never stopped by the table to address the concern. knife had food on it and a drink that i ordered from the bar had string coming out of the top of the glass? restaurant is extremely over priced for the quality of food that is served. server was great, but unfortunately he had no support. i highly doubt this restaurant last more then 36 months. will never return or recommend to a local.
i usually come here for my late night fix but tonight was totally different! my friend ordered a paradise point and oh my god! was that disgusting!!! it literally tasted like they put half a banana and a ton of ice! it was terrible. there was even a disgusting after taste. never coming back! well, never coming back to the person who made my smoothie! so if you ever get james j watch out! i really wish i could give this place zero stars after this experience.
i  smoothies !! was so excited to see one on my side of town .,the service wasnt so good , but the lady was by her self .i ordered a smoothie and chicken chipotle sandwich , its was terrible drowning in chipotle sauce , couldnt even eat it took one bite and threw it away ..take a look at the photo maybe thats how they make them , didnt look anything like the picture.this was the first time i ordered a sandwich from a smoothie shop never again .,thanks for no lunch !! the smoothie was okay , cant complain, average.i never knew this place was here , the lady  waiting on me said its been here for five months , would of never known if i wasnt buying a new phone at tmobile ..i will probably come back and maybe have a better experience but i still will never order a sandwich ..we will see if my second experience is better then the first.as for now i give 1 star
this location cannot handle more than one car in the drive thru. just pulled up to the speaker to order and was told just a moment please waited almost 5 minutes while the cashier kept the headset on so i could hear the conversation. there was literally one car i front of us no one else. after 5 minutes of waiting to order again asked for help. was told again just a moment please this was going on 10 minutes of sitting there with no help at all. the location by my house has one. employee most nights and he multi tasks great and takes care of the customers very well. wont be back
went into this taco place awhile back because of the yelp reviews. i was very excited to try it out. went in and the employees were friendly. customer service is there. that all went away while waiting an hour plus for my order and being told that it took that long because they had a phone order. and having customers who ordered after me get their food before me. i honestly think they forgot my order and tried to cover it up by saying it took that long because of a phone order. food was ok. same as all the other cheap mexican places. the wait ruined my experience.
my coworker who usually shows zero emotion showed so much emotion and raved about how delicious the fried chicken was at blue ribbon on the strip, so i was stoked when this place opened! i really wanted to love this place since i love fried chicken, but the bf and i were sorely disappointed after eating there last night. the menu had plenty of options with tenders, boneless thighs, wings, sandwiches, salads, sides, 3 draft beers, and cane sugar sodas. we each decided to go with the 2 pc tender meal 9.75, a boneless thigh 3.75, and a cane sugar soda 2.75. the 2 pc tender meal came with a side of cole slaw and shoestring fries. each table was stocked with a variety of sauces: bahhhbq, chipotle honey, wasabi honey, habanero hot sauce their house hot sauce though personally i prefer buffalo, and... i feel like there was one more besides plain ketchup but i cant remember.we were pretty excited and did our fair share of taking pictures of our food were those ppl, i know before diving in. everything was alright  started with the fries which were pretty good, tenders had great breading and seasoning but were a little on the dry side in both orders, cole slaw was fresh and vinegary, and the ginger ale soda was refreshing. the seasoning on the chicken is already delicious itself so i didnt think there was much need for the sauces unless you were using the sauce to make the dry tenders more juicy. overall, the above mentioned were good though id swap out the tenders to try the wings.here comes the big disappointment and my primary reason for dropping it from a 3 star to a 1: our boneless fried chicken thigh was uncooked in the center!! it looked perfectly fried on the outside and we had started to peel off some of the chicken skin to eat and were excited because it was seasoned well and crispy, but upon tearing the thigh open we noticed the entire center was uncooked! thank goodness neither of us jumped the gun and bit straight into the chicken thigh. it would be understandable though still unacceptable if maybe a tiny bit of the chicken was undercooked, but we literally had an uncooked center. it took us a moment to process the raw chicken we were staring at before bringing it to the counter to show them. the cashier that helped us said sorry and said they would redo the 2 boneless thighs. a few mins later we got back up to ask when they would be done and requested it to go since we had lost our appetites already. the gentleman that spoke with us seemed to be one of the supervisors but showed less apologetic emotion than the cashier. meh. our thighs were finally ready and was brought to our table boxed up with fries, a bottle of their habanero hot sauce, and a chocolate shake. the manager im assuming apologized and was very courteous. it was nice of them to throw in the extras along with our new order of thighs, but it wasnt able to erase our disappointment. when we walked out, there was a guy standing outside texting that sorta looked like bruce bromberg? but maybe not... couldnt really tell because it was dark and he had glasses on. anyway, he said, sorry again guys. they pulled the wrong piece out of the fryer too early.  ah, so thats why... yikes?!?!maybe ill give this place another chance eventually, but definitely not for a really really long time. i understand they just opened and may experience hiccups, but what a rookie, gross, and dangerous mistake to make on chicken when youre a fried chicken restaurant. theres too many other dining options in downtown summerlin for them to risk making a mistake this big. overall service could improve to be more consistent from all employees. dining room was clean and had tvs. i recommend taking a close gander at your chicken to make sure its edible before consuming.
id give it less if i could. the chicken has very little flavor. the prices are ridiculous. a large side of mashed potatoes almost 9 isnt even two servings. the fries are also way to high priced. these are just potatoes. summerlin or not the prices are ridiculous and the chicken itself isnt worth buying even if the prices were reasonable. there are good places in downtown summerlin. this isnt one.
this place looks good but waaaaay overpriced.went in on july 4th, ordered 2 sandwiches, 1 order of fries and 2 fountain drinks.....over 31.00!!!!there isnt a chicken sandwich on the face of the earth thats worth 31.00. sorry.
overpriced, tasteless food! it seems like all reviews are fake. eg: fivestar review with the phrase, always cooked to perfection?! mediocre about covers it.
chicken was good, fries not so much..very expensive for what you get here and we will not be going back..
i was highly disappointed in the quality of the food. the bill was 50 and none of us had finished the food we ordered. i had ordered the dark meat, and felt that it was undercooked. the way the chicken was breaded and swamped in season salt was disgusting. the chicken coating was very reminiscent of checkin fried in pigskin. it literally looked like a huge pieces of that fried pig skin you buy at the gas station. they get one star for the good soda machine. please folks dont waste your money, summerlin prices  north las vegas quality...
disturbingly disgusting. chicken wings were so big and under cooked. there was no crunch to the fried chicken at all. way too many fries which taste nothing like potatoes. this place was over priced. the best thing they have is the soda machine.
yuck. honestly with worst chicken ive ever eaten.  had absolutely no taste.  what in the world is that breading supposed to be on the chicken strips?  who charges 10 for three chicken strips?  shake was more expensive than some locations on the strip.   expensive and tasteless.
i was so excited to try this place! i didnt read any reviews prior as not to sway my opinions or thoughts on this location prior to trying it. first this place is really expensive for what it is. 3 chicken tenders will cost you nearly 13! it does include fries but still pretty expensive! the chicken was really nothing special. it was ok but really pretty dry!the fries and chicken were both greasy and lacked seasoning. they have a few fun sauces to try but thats not enough to persuade me to return. if you want chicken fingers you are much better off at raising canes or even getting the tyson frozen chicken fingers from the grocery store. i was very disappointed and wont be returning.
never go to this place for the service. i had been there twice and every time they broke things right after i did my service there. i had to bring back my car for repair. i had spent over 1000 there for my first service and 2nd time they tried to overcharge me an unauthorized payment. too bad that they just lost a valuable customer like me who is willing to spend a lot for the car service.go to any local place to fix your car. you can receive not only a better service but also a more reasonable price too. brakes plus the one in gilbert can be considered.
i also had a pretty negative experience here. a few months after getting bent over on unnecessary upsells by camelback toyota and their shady service department, i decided to give big two a try since they had a brand new facility and were much more convenient in terms of their location. i brought my vehicle in for a standard oil change, and lo and behold, the service writer comes back to me with claims that i need to flush my fluids and have additional work performed. i told them absolutely not, just finish my oil change and thats all i have the time and money for today. he continued to try and talk me into these unnecessary additional services, unaware that id already fallen for that trick once at camelback, and there was absolutely no way my car required these bogus services again! only a few thousand miles later. these people are crooks, my guess would be that they adhere to these business practices to help pay for their nice, new facility...but quite frankly, im not gonna help you foot the bill for it by paying for imaginary services that i dont need.
how do i loathe thee, big two chandler service department?  let me count the ways...theres a special ring in hell where all the mechanics and sales people at this dealership belong. they are the lowest of the low. im talking thebullywhousedstealyourlunchmoneyingradeschool kind of low.  or the22yearoldloserwhoposedasahighschoolbasketballplayertogetchicks kind of low.  theyre so slimy id recommend wearing gloves to even view their website.my story:  im a toy girl through and through.  ever since i bought my first used tercel and jumped in rockin my cool side ponytail cmon, everyone has a bad early 90s haircut somewhere in their history, i was hooked.  good gas mileage, great resell value and they drive forever.  flash forward to this spring when the clutch finally started to go on my beloved tacoma. i asked around for service recommendations and a coworker mentioned big two as convenient, so i headed down to take a look.  admittedly, my skeptometer was a little elevated.  youve heard those radio ads.  what kind of customer would want a massage in a car lot?  wait, dont answer that.  but  i doubt that rearranging the feng shui of the parts department helps them find the right part cheaper.  from the moment i walked in, big twos service department tried every cheesed___ maneuver in the book.  they kept my keys with a promise of itll just be a few more minutes for more than an hour, tried to charge me 1200 for a 300 clutch job, then the service manager came out to explain how i really needed more than 200 in unauthorized repairs.  seriously guys... i may be a chick, but theres no effing way im paying 80 for an air filter.  the icing on the cake?  listening to michael boltons greatest hits not once, but twice, while waiting for the diagnostics to be completed.  makes you wanna throw up in your mouf a little just reading that, doesnt it?i quickly got the heck out of there and took my truck to another dealer.  two hours and only 200 later, i was back safely on the road.  bottom line:  never take your vehicle to big two.  what a bunch of crooks.
had an appt to have routine oil change done.  sticker in the window said the mileage to return for an oil change, the vehicle maintenance light was on, oil has been changed every 5ooo miles by big two since i leased this new 4runner from big two.  however this time, my wife was told nope, doesnt need an oil change  instead it is now every 10,000 miles.  my wife said ok but can you turn off the vehicle maintenance light?  service rep said no, then it wont come on when it needs an oil change next time.  what is this craziness? i looked at the last receipt for an oil change and it even says 5000 miles for the next change.   i now go to a non dealer certified toyota mechanic.  this mechanic has now discovered that my shocks are leaking oil, showed me the leaking oil, and its 1 month out of warrantly now.  fantastic.  my new mechanic who i have known for 5 years and takes care of my other cars, told me this should have been caught at least 1 year ago by big two.   1300 for 4  shocks available only from toyota.  i am so pissed off at big two.  will tell everyone i know how i got screwed.
this is a review of the service department. a little background on my past with big two toyota. i bought my scion tc from them in october of 2006 and have taken my car there ever since for all routine maintenance and servicing. i gladly paid the 60 to have my oil changed there just because they used to have the best customer service. as a matter of fact i had intended to purchase a new car in the next 6 months from them based off of the great experiences they have provided me in the last 6 years.then i took my car in for an oil change in january. what is usually a pleasant 2 hour long experience was stretched to almost 5 hours. five hours! for an oil change! i kept being told oh it will be 20 more minutes, 20 more minutes, 20 more minutes!. i told the guy that i had a doctors appointment  that i couldnt miss and was in noticeable pain from my kidney stone and he kept telling me its coming right out. needless to say i missed my doctors appointment and left big two severely disappointed. not only was i running way behind schedule but as i pulled out i noticed that my check engine light was on, but was in such a rush i had to leave. i had surgery the following monday which i almost had to postpone due to the missed consultation and was out of commission for 2 weeks. once i returned to work i remembered i had to take the car in to have it looked at. sadly it decided to die on me in the middle of the road literally right while i was on the phone with their service center. i had it towed to them and thought i would be in good hands.then i got the call. my alternator was bad and my battery was dead. i explained that the battery was 3 months old and shouldnt be having any issues. they wanted to charge me 200 for a new battery and i told them not to do anything to the car til i could get the battery. i called them the following monday and no one in the service department could give me any information on my car. at this point i was getting upset and started pricing other mechanics because i did not authorize the repair. the quotes i was getting were 300 less than the 750 big two quoted me. the following day i was finally able to get a hold of the service department and they told me my car was done and i could pick it up. i was furious! i came down the next day to get my car and was told they found out my battery was fine but still somehow charged me 750 for it anyways.1 week of no car, 750 down the drain, and zero empathy from the service department.this leads me to now... a week later? my check engine light is back on. autozone checked it out and you know what they found? my alternator is faulty. i called big two and they told me they couldnt see me for 4 days and it probably isnt the alternator cause autozone lies all the time about that stuff. the guy on the phone was rude, lacked empathy, and destroyed what little loyalty i had left for big two.i dreamed of buying a new frs or tacoma in october... now that plan has changed.
i had the worst experience with big two. few weeks ago, i had gotten a flat tire due to the road hazard. my car is about 10 months old. when i called toyota to find out if i had tire warranty cause i didnt remember. they transferred me to the service specialists because the front desk at services didnt know or has authority to see. so i waited on the phone on the side of the street for about 5 mins. when someone finally came on, they told me they have no idea so someone will call me later.i asked them 1. should go there to find out? no, we are booked...cant get you in. 2. how long should i wait? we dont know.3. so how would i know if im covered to get a new tire? im not sure, you can wait for their call....are you serious? am i supposed to wait on the side of the street for them to call me? they cant tell whether my platinum toyota care has tire warranty? why did i pay over 1200 to buy this nonexisting service?its been 10 days and i still did not receive a call.  i am seriously thinking about selling my car because of the service i received.
i setup a phone appointment to get my car detailed with thomas. during the call he asked me if i wanted to get inside and the outside of my car cleaned. i answered yes. i wrnt to the dealership to the dealership i dropped my car off. when i called to pay for the detail i was told it was 185.00 which was suprising. i expected to pay 85.00 which is what i paid before at another toyota dealership. the cashier put thomas on the phone to discuss why the cost was so high. he began to explain that it was because the cleaned the engine and other parts of the car. i explained that when he asked me if i wanted the inside and outside of my car cleaned i did not think he was talking about the engine. that i have had my car cleaned before and it was only 85.00. he then asked me where was it that i got it cleaned for 85.00. i told him the name of the other toyota dealership and he said he looked it up in the system and could not locate record of it. then he said he went over what was being done when i dropped of the car. i told him that this is not something he did and i walked him through our complete interaction where the only thing he said to me was when he asked me how many miles i have on my car. that if he would have told me this when i dropped my car off there is no way i would have agreed to the service. i do acknowledge that i should have read the paper i signed but there also needs to be more communication on the side of the dealership. i would recommend that anyone using this dealership make sure that when you sign the paper for service that it matches what you scheduled the service for.
took my car in for the free 24 mos. maintenance program....didnt have me on the scheduled appt even though i called for an appt time??? got the car back after my 3 hour oil change....now i know why it took so long, now my car steers to the right, never did before, and now my full wind shield washer fluid doesnt work....they walk the walk but dont talk the talk....lot of b.s.
i took my scion there for service and dropped it off at 8am with an appointment. it was supposed to be worked on right away and i didnt get a call from them until 430 pm saying there was about 2000 in work to be done. the list they gave me was bullshit because all the items they said were wrong were already replaced just months earlier from the dealer i bought it from. i told them that they were all done and the service writer told me that i was a lier because it was not showing on his computer....duh it was done by the dealer i bought it from and not a toyota dealer. the list they gave me was spark plugs, front and rear struts, front and rear brakes, tires, and a whole lot of other shit. they said the car was not repaired with genuine toyota parts so the repairs were no good. my only complaint was poor fuel economy and a rougher than usual ride. anyway i left without doing any work there and they had the car 2 days. the advisor called me a lier and said i dont know what i am talking about. kyb shocks and struts are better than oem !!!!!!!!never will go back there again and this is after i bought 3 cars from them. they called me to meet with the service manager to hear my concerns and when i took time from my very busy day to see him, i was told he was busy and couldnt meet. bullshit crooks and liers !!!!!!never go there and service your car, they are so nice when they sell the car and then treat you like you are stupid when you get service. no wonder they spent millions on the beautiful dealership, they are ripping off the customers and getting away with it. not me.
i just got a lube job for my scion for 89!  i. will never ever go here again! unbelievable!  they are a complete rip off!! never again !!!!
update absolutely  the most incompetent service department i have ever seen. i only have myself to blame for being dumb enough to go back there twice to have the service department do the exact  thing twice. truck was dropped off on friday night to do an oil change and to check the issue with the rear brakes. the rear brakes were originally done by this service department and i have had issues with them ever since. i have had the truck in before to address the brake issue now 3 different times. the very first time i also took the truck in to have the work redone was on a saturday. todays episode is an exact duplicate of what happened the first time. dropped off truck on a friday for a saturday  service appointment. the services department closes at 4 pm. todays appointment time was 7:40 am. no call on the status of the repair so at 2:30pm i start calling to check on the status knowing how there incompetent staff handles things and i need to light a fire under them to get answers before they close for the day and end up holding my truck hostage till monday. i get no answers and am transferred to my service advisors  voicemail. i leave the message that im checking the status of the truck and that i need the truck back today. in order to get to work on monday. no return call until 3:37. yes 23 minutes before they close i am assured it will be ready today and to head on down around 4. i am of course without a car to get there because mine is in the shop. i ask my wife who is out to go by before 4 to pick it up. a miscommunication on her part and i dont know if she will truly get there by 4pm to pay for and pick it up. she asks me to call and pay for the work over the phone as she didnt have her wallet. i call back and more run around. there phone system is horrible and they by the time i get the run around  its now after 4 pm and the person in florida who answers the  overflow calls tells me service is closed...... here we go again. they have dragged their feet again by waiting till the last minute to let me know what is going on and now someone 2500 miles away tells me they are closed. rage ensues on my end yet again because this is the identical scenario that played out the last time i took the truck in for the exact same thing that i am trying to get them to finally fix right yet again. the bottom line is little there is little or no response to customer questions as you cant get ahold of anyone on the phone or when you do they cant help you cause they are reading a script 2500 miles away in florida. the end result was my wife did get there after 4 and was able to pick up the truck  even though the service department was supposedly closed they compd me a oil change to  earn my business in the future. i spent litteraly hours calling reaptedely or being on hold. they dont have enough staff to handle the call and work volume and because of this they leave the customer guessing if they will ever get a call back with the status of their car. ive learned to never go back there they are just a truly incompetent bunch of people that truly dont care about their customers needs. i truly hope this keeps people away from these guys because i imagine since the same thing happened to me twice im not the only one that has had something like this happen to them.
we purchased two vehicles in february from big two after having an amazing experience working with our sales person. we do not live in the valley and made a trip up here just for this reason. he is the sole reason we purchase from here. we bought two xbs and purchased wheel upgrades on one and warranty on both. the wheels we purchased were not in stock. we made an appt for a few weeks later to have the wheels put on. the day we purchased the vehicles it was rainy and stormy. we drove back home in the rain. the next day, we noticed on the used xb that each wheel had curb damage and clear coat coming off. we called the service department to report this. we got a call that afternoon from the finance department that they lost one of our contracts. we had to drive back to the valley to resign documents. on the day of our appt for the new wheels, we worked with our assigned service advisor and he quoted us the time would be about 1.5 hours. we were there for nearly 4 hours. after 2 hours i began asking how much longer and he kept quoting me 10 min 20 min etc. nearly four hours later, he said, i cant apologize enough without ever really apologizing. after this incident, we sent a very lengthy email to the gm and never received any response or acknowledgement. it took us actually contacting toyota corporate to actually get any communication. in may we came back here to demonstrate the issue with the wheels. we had to make an appointment for july 3 for their wheel and tire technicians. upon arrival, the wheel and tire technicians reported that they would be unable to make the repairs and we essentially wasted a trip up here. this dealership has been nothing but one issue after the other since the purchase process. if it were not for the amazing sales person we had, i would not have done business with them ever. best of luck to anyone that chooses to do business here.
i brought in my 09 scion xb to replace the recall parts.. when it was finished i remember it was the service manager who drove the car out.. i notice there was a big dent in the front left fender, it was pushed in bad. i pointed it out and told him it wasnt there before i brought it in and can you fix it, he told me all i need to do is have someone push it out and itll go pop back in place... just before dark i got home, had someone try to pop it in place and it didnt go so well like he said still looks bad. im so disappointed in myself i shouldnt listen to him i should of have him take the car back and do it for me. now the car looks ugly thanks for that pushed in fender smh i will never go back for any service or recommend this location .
not happy with this store. dip my cone to were i cant see the ice cream thru dipping chocolate. ugh
they fruit isnt that great. everything is mushy. they say locally produced fruits and veggies, but what grows here locally, cacti? got some turkey meat from the deli, it quickly spoiled. the higher price it is now a burden and doesnt translate into their quality. i miss albertsons.
over priced!  cutting your employees should probably show you guys arent making any money. lower the prices!
yesterday evening came into store to get fried chicken. it was dinner time and they out only had a couple pieces of fried chicken. they did dropped some more but had to wait 15 minutes. i walked around and was amazed at the high prices?  wife says she will not shop will at this store will go to vons or walmart due to prices. i noticed the sale prices were most of time regular price?? positive note is you can park close to door because no one in shopping in the store and no lines at checkout.  deli personal were very helpful thank you.
i didnt like alvertosons workers especially a few casher because some of them are talking with coworker even some customer are waiting at the counter and some customer had ice cream and some frozen food.they wanted to go home as soon as possible,but they didnt care and keep talking more.so i hoped that that kind of worker were dismissed by a new manager.but i saw her again and all workers still there,i was surprised the reason of why alvertsons had business down and i decided not to buy at haggen every place in las vegas.i talked my friend and neighbor and they agreed with me.
this store was formerly an albertsons which was not a good value to start with.  haggens is ten times worse! this store is filthy , under stocked , and way over priced. there was maybe 10 people in the whole store, customers that is , and less employees. did anyone in management notice the smiths on boulder is packed full of people shopping? i dont think southern nevada is going to support this c graded store we wont be back.this store is a ripoff.
hate it! so overpriced..bring in  savalot! new supermarket opened on e charleston..awesome prices but far drive to shop. they are new and opening stores all over, hopefully thell replace haggens!!
has gone down hill really bad. only one lane open. areas empty not replenished. more expensive. done shopping here.  miss albertsons. 3.88 for 2 peaches. really? not even organic.
prices are beyond ridiculously high.  a good place for ebt users i suppose from what i hear.  no condiments for the fresh sandwiches.  several bread brands totally empty.  liquor and meats not affordable.  long lines due to layoffs.  great parking choices.  something needs to be done to stop the hemmoraging.  not the employees fault.  i feel bad for them.  bring back albertsons.
haggen bought my local location of albertsons brand stores. i was worried at first because im not big on change but i tried to stay open minded. i was a little at ease once i heard that the employees of albertsons were assured that their jobs and schedules were safe. haggen opened and i went. it was nice. they seem to be big on organics which was nice. well then everything went south. employees lost hours and jobs and the store was half stocked at best most of the time. now theyre closing. i havent had enough of an experience with haggen to judge them as a company. but i do know that the timeline of events at my local store were unnerving. to buy out albertsons just to close it is fine in itself. not ideal it fine. however, to promise people whos livelihoods were at stake that they would be fine just to close the store with no reason is ridiculous. fck haggen.
i am so glad this place is going out of business. every since they bought it from albertsons they have run this store into the ground. they closed the pharmacy permanently today at 5pm. when i came at 4pm to pick up my prescriptions they had already pulled from the shelves and now i dont have my meds.they are over priced, under stocked and just generally poorly managed. hopefully they will sell this location to a compent grocery store company.
they failed to deliver bridal flowers which were ordered and paid. when i called to ask where they were daniel told me they were on the way. it took another 10 minutes for him to admit that they had not even been made and it was 12 hour past when they were due. i requested a refund posted to the card i had charged the flowers to and they tried to keep 15 because i had cancelled the order?  because they had not yet been made, i was responsible for canceling them?  it was crazy. i demanded a full refund and guess what? i got disconnected. i called back, had to start over and got the same information. in all, i was on the phone for 45 minutes, got no flowers for the bride and may have gotten a full refund. what a runaround terrible business.
i ordered flowers for my dying mothers hospital room paying 80...a small bouquet of 10 carnations  in a cheep glass vase and bow were delivered. i tried contacting them and after 5 callsemails they finally concluded the bouquet met all quality and substitution standards. i say businesses should not take financial advantage of greiving families...i could have gotten a better arrangement from walnart for 10. please steer clear of this company unless you have money to waste, dont care about quality, or dont mind disappointing your ill or dying familyfriend.
ordered flowers online from avas flowers for a friend to be delivered 8515 before 2pm after placing order i called and confirmed the order over the phone customer representative told me order was in no problems there should be no problem with the oder bein delivered on time.  after 2pm no delivery called avas flowers no answer went to automated service for call back information.  later that afternoon get called back flowers not delivered there was a problem assured flowers would be delivered next day 1st thing.  8615 1:27 pm no flowers delivered after speaking to manager and her supervisor who displayed no customer service qualities would not cancel the delivery and would only say they will be delivered today. theyve already missed my special occasion theyve already upset me with numerous calls to get flowers delivered.  no one should have to go thru such hassle and insanity when making a purchase.  safe you self do not order from avas flowers!!!  order 2507524
really wanted to like this place, as we live downtown, and are always looking for good restaurants.  price point was right so we decided to try.  the decor is just ok, with an attempt to nod at the history, but it still had a cold, empty feeling to it.  they need a bit more drama, like adding some art on the blank white walls and i would also recommend the lower the heights of the deco lights in  the center of the room to help fill the void.   very nice table top  and menu, i wondered if they add tablecloths at dinner service... service was not great, in particular the hostessmaitre d.  no smiles, deshuvelled uniform, not remotely into doing this job. waitress was nice but not great.food was ok at best, i had the chicken n waffles, which was chicken fingers on a waffle.  the gravy was good but i dont think that was really maple syrup.   husbands eggs seemed ok but not great, and when he asked for toast, we were told it didnt say in the menu that it came with toast, but they would give us some anyway.   while i appreciate that they made this concession, i wonder who serves eggs without toast??dont order the cappuccino.  i am hoping they can pull it together, we love the el cortez and would like to have more reasons to enjoy.
they need to bring back the old coffee shop at el cortez. this last visit is the second time i have eaten at this restaurant; and i will never eat here again. both times the service has been terrible, the food has been mediocre and definitely overpriced, and this last trip my food was cold in the middle. for what they are charging for the new restaurant, the food is not worth it.
only one star because the hostess was nice. only stopped in because everything in old vegas was closed this was open.... a big mistake the menu was very lackluster and the waitress was incompetent and a complete b! when she didnt understand a question about the menu she would just tell u the name of the item your asking about... left without eating... like many others
staff is awesome and friendly, but the donuts were chewy and gummy as other people have mentioned. maybe too much gluten or maybe the fryer is too hot and browning the outside before the inside is cooked. we basically took one bite out of each doughnut and threw the rest in the trash.  hopefully, they learn how to make a doughnut soon. the flavors had potential to be really good. one positive note is the doughnuts were not greasy.
traveled 13 miles to born  glazed because my sister told me about this place. got there and it was closed without any reason or notice. we were within normal business hours. disappointed and therefor im leaving this review. even the sign on the door said theyll return at 7:50 and i assume its a.m. because the theyd be closed at that time in the p.m.  who closes up shop without notice? yelp said they were open too.
if you go to this donut shop. then i must call you a putz. they are terrible. oily greasy. and they dont carry cake donuts! horribly overpriced. better go a few doors away for a wonderful 40 massage.
today was my first time shopping here and i am very disappointed with the way the employees act they are very unprofessional loud, joking, carrying on personal conversion with each other their conversations were childish the employees seem to be a bunch of over grown children with no self discipline or acceptable customer service skills
as far as haggens food store goes, they can take their stores and go back to washington!! we have so many good stores here already to shop at!! their very over priced with almost all their item there, and i noticed that right off the bat, as i use to shop there when it was the old vons here in summerlin! their trying to set this up like wholefoods..lol and i rather shop at wholefoods then at this store, its not even near the quality of wholefoods!! their bread selection totally sucks, and their wine department is way over priced! and that deli, they call a deli, well it doesnt even look good! smith has a lot better selection! as far as they rave about those dang cinnamon rolls, well i tried them.. and let me tell you, not worth the money they are asking for! i guess they think they are laced with gold or something!! lol.. anyway, im just not impressed with them what so ever!! i will not even pick up milk or bread from this place at all even though its close by me! its just not worth it!
warning: check expiration dates.  i was so surprised to see lowfat anderson dairy milk on sale 3 days past its expiration date.  the nonfat was due to expire tomorrow.  there was not any fresher milk hiding behind it, either.when i mentioned it to the clerk checking me out, she was well aware of it and very apologetic.  she said they were short staffed.  really?  so short staffed for 3 days you cant take 10 minutes to grab a cart and pull the milk?  how fresh is your seafood?  or your meat?what about the poor fool that doesnt check expiration dates?  are you knowingly selling expired product to your customers?  yuck  huge turnoff.
so much more expensive than vons. everything is still set up the same, but just with haggen brands and jacked up prices. i miss vons so much!!!!
as a nw transplant, i was disappointed when i saw that the vons in my neighborhood was now a haggen. i wouldnt shop there when i lived in up north, and i wont shop there now. the store was completely dead on a weekday late afternoon right before dinner. i walked through the product dept. to check prices...omg. exorbitantly high prices on basic fruits and veggies. the meat was even worse. i paid 4 for a gallon of milk and we went out that night....probably cheaper than buying food to prepare a meal based on what i saw.
i had been wanting to try the store since they took over the vons store, today was the day. i managed to get two stops at the store in one trip, my first and last. the fact that the parking lot was a ghost town at 3 in the afternoon, should have been a hint.their prices are outrageously high, figure on paying 1.5 to 2.5 times as much for any item, compared to albertsons or smiths. comparing items on sale, they are still 1.25 to 2.0 times higher than albertsons or smiths on sale price. im talking exact same products, in both the above comparisons. this was true for the bakery, deli, produce, meat, etc, basically everything in the store is over priced for the las vegas market.i remember many years ago raleys came to town, they came from northern california and were charging northern california prices in las vegas, it didnt work then, it wont work now. by the time raleys realized they needed to lower their prices, it was too late, they had already lost their customer base. the las vegas stores closed. i expect the same thing to happen to haggen, if they dont address the problem immediately.they had fresh ground sausage on sale according to the flyer, i searched and could not find it, so i went to the meat counter rang the bell three times to no avail, called the store on my cell phone, line busy, finally found an employee, she got on the pa system, finally the butcher showed up, i asked where the sausage was and he explained that, i didnt make any. it was on sale a few weeks ago, it didnt sell very well, so i stopped making it. i believe in empowering employees, but this type of autonomy, where they can arbitrarily not make an item they are advertising, is not empowering the employee, its showing a complete lack of respect, consideration and concern for the customer.its been mentioned in other reviews, but i noticed the 2 days left on the milk this was a premium brand, their own brand had 11 days left, if i came back in 9 days their brand would probably only have 2 days left.i went to check out, there was only one line open, since there was less than a dozen customers in the store, it was more than enough. this was at 3:30 in the afternoon.in general this store is pathetic, as i said ive been planning to come here since the change back in june, but it appears at least this store is already in a death spiral. they came in with high prices and lost the customer base, no one is going to pay twice as much for the same food they can get at albertsons or smiths. they are so short staffed they cant keep the product fresh, maybe they cant afford staff due to loss of sales, due to high prices. and the staff they do have are over empowered to make decisions such as disregarding corporates decision on sales items.if you like to throw away money paying higher prices on questionably fresh product, this may be the store for you, its not for me, i wont be back. ill just sit back and watch the place implode under the incompetence.
really bummed that haggen has taken over the vons at this location.  vons prices were good, but this place has just about lost me as a customer, other than for quick stops  and using the pharmacy. the 99cent store a few doors down in the same shopping plaza  will give you better deals on food.  the vons club card was great, with specials you could load onto your card, like 3 off for 20 or more purchased, and other good deals.  haggen has no card, just their sales as marked on the tags, which arent great sales  a recent shopping trip there would have been at least 30 less had it been the regular vons, using the vons card.  . i agree with all the other posters here who feel that haggen better start getting their prices in line with reality or this store will not just be a ghost town, itll be gone due to lack of loyal customers.  theres too many other places for people in this city to shop.
i dont see how haggen can be saved. once you price yourself out of the market, people will not return.haggen blamed its mistakes on its pricing?if i would have been running the chain, i would have worked 24 hours a day until the pricing was corrected. to be honest, this would have never happened on my watch. walmart, vons, albertsons and smiths are always checking the competitions prices. these chains are adjusting prices every hour, of everyday. its called competition.as for haggen, they assumed the consumer would not notice.maybe haggen can promote the stores as ghost towns?.in the end, the store associates are the victims in this haggen mess.
this is the worst supermarket i have ever set foot in! high prices, bad service , moldy fruit and vegetables, expired products. i want vons back! wont set foot in a haggens again!
this is an update of my previous review.  haggen has now closed their pharmacy at this location, they transferred all customer accounts to the albertsons on craig rd, so this is yet another reason why this store has lost my business.  if things dont improve here, i wonder if the store can survive with their high prices and no pharmacy.
what a disaster. now the pharmacy is gone. prices are sky high. lack of inventory in certain departments. only one checkout is open during the day time hours. i used to love vons.now company in chapter 11 so that everybody that is owed money gets screwed. i hate people that declare bankruptcy, hurting those honest people that had faith in them. avoid them.
well, this is a first for me, an update of an update. just learned today that haggen will be closing all their vegas stores by end of november, so this store is history.  this company apparently way overexpanded and is now in bankruptcy.  this stupid store was only at the vons location for about a year!  and now theyre gone. so the question now is: what will take its place at this location?  stay tuned!  as soon as i know, ill update again! i hope its a store thatll stay put for more than....uh... a year?
floral department is a joke! nothing out everything is left in the back. the worst selection ever.
i am not surprised haggens had possibly the shortest life span of any grocery store chain i have ever seen. i will say that for going out of business goob prices are still about 20 higher than whole foods  and whole foods has organic.it is crazy to think that haggens goob prices are this bad. a box of quaker goed out granola bars are more expensive than whole foods organic granola bars.!grapes are 2.99lb for organic grapes at whole foods. haggens goob price for green nonorganic grapes  with the 10 discount  3.59lb.when going into the store with goob sales, i at least expected to walk out with a few decent deals. i walked out emptyhanded and saved money by going down the street to smiths  and stopping at whole foods for a few organiconly necessities.it has been made public that haggens is suing albertsons to get their money back from this purchase. if it was me, i could not see raising pricing from buying stores with already the highest prices vons and raising prices 27 would be albertsons fault.the prices were priced out as though we live in alaska and a 3 12 hour trip was needed to go grocery shopping. las vegas is not a remote area where price gouging is acceptable. maybe haggens was for the 1ers out there  but the 99 of the population will price search and look for quality.if the prices were slightly higher, but competitive and had a lot more organic choices, i could understand. this was price gouging. going out of business prices should not be more than the regular price of whole foods.i personally hope haggens management rots in a sack. very poor management.
i agree with the other reviewer. these sandwiches are all bread sprinkled with a small amount of meat. and i mean very little meat. i had the 12.50 shrimp poboy with a few sad and lonely shrimp. where are their shrimp friends!!! :  seriously though  not coming back here.you can go across the street to the restaurant called e.a.t. and their shrimp poboy is huge!
i went to poboys with friends. we ordered to go and walked nearby to eat. one friend mentioned that her poboy was on the cold side. i didnt think anything of it. she cut into the catfish and asked if anyone thought it looked undercooked to her. i didnt think much into her statement but was secretly relieved that she got the bad one and not i. next, i opened mine. sadly, i came to the same conclusion. the poboy was cold and clearly undercooked. it is alarming that we received two separate orders with under cooked catfish. im going to play it safe and stay away. i paid 12 for catfish and 4 for fries when i could pay 10 for both at lolas. theres no way i can go back or recommend after such an experience. i hope others have the opportunity to read before wasting your money, stomach, and time.
as an avid food lover and supporter of the growing dtlv small businesses, i had been eyeing this place since its construction! i only knew of one other place that served poboys so i had high hopes for this place.upon walking in, i was so charmed by the ambience and design of the restaurant. the place was colorful, eclectic and earthy. i could feel some of that southern charm emanating from the walls. the staff was friendly and accommodating and the place was pretty busy. i even got to meet the owner brandon who shared a charming story about how he built the custom tables in his own garage and how how he picked some of the wall designs for his ideas. but he expressed he was way more passionate about food than decor. that made me excited just thinking about how good the food must be!i finally got my food, took a bite and was sorely disappointed. now, i know a thing or two about catfish, having fished for them a few times and cooked it myself. biting into my catfish poboy i realized my fish wasnt cooked completely. deepfried catfish is meant to be light and flaky but what i bit into was chewy, rubbery and more like eating nigiri sushi! it was terrible not to mention flavorless. in order to spare my intestines, i had to pull out most of the uncooked fish from my sandwich leaving me with just bread which was subpar. the fries we ordered were also undercooked and not crispy! those arent fries those are soggy potatoes! my other friends also had undercooked fish and soggy fries. sad to say that looks can be deceiving. not to mention, the place was ridiculously overpriced. spare yourself and go to lolas instead for a delish poboy.
we went on a monday night 6:15. while the dining room was empty, we were told that they had no room for us by the hostess. she was a young, inexperienced hostess... she continued to try and explain that her computer tablet would not allow us to sit in the dining room because it would remove other reservations. so much for technology. i had asked for the manager, but the hostess was reluctant to get him. after getting back home, i called and asked to speak to the manager. he came to the phone and said that he had his rear dining room available and we could come back. i dont think so.the restaurant has lost a customer. this was not worth the inexperienced hostess hired in this supposedly ny establishment. maybe this is how ny city treats their customers but this will not be acceptable to the charlotte market.if you want to go, make a reservation! to be clear, i did not eat or drink here.
chef panda opened a few days ago i was a little excited because there isnt a lot of delivery for chinese in surprise. well thats where the excitement stopped so first there is no website and good luck trying to find a menu online. i ordered an american chinese staple general chicken because its a little hard to mess up or so i thought .the sauce was sour the batter on the chicken was soggy no flavor i said white meat i got dark and i asked for rice but no rice came.i also ordered pot stickers i dont know why they thought thickening hot and sour soup to make a dipping sauce was a good idea but thats what they gave me. so i called this place back let them know that i didnt get any rice. i also asked if they could remake my dish i asked for it spicy and asked if they could make my chicken crispy.he then tells me he doesnt fry the chicken and asks me how to make his chicken crispy smh he proceeds to tell me he will tell the cook to use less water so the chicken is crispy ? im guessing this place doesnt make their own chicken they get it in bags and steam it. stay away from this place it was terrible.
i placed an order for delivery in the amount of 30. we ordered teriyaki chicken, which was simply chicken tossed atop white rice and teriyaki sauce just poured on top and the other order was general tso chicken which was so soggy i thought they had dumped it in water before putting it on the plate. we also had 2 orders of crab puff which were burnt to an absolute crisp, i mean the edges were black! we also ordered 2 egg rolls which we never received, although we did get the egg roll sauce!! we ended up throwing the entire dinners 2of them along with the crab puffs in the trash! chicken mcnuggets taste better a and theyre pretty bad! i also ordered all white meat, but i believe it was that processed, stamped together chicken, so it all looks white! never, ever, ever, will i order from there again! ive never had such horrible chinese food in my life anywhere!
probably the worst chinese food ive ever had. very bland. the egg rolls are the size of a tootsie roll. the crab puffs are basically a deep fried tortilla chip. plenty of better options in surprise other than this place.
my wife and i just moved here and tried the closest chinese place. we got sesame chicken and egg rolls. the egg rolls were quite tasty, however they forgot to mention these were not typical egg rolls; these were about 3 inches long. the chicken was way over cooked. it was crunchy and did not go down well. there was also no sauce on the on the chicken. im not talking a little bit of sauce. it was crusted onto the chicken. we will not be going back here. the one bright spot was that it was delivered quite quickly.
so we went here for dinner tonight. we usually go out once a week and eat out so we were dining in. we were the only customers in the place so our food came out quickly and it was hot temperature wise  5 stars i had beef skewer which was really good 5 stars, i also had the spicey beef it was good but could have killed me employees please ask the chef if you do not know what comes with your food. this item had mushrooms which could have had serious health issues had i not seem them in the food! other than that the spicy beef was ok 3.5 stars the person who had the kung pao chicken said it was bland and the chicken rubbery 1 star and the other party got shrimp and noodles dont know how many stars but he wasnt complaining. ok restaurant owners go buy some silverware and plates and serving dishes and serving spoons. our food came out in a bunch of to go boxes. i was like  uh... we were going to eat here! they provided paper plates. problem is since there was no serving spoons we had to dump the contents onto a small paper plate. this was extremely messy and i think i spilled more sauce than i got onto my plate. also consider giving guests napkins they had them in the kitchen
disgusting. new place and we love asian food so we thought wed try this place out. mistake of epic proportion. crab angels  good. egg rolls  meh. ive had worse, ive had better. my husbands cashew chicken was completely tasteless and watery. his thought a turkey sandwich has more flavor. seriously, all we could taste was celery. my lemon chicken  omg nasty. there was gristle rolled up into these nasty little fried balls of crusty greasy lameness. i spent the next 48 hours in my bathroom thanks to chef panda. never, ever, again.
this review was actually for panda express not chef panda. dont know how that happened but my apologies.
i really want this restaurant to succeed bec this is the only chinese restaurant that delivers. but worst chinese food ive ever had in my life , i can cook better than this ,, waisted 44 , i ordered egg flower soup . shrimp chopseuy ,panda chow mein, and orange chicken. tasted very bland  no taste at all like , even with soy sauce , it taste bad never again
wanted quick carry out for dinner, decided on chef panda. not a wise decision! the mongolian beef was extremely bland and soupy,  the steamed rice was dry, and the fried rice only comes in one size large so you are forced to buy more then you really need. the young lady who took my order was very nice and courteous, and it only took a few minutes to get my food and take home. i really wouldnt recommend this place there are many more choices in surprise area for chinese food.
service a la clientele 0.avec un ami, on commande un cafe glace. on regle et puis a la reception du cafe, on voit que le barista nous a fait un cafe au lait glace. on signale que nous avions seulement demande un cafe et pas de lait. a priori pas de souci, le barista se remet derriere sa machine, sauf quau moment de nous le donner, il nous lance sans aucune gene 8 svp !. pardon ? depuis quand un client doit payer pour les erreurs du personnel ?!si jy retourne ? non.
not impressed at all.. in fact wish we didnt choose this one. crab ragoon  it had so much curry in it, thats all you could taste. the mongolian beef  flavor was there, but the beef was chewy! all in all  yuck!
what ever time they tell you doesnt matter. expect another 20 to 30 minutes just for a carryout order. last time i will be getting a carry out order and will only be ordering for delivery if i have an extra hour or two to spare.
been here 3 times and the only time it was a good experience was the first time. the second time i ordered was okay except for the small error in forgetting to add a flavor to the crust, easy to deal with, the pizza was good otherwise. just got home with my pizzas tonight and they were pretty much all wrong. flavored crusts on the completely wrong pizzas, one of the pizzas wasnt even the right crust type, no extra sauce on one of them. i just dont understand how hard it is to read. being a server myself, and also having worked at a pizza place before i know personally this is not a hard job. i dont know what the interview process is here, but clearly the expectations arent very high at all. i will not be giving them anymore business.
awful customer service. the pizza was horrible. order was wrong. the pizza looked like the delivery driver flipped his car all the way to deliver. dont even know what else to say...
i ordered pizza hut when a visiting friend friend mentioned it as a preference. i tried the pizza, wings, potato fries and brownie desert.each of the entrees was extremely salty and the desert was sub par to say the least. i did not care for the taste of any. i will happily continue to order dominos.
terrible experience. last two times they have messed order up and been late . today that forgot parts of my order didnt get it right and were late . tried to call them twice to tell them ... they hung up on me . must recognize my number and they knew they messed up. what a waste of money .
horrible! give me my old location back! ordered two pizzas and wings. they were 40 mins late and our order was wrong! asked for extra sauce and got next to none. the wings were overcooked too. everything was cold! we tried to call and fix things, but you get a national call center. once we were finally transferred, they would just hang up on us! no more pizza hut for us!so i lied... we went back. this time my wife went in the store to order. she ordered a chicken and spinach pizza with white sauce. these morons cooked the pizza and then threw uncooked spinach on top. this place is a joke!
2 thumbs down! i always do online ordering from other pizza places and never had a bad experience till now. they never got my pizza order right and on top of that i wasnt the only one they messed up other people before me that was picking there pizza up there orders were messed up too. all i can say is stay away from this place because obviously making pizza is rocket science and there not qualified! smdhfailbooo
this was one of the worst pupusa i have ever tasted. the place had a weird smell it. i knew i should of left when i saw no one was here for lunch.the waiter couldnt speak clearly and wasnt friendly there was no wow factor. the plate of food was served on a weird plate fish shapedthe pupusa was under cooked which is frightening since there was nobody else in the restaurant to eat lunch at a particular time. hate to see how the food turns out when is busy. if they cant make a simple cheese pupusa! dont try the rest of the food my opinion. really disappointed overalleven the menu look like an amateur hour.
so, hubby wanted to try them out. so we cruzzed around until they opened, low and behold they werent open yet. we stayed for about 30 more minutes and still no show. so we ended up eating thai food next door. hubby was sooo annoyed and disappointed. :
my friends and i were looking for a new place to have fun and sing some karaoke. this is not the place. the kjs are not even real djkjs, so the music and singers sound horrible. plus, the karaoke songs they have are really bad versions  you know, the unprofessional synthesizer kind of versions. the location is kind of scary as well. its a dark, rundown area which hasnt quite been developed yet. food was fair, but took a long time to come out. djs dont have a clue what to play, or how to adjust things. maybe a good place for trashykaraoke singing.
went to see if they had any liquid for my ecig and whoever was there was watching tv with someone on a couch and acted like i was bothering him by coming in and didnt have any knowledge about the products i was looking at. i asked what they were and if he knew if any of them were good and he just shrugged and said i dunno, i dont use that stuff. i understand if you dont personally use every item in your store, but you should at least be a little more knowledgable about the things you carry and maybe try and act a little more friendly in the future. i dont need sunshine and rainbows, but at least dont look annoyed that i just interrupted what you were doing.suffice to say, i wont be returning here.
i ended up moving over to gilbert recently and saw that there was a smoke shop. i dropped in because i had quit smoking and wanted a zero nicotine e cig to help me with kicking cigs. when i walked in i had a guy show me the e cigs. he told me the cartridge was non refillable after the first try, which was really odd. however, i figured i would buy one anyway since i can have two cartridges. well, they sold me a 16 cartridge that doesnt even fit my e cig. ridiculous that he blatantly lied to me. never coming here again.
very bad !!!   the one star was an accident. im sorry but do not buy any vapor smokes here. i had 3 and all kept filling with fluid and no warranty. they just key selling me stuff. go to arizona mills mall and look for a stand in the middle they stand behind their stuff. at least for me they did. i would recommend not being to cheap. you know how that goes.
waited 40 mins just for a table... got seated at the only table that was open the entire time we waited. took over an hour for food. our waitress forgot to put in 2 of our parties meals. never brought water, coffee, or checked in with our table for anything. service was terrible. the manager ended up filling our waters and correcting our orders... cool atmosphere too bad service was inadequate to say the least.... i would have given this place negative stars but yelp wont let me!
not sure where to begin here. awful service, drinks and experience. the bloody marys were like tomato juice and horseradish with no liquor. the gm says there was 12 ounces but i doubt it. the white sangria was watered down and awful. the fries were soggy and not cooked all the way.the service was even worse. took 45 minutes to get drinks after waiving down a manager, waitress never asked how we wanted burgers and came out wrong. i know this place is new but nothing stood out that will make me come back.
wow, i am still perplexed by the crappy service and food, we just experienced.lets start front the beginning. we had a reservation for 6 at 11:15. we were seated and all was good.it took 15 minutes for them to take our drink orders 20 minutes after that we got our drinks.another 5 minutes after drinks arrived to get glasses to drink our drinks as we ordered pitchers.then we were informed that there were no chimichanga for brunch at 11:30 right after they opened. then the drinks themselves:pitcher of sangria really watered down and way to much ice.bloody mary pitcher was just tomato juice and horseradish, one of the worst we have tasted. the food arrived not all together and items missing.when they brought out the 2 burgers they said med rare and well done.they never asked us how we wanted them cooked. i said none of us would order well done and we were not asked how we want them cooked.they took it back and then can back 30 seconds later and placed it down in the table. we cut into it, and it was the well done burger. we decided after all the f ups we would just deal wth it. we were tired of all the errors and we were hungry!the food itself was satisfactory nothing i would ever say i need to come back and eat again. then the bill came and  they charged one of the 3 cards twice.it was a total cluster and the food was just average with no seasoning. they need to get it together.we will never be back! this was the worst experience. not the worst food, but the worst experience.
it was our first visit to ocotillo and we went for dinner. although the food was pretty good, the dining room is unbelievably loud. the acoustics are bad concrete floor, concrete walls and a hard wood ceiling but part of the problem was they allowed a large, company party to take over half of the dining room. it was so loud we couldnt hear the waitress tell us about the menu. at one point one of them got up to give a toast to their group, so loud it stopped conversations for the rest of the diners in the room. at another point one of the women in the group kept screaming across the room to someone else in her party, josh! josh! josh! we complained about it and said the group really needed to be in a private room, steve the assistant manager was very rude and said they dont have a private room there so we should have asked for an outside table being december it was chilly, but reminded us that we could talk as loud as we wanted to as well. we asked him to just leave as he clearly didnt see our point. he then stood at our table and said we were the rudest people he had ever met and he had the right to refuse service to us as our 300 bill is being presented to us. ridiculous. the hostesses and wait staff was great but the management provided terrible customer service and doesnt seem ready to handle a dinner crowd.
its possible that ive had worse service somewhere, but cant remember where. it took about 15 minutes after being seated to flag down a waiter to get water and a menu  another ten to place a drink order, yet another 10 to find out that one of the ingredients for the holiday drink special was unavailable, so my companion said, thats ok just make it without that ingredient. it took another 5 minutes for me to find the manger, have the waiter return only to tell my friend that the bartender doesnt make the drink without the ingredient. the lunch took nearly 60 minutes to arrive.the food quality was very uneven. my soup was excellent, but my friends fish and chips order was flavorless and overcooked.very, very loud.
what a disappointment and waste of time.  i went for dinner. the dining room was so loud we had to yell to be heard. the beer i ordered was not available. the candle looked like it hadnt been lit in a week. it just stayed there, unlit. the bus boy had a very dirty rag hanging out of his back pocket. it was in my face and smeared across our table when he cleared dishes from the table next to us. the bread was boring, the pasta too al dente and the sauce watery. there is no salt and pepper on the table to even doctor the food. its hard describe the texture of the calamari, dry maybe over cooked just strange. my friend didnt care for his pasta with claims either. on a good note our waitress, i think nicole, was very good.
i will definitely not be returning to this location. id rather drive to the pineville matthews or the matthews location than come back here. i thought the university location was bad, but no this is the worst ive been to. they are super slow and unorganized. when i was finally able to order i asked for fresh lettuce because the corner of it left was old and brown. she said yes and went and got fresh lettuce then filled my bowl with the old lettuce and topped it off with a pinch of the fresh. ummmmmm scuse me! theres a reason i asked for fresh lettuce!! once they finally got that together, making my way down the line these people dont even give you a full spoonful of stuff. i was constantly asking for more. even with the beans. ive never been to a location thats stingy with the beans. can i at least get a full spoon please. they dont bother to drain the beans or mild salsa. then the cheese she literally gave me a pinch with the tips of her fingers that sat in the middle of my salad as if it was just a garnish. i then had to ask for a handful at which point she gave me another pinch. by this time i was just staring at her annoyed and she finally got the point and gave me some cheese. we stood there for a moment as they scrambled to make togo orders constantly coming from the back and reaching over peoples food. one guy eventually asked for a lid. then sat down and ate his bowl inside. my bowl was so watery that it leaked through the bowl. i had to scoop my salad on a plate to eat it. left in the bowl was a big puddle of fluids. i dont know whats going on with this location but if you want a decent bowl drive to a different location. i understand that they just opened so i tried to go in with an open mind. but ive visited other new locations and they were never even close to this bad.
i keep trying to love this place because it was a daily staple for me back in ca...always the answer.  but this chipotle with blasting music and sloppy delivery is not the same.  i have come 3 more times, trying something different each time hoping i can get back to that special place with chipotle.  each time the meat tastes as if they spilled the seasoning on it.  and they make little football shaped burritos that they rip each time and then offer to double wrap it with an additional tortilla.  i want an unripped burrito shaped burrito that tastes like the chipotle i am used to.  please!!!
this is our fourth attempt to eat here and they still cant get it right. place is always filthy and out of everything. the employees just shrug their shoulders when you ask for something. management is obviously lacking here and it shows.
service was terrible. stood at the register for 5 minutes before someone came up to greet me. on top of that i got sick from the burrito bowl i ate. will never eat at chipotle again.
not for me. i didnt like the food at all. and the portions are teeny tiny. tried it and didnt like it. moving on ..
was unpleasantly surprised when i visited my vons supermarket and discovered  it had been taken over by haggen.  i hated the new store the minute i stepped foot inside.  they destroyed the floral department that i loved by removing all of the beautiful floral arrangements that vons had sold.  nearly all of the items i went to vons specifically for, were gone.  my family loved vons baked brownies which have been eliminated and replaced by some nasty little round things that tasted terrible.  no more discounts and my bill was 70 more than i normally spent at vons for the same type of products.   btw...all of the organic meat selections were gone and the organic produce, which didnt even include organic flat leaf parsley, looked exactly like the nonorganic produce  with an organic sticker on it, which raised my suspicions.  i will not be returning to this nasty store.  will have to go to sprouts and smiths from now on.
high prices, poor selection and uninviting in general.
my husband insisted on going opening day around 10 p.m., they opened at 4 and there was none of the opening day fanfare you would expect. it was tough to even locate an employee. can i be both underwhelmed and nonplussed? yes, thanks haggen. there was a lot of empty space in this store. i liked it much better when it was vons. food is more expensive than vons and albertsons which are outrageous! two bags of groceries were 90.00! i protested then decided to let my deranged husband make the purchase so i could rub it in when he was starving after exceeding the grocery budget. i felt violated by the outrageous prices. i had a colonoscopy that hurt less. we shant darken the door in that establishment ever again. kiss my cash goodbye suckas! im going back to trader joes, sprouts, and if im desperate for something in the wee hours, fresh and easy.
so unhappy that this was changed to haggen...you need to hand it back to vons!!!!!i went in and needed crystal geyser 1 gallon bottled water. there was only one on the shelf.when i went to check out, i asked the cashier if they had any more....she just gave me a look did not even attempt to ask someone in the back to check and said no.very poor, poor customer service and i am going to tell everyone i know not to shop at haggen.you just lost a good customer as i average 500.00 per month on groceries! horrible
what a joke! half of the food was expired, way too expensive, and the employees are smoking at the front door as i write this!! no wonder your store is always empty...we definitely will not be back.
i stopped here on the way home to see what it was like.  now i have and i wont be back.  this is a very large supermarket that should be a wegmans.  i was looking for three items and to check out the new store that used to be vons.  what i found was a very overpriced selection of groceries.  i got one of the three items i came for.  the deli section is anemic at best.  as i walked around, i saw 2 litre soda on sale marked down to 1.79 from 1.97.  i can go to a dollar store and get the same thing.  why on earth would i take such a sale?finally, it took more time to check out than it shoudl given the very few customers in the store and there was only one register open.i can see the for lease sign on the building now.come west wegmans, come west!
i joined yelp just so i could post this review.  if i could give less than 1 star, i would.  in my opinion, haggen is a big miss.  unless i have to go there in a pinch for a pharmaceutical item, i wont be back.  today i spent for lunch 1.59 for one baked chicken leg, 1.99 for one baked chicken breast and 3.40 for cucumber and onion salad  seriously???  on a previous visit, an employee was sitting in the aisle going through expired snacks, opening the bags and sharing them with a coworker.  surreal.  whole foods here i come for lunch  permanently...
sorry to say, the service and selection has gone down hill dramatically. rumor has it that haggen is giving this store up. if so, it shows. it could have been great, but its clear they are no longer interested in serving customers or providing a decent selection. couple that with high prices and why should i come back? i hope vons takes this store back. they were fantastic and know how to run a grocery store.
went to check out the market on the way home. it is like a cleaned up vons  bright well lit and free of all the tall fixtures. nice i like looking from one end of the produce area to the other. what i did not like was the customer service. it was awful . they made an error on my transaction and all they can do is say sorry we are not allowed to give refunds you will have to come back in the morning. icing on the cake was manager maryann saying thank you thank you thank you as i walked out the store. first impressions count with me. treat me rudely and i will just not return. there are many other places that appreciate their customers and want our business and are willing to correct their errors immediately. shame on haggens.
poor service, and its basically vons but way too expensive. 6 per pound of chicken breast, seriously?!
overall, i am very disappointed. the vons they took over at village center looks a bit barren. the prices are 1520 higher for most items and the grocery selection isnt really an improvement in many cases it is diminished.. if this vons had to go because of the merger, i wish glaziers could have opened a new location. i think it would have been a much better fit.
barren looking, not adequately  stocked. very expensive also. not going back as there are other much better choices. i also wish glaziers had opened in one of the locations.
no organic eggs, no organic veggies, bad yogurt, bad meat... i would have thought the point of haggen taking over for vons was to make better. we already loved the organic options and nonorganic options but now we have to find another grocery store after taking 4 years to find the right place. thanks haggen!
if i could do zero stars i would. my question is how can this place have produce worse than vons and charge 2 times as much. they ruined my dinner tonight because im not driving over there again at 110 degrees outside.
ive been to haggens three times since they opened. each time i bought much less than planned because of the sky high prices.  the  only area i found as an improvement over vons was the seafood. even there, i had to scold the clerk for trying to give me old chewed up seafood when there was obviously much better and fresher product in the display case.  the only people benefitting from haggens is smiths. they are getting all the money i used to spend at vons.
actually would score it 0 stars but unable to on site.  was a vonss shopper 12 timeswk. since it opened in the trails but will no longer shop at the new haggen unless it is a dire emergency since i live just up the street.  prices are about 13 higher than vons  other competitors, sale items in advertised flyers are merely higher or regular prices elsewhere, bakery items are scarce  look dry  unappealing besides being pricier, produce  bakery has all been significantly reduced  sparse, everything else looks similar with brighter lighting and much higher prices, less selection and poor customer service despite several employees just hanging around the service desk talking  laughing with each other.  i had asked for a raincheck for the single item i came in for  it was a major ordeal for the manager to issue it despite them being out of it.  no grand opening hooplaor anything to welcome customers to its new stores in new communities.  what a total disappointment!  will be counting the days, along with everyone i know who used to shop at vons  has been to haggen, until the store is hopefully acquired again by a company that cares about the shopping experience, competitiveness and its customers.  haggen has now lost many loyal vons customers and the smith aisles are bumpercarts where customer service reigns supreme!
the prices are ridiculously higher! not much variety on the shelves.  have now switched to smiths which is ultimately the winner. i will only shop here if i need to pick up 1 or 2 things.  cant wait until it either goes belly up or is purchased by a chain who is not looking to rip off the customer. kroger, look into purchasing this location, you will make even more of a killing in summerlin!
all i can say is wow! the only reason to go here is to go to the starbucks! otherwise drive 5 minutes the other way and hit smiths for better prices! extremely over priced for everything! i would rather deal with all the senior citizens and crazy parking lot at smiths then shop way overpriced food! this is the only place to grab one item if your in a binned. otherwise stay away!!!!  my entire family as well as neighborhood all started going to smiths now. this place is horrible! save your money and go somewhere else.
this was supposed to be an upgrade from vons, yet  nobody seems happy, employees or customers. there is not much selection and whatever is available is far too over priced! a bit sad and disappointed.
terrible! id like my vons back please. almost everything in the store is priced more than the old vons prices. service is slow and, as other reviewers have said, the employees dont seem to be happy to be working there at all. im generally not a complainer, but ive given them 56 chances and i still remain unimpressed. unfortunately, ill have to plan ahead better and go to smiths or sprouts, because at this point i cant see any reason to return to haggen unless it is an emergency. sorry to let my local grocery store go, but very poor showing.
i miss the old vons! this place is more expensive and their steaks are horrible. the steaks are supposed to be usda prime but definitely dont taste like they are. theyre tough and very overpriced
i miss vons!  the prices are exorbitant in some cases, almost 100 more than some stores  grape nuts at 4.49, whereas nutty nuggets at smiths is 2.29; 40 calorie popsicles are 1.99, whereas at smiths theyre 1.00 or 1.25 depending on the week.  ill never go back. instead, i now to go to vons on durango and desert inn as part of the shopping routine.  so, goodbye haggen and hello hassle.
if i could give zero stars i would. i shopped at the vons at this location for 15 years. i have been to the new store, haggen, three times and i am sad to say im going to have to start shopping elsewhere. the prices are ridiculously high, they are understocked, they dont have many of the items that i shopped for on a regular basis, the bakery section is awful  lacking in choices and dirty, and the steaks had brown spots on them today. this is a really sad change for our community.
hate, hate, hate this store.  i am so upset that haggen grocery store took over all of the vons stores in my neighborhood.  the prices are astronomical, the selection is horrible and many of the items i went specifically to vons to buy are gone.  i was forced to go to haggen today as i was running late to a dinner party and it was the nearest grocery store.  i went in to buy a couple of bottles of wine to take to give to the hostess and prices were insane, 54.00 for a bottle of mediocre california cabernet.  then i discovered they had no gift bags to fit a wine bottle.  vons used to have gift bags and tags and ribbons right in the alcohol section, which was convenient and made sense.  no such luck with haggen, they had removed the gift bags from the liquor section and had no bags to fit a bottle of wine in their cards and gift wrap section.  i had to go to another store!!  i will never return to this horrible store.
i will make this short  sweet as all the other negative reviews represent my opinion and more.  i have gone to the vons store for 13 yrs, live nearby the village center store and wanted this to be a great improvement over vons, however, am very disappointed, the place is now like a ghost town, prices are too much to swallow, and every time i go back, no one is shopping there anymore.....all my friends are now going elsewhere, and unfortunately i will be doing the same...yes, if i could give 0 stars, i would
like everyone else, i would give this a zero. treat it as a 711, go there only when desperate. youll pay for it. i have been a loyal vons shopper for over 15 years. i am now driving to the centennial walmart. by the way just down the road from walmart on skypointe is a great vons!!! i love their chocolate croissants. i dont know anyone who is shopping at haggens, i see a lot of old friends at vons skypointe.
i really tried to like this new store but ive been coming for a month and it just keeps getting worse.   most of the products that i really liked when it was vons are now gone.   no fresh glutenfree bread.  very limited selection in the frozen case.   tonight i went in for my favorite organic popcorn.   nope.  dont carry it anymore.   whole shelf is microwave everything.   something i bought today was about 2 more per bottle than what i was charged by vons.  the prices are outrageous.   the produce was good at first but has seriously declined in quality and quantity.   ill be going back to whole foods and looking to see if there are any vons stores left in las vegas and how far ill have to travel to get to one.
update: reported on september 25, 2015, pending approval by the us bankruptcy court, haggens will be closing all nv stores within the next year.  it was only a matter of time.once upon a time we have a great vons location here in summerlin where summerliners happily shopped.  apparently haggens thought they could buy a bunch of vons locations, slap green signs everywhere, and charge whole foods prices for either the same or inferior products.  well, it looks like they were wrong.  anyone who regularly shopped here when it was vons would know that the location,while not as busy as some grocery stores in town which was a good thing, would immediately notice that this store is nearly empty all the time. what a shame.  bring our vons back!a simple google search revealed this is not the only location enjoying the same rate of success: http:www.seattletimes.combusinessretailhaggencutsworkerhoursinseattlearea
i used to love this place when it was a vons  reasonable quality at reasonable prices. this place charges whole foods prices without the same quality. i have to be careful what i grab at this store because the most unexpected things will be way overpriced and i dont notice until i look at my receipt. i will not be shopping here any longer.
i have been a loyal customer of vons at this location for 14 years. change the name and increase the prices by 35? really? albertsons and smiths will get more regular business and the people already loyal to whole foods and trader joes stay there. i miss vons and refuse to pay the ridiculous prices offered here. i am voting with my feet and will not be back until vons buys the location back.
i agree that the prices are ridiculous and only go now to pharmacy only because i like the employees but they are some days struggling with the restrictions.  cant even get a shingles shot now.  extremely disappointed and loved vons.
one star is being generous. this store has a very limited selection in most of their departments. the only saving factor would be their produce, if you dont mind paying ridiculously high prices. at least 30 higher then when it was a vons. i asked the manager onduty, i want to say his name was doug, if he could get back a product was was no longer available after the change from vons, and he promised to look into it, but 6 weeks later...nothing. to bad that in an upscale neighborhood such as summerlin, we have such a substandard store as haggen. its worth the drive to alberstsons at charlestontown center.
lines are super long with not enough cashiers; even vons employed more than 2 during peak hours!  i shopped at the vons every weekits the same layout but less options.  the premade specialty salads look good but they all taste bad.  i now buy my meals from fresh and easy and the smiths on charleston, which has amazing options and they manage it correctly.  very disappointed because this store is so close to my house.
large selection of produce..a little pricey. store was kinda empty. had to take my daughter to ladies room..was filthy. not a good impression.
i miss vons! ive shopped at vons since i was a newlywed.. i used to thoroughly enjoy my vons club... and the feeling of being at vons. it is always empty now... and the prices are ridiculous!5 for a quart of half and half??!  and some of my favorite goto products are missing...looks like trader joes just got all of my business!
there is not much to add about their overpricing.  the word is out all around summerlin that this store is to be avoided.  the part that is disheartening is that they have such a nice location and potential.the fact their management has not responded to the reviews here, or the fact that the store is a ghost town does not bode well for the immediate future.
one star is too high.ive shopped at vons at the trails in summerlin since it opened.....spent thousands and thousands of dollars there over the years.  its only a few blocks from my house.  then haggens comes in june....high prices, many of my favorite items discontinued, and produce thats rock hard.  longtime employees say it will get better, so i wait.  most of my neighbors quit shopping there during the summer.so, recently, the shelves are almost bare.  but, today, i go in and its the last straw....theres no bread....no bread!  maybe half a dozen loafs and couple packages of buns.  when questioned, the girl in the department says theyre just waiting for a bread truck.  another gentleman and i laugh and comment that this is crazy.....theres hardly anything in the whole store!  she responds rudely so i decide to speak to a manager.i wait and i wait, and i wait......cory is called 3 times and is in the back of the store.....cant be bothered to come to the front and talk to me, so i leave.  this is the same cory who was offended when i suggested they have someone working in the meat department on saturdays so people could get meat from the meat counter.the most disappointing thing was that long time employees, whom ive known for years, did not seem to care that the stores condition was so unacceptable....cory certainly didnt care if he lost a longtime customer.  i left and drove to smiths.....i wont step foot in that store again.
this haggen is awful and overpriced. i just paid 10 for a watermelon stupid, i know to come find out thats its all rotten inside. i wonder how long its been sitting on a shelf. well, at least im gonna get my money back later today when i return in. please bring back vons. this place royally sucks!p.s. the only chilled white wine they have is chardonnay. seriously people? some of us prefer to drink pinot grigio and sauvignon blanc!!!update: i returned my watermelon and got money back. however, the guy who packs bags at the register, made sure to tell me to check the watermelon for hardness next time to avoid getting a bad one. really??!!! how about haggen checks their produce section for rotting products next time? what a joke this place is!
watch out for rising prices! you might hurt yourself trying to buy hamburgerhot buns  english muffins at 4.79 but were under 3 previously. pop that was 4.99 now almost 7.00. they close november 24th. presumably taking their inventory with them.
if i could give 0 stars i would.  haggen destroyed the local supermarket in summerlin.   when they took over, there was no announcement and most of the employees lost their jobs.   prices went up, quality down and you go in there now and shelves arent stocked.   i went in for water to find none stocked except haggen.  i will not support this company or any spinoffs of it based on what theyve done.
wrote the first review four months ago. did not return except once and the grave stocking manager sonny greeted me warmly and really tried to convince me to return . what is wrong with corporations who come in spend four months here and close. shame on you haggens for not putting in the effort! you took the number one grossing store at vons and turned it into a ghost town your management with the exception of sonny who is exceptional stinks. the pricing structure is insane this is an organization who wrote the book on how not to succeed in business.
haggens is a company, that believes in growth, potential. the haggens company from pacific northwest is based in washington state also ceo of starbucks...originally a mom and pops type business they were bought out...of course for monetary purpose. however with new management, they decided to expand out of their comfort zone, which is a great thing! however, they did it so quick. they bought a lot of albertsons and vons in nevada and california. they bought a lot so fast at a short time, that they went bankrupt and have to close a lot of stores down. so within months, they were already a failure waiting to happen. the location at this place used to be vons. prices were already higher than leading competition such as smiths  albertsons, but to add insult with the buy out...haggens did not key into saving consumers and customer satisfaction.  vons had high prices but kept value all around and kept customers still shopping. haggens was greedy and wanted more. now management is just as important, but am sure corporate had much more to do with the failure of this grocery chain to thrive in such a beautiful heart location of summerlin. recently the store is closing down shop. it is sad to see it fail, but it was brought on themselves. hope they bring back vons or even better a smiths or albertsons.
well, im not one for bad reviews but this is kind of a must. weve been here twice and got our order wrong both times weve been here. then, even after the fact of bringing it to managements attention, we were being talked down to being told that we ordered wrong. after waiting over 30 minutes for my correct order to come out i gave up. the only thing the manager did for us was take 10 off our bill. we appreciate your professional courtesy but we wont be visiting you again. we gave a another shot because your food was great, but no delicious entree is worth this stress or headache.
i had a pound of snow crab legs trifecta medium and it was very blah, so right before they bring out the food they bring a rock.... and say they have run out of crackers....really? out of the ten tables around me no one had one ... what kind of place doesnt have enough? it wasnt so busy that they could have possibly run out.... ex: its like ordering a salad and then having them tell you oh and by the way we ran out of forks.... anyway i dont even know how sanitary this rock is and when we tried using it just smooched my crab legs . therefore i didnt even enjoy my meal, i have hopes for improvement! and by the way i  have been to the mesa location which is by far the best and i love it so if its your first time its worth the drive to go to the original one first!
ok this may sound like a rambling but here we gowe just arrived home from the beach and needed to go to the grocery storeinstead as i was going thru the mail i read the article about giving la fiesta grande a second chance. we pull in and notice how nice it is on the patio. we sit down and enjoy our chips and salsa. as soon as our food is delivered it is like attack of the flies. bees start swarming us. the waiter apologizes blaming the bp. we eat in a hurry while the busboy swats flies with a fly swatter. the waiter asks if we need to go boxes and i said no thank you, there were many flies on the food. next thing i know, two managers come up to me and ask me what is wrong. i mention that i did not want to go boxes and they respond that we could of eaten inside awy from the flies. next thing i know the managers friends  who are sitting behind me tell me i should have eaten inside that i am obviously not an outdoor person. the discussion continues and i end up in tears while wearing my be positive hat!!! anyway i am posting to let you know that i do not recommend the mexican restaurant next to the bp at mountain island. please share with mtn island neighbors. i really would not grant this any stars but with yelp you have to at least give one.
never even got to try the pizza. they wouldnt sell me a pizza to go. who opens a pizza place and doesnt sell pizza to go? with two giant beer gardens right next door to them, youd figure they would want to be delivering pizzas right to the beer gardens!  nope. they just want to be snooty. smart business plan!
cons:over promise, under deliver.way over priced.pizza tastes good, but falls apart.gourmet ingredients, but very very sparing.pros:nice music.the pizza came out fast.oh, and i was brought here with someone else paying.
dont call for carryout  they wont do that wouldnt be hot enough or some crap like that. maybe these hipsters pizza is any good, but given their authentically twee business model, i wont be finding out!
let me start by saying that i have never written a yelp review, but due to my experience at pizzeria antica this evening, i feel compelled to do so.  this was our first visit here and we were excited and looking forward to an enjoyable dining evening....which was rapidly downgraded by the nonexistent, smug service and unappetizing pizzathe thing that i want to focus on that was most upsetting to myself and my friend  was the service.  when we arrived, the owner ushered us to a table, grabbed the menus, thrust them at us, and asked us what we wanted to drink and eat.  when my friend said that we needed a minute and told him it was our first time here,he went away...and didnt return for a good 10 minutes.  when he returned to us finally he said, see what happens when youre not ready.we ordered and did get our salad and pizza promptly.  there is no wait staff per saya woman from the kitchen brought out our salads and pizzas and plopped them down without a word.  our pizza had a watery texture and the cheese was clumpy and somewhat cold, literally falling off the pizza in chunks when you picked up a slice.  the pizza also was overcooked, with a burnt crust and gave it a charred, bitter taste.  a clear disappointment.  nobody ever came to check on us during this time, to inquire about our meal or offer refills.then the remainder of the dining experience was a game called, see if you can get someone to pay attention to you so you can pay your check.  even though my friend and i had clearly finished, moved our plates to the side, and were desperately looking around the room, seeking attention, the owner refused to look in our direction.  when finally he deigned us with his presence and we asked for the check, he literally smirked at meand pointed to the number on the table.  he added i guess i should have told you that and then i hope you were not waiting long.  and walked away.  we awkwardly paid and left in a state of disbelief, with mounting anger.  i would think that if you were a new business in town, that you would want to show your potential customers that you appreciate them and that you care about their business, especially in downtown champaign which is teeming with desirable dining options with much better customer service.  i am disgusted by the treatment that my friend and i received from the owner.  he treated us with disdain and seemed uninterested in our experience.  i will never patronize this business again.  i will encourage my friends not to either.  they deserve better.  and so do you.
if you are too busy to come out and answer questions about placing an order for 2 sports teams then you are too busy for my questions.  i gave it two tries.
zero stars! do not go here! what a rip off!!!! i have had eyelash extensions for years and have never had such a bad deal as i have here, and it was a groupon! the groupon deal states it is 35 for an 80 value which seems to be a good deal. you get in, the eyelashes for the groupon deal of 35 are pretty small which is expected since it is a low value deal. the girl offers and up sale for two sizes larger for 75. she does not specify that it is an additional 75 not 75 total to your groupon deal. they want you to get the deal  in house so they can keep all of the money and not pay through groupon, they are strictly using it for marketing purposes and not giving groupon their cut  which would be fine if my lashes looked good for 110. after my shock for being charged 110 not 75 i told them this was a horrible deal i have had lashes on for years and they will not be able to compete with those around town. they just looked at me dumbfounded and had nothing to say. other than being extremely over charged, the receptionist screams on the phone the entire time, very nice, but also very ghetto sounding. it is hard to relax while you are laying on an uncomfortable table for an hour and a half getting lashes done. real spas with comfortable reclining chairs blankets soft music and dim lights will not have an issue with this horrible establishment staying open and being competitive for long.
on thursday my coworker and i went to get lashes for the first time, and referred a couple of people i work with. keep in mind this is my first time getting them done. i did notice one eye was fuller than the other but thought it was normal called them on the 5th day and refused to fix my lashes used a groupon and paid to upgrade. basically the only option they gave to pay for additional mini fill. all ive ask is to remove some from the other to look even they were we not accommodating at all. will not come back and have other coworkers canceling there appointments.
i was very excited to go in and get the 3d tattoo eyebrows done. when i got to the salon they were playing trap music  hip hop. the vibe was cold and unprofessional. it looked cheap and trashy. i should have left at this point but i stayed because of my deposit. let me tell you she was over an hour late to do my eyebrows. so i sat there waiting with numbing cream on my eyebrows .  once i got in the chair the eyebrows themselves didnt take more than 45 minutes. once i got up to look i  was not happy at all. the left eyebrow was smudged  and it was somewhere between a full fill in and a 3d hairstroke. the right brow is way shorter than the left brow and i had gaps of nothing that needed to be filled in still . they basically looked just half done  and horribly half done at that . let me say neezie is very nice however i feel like she did a horrible job. it is not even two weeks later and the right brow is almost completely gone! yes! the tattoo is almost completely gone! if i want to go in for a touch up i have to pay another 50....and ive already paid 300! my eyebrows are not even, they are bare and faded. i honestly feel like i got ripped off. i want to ask for a refund but i doubt i will get it .  im already looking for somewhere to go to fix them .  i absolutely do not recommend her. i paid 300 for eyebrows for a weekone more thing that i think is important is that neezie is not a licensed esthetician, she has no medical background meaning she knows nothing about skin, sanitation, medical conditions etc. if i would have known all of this in advance i probably would of picked somebody else.
called to make a lash appointment, they have no techs to do lashes nor do they know when theyll be getting any... the girl who answered the phone olivia was so rude and hung up on me while i was still talking. i heard good things about this place but so irritated with how the phone call went b
if youre looking for a good bao place to go avoid this place at all costs.does not even come close to satay bros.the place is not appealing and the food baos were hugely disappointing.
super cher pour de toutes petites portions. cetait bon, mais pas assez pour le prix  deux tranches de concombre un morceau miserable de salade un bout de poisson perdu au milieu du mini baoles frites etaient surgelees... et en plus, il y en avait pas beaucoup! tant mieux ! cetait pas bon !
not my type of nail salon. its the day after my nails were done and theyre peeling and chipping!! i was also asked for my address which strikes me as strange and now i regret leaving it. i went in with a groupon voucher and left completely disappointed but happy that i didnt pay the full price which is outlandish for the work i had done. worst money ive ever spent!!!
i didnt like the way the nail polisher was applied it was all over on my skin around the nail and the skin around my nails was not trimmed or clean. in couple days after i had my nails done the nail gel polisher start pilling of  it would just completely come off leavening my nail clean ...it was just waste of money
i grew up in buffalo, and spent the first 24 years of my life there, and have visited every year since.  i know my food.  i hoped this wasnt going to be a monumental misrepresentation of something great, but i was wrong.  i dont mind paying twice the price i would have at any restaurant in buffalo, but give me what youre telling everyone you can. the chicken wings were rubbery, slimy, and absolutely inexcusably disgusting.  there were parts of feather still attached to half the single order put in front of me.  if this garbage was served anywhere in buffalo, the restaurant would fail in a week.  the bleu cheese is straight mucus, and has the consistency of water.  its awful.  how in the world can you put this crap out in front of people?!  did anyone from buffalo come out to make sure the food was proper?  you guys should be absolutely embarrassed putting out this product astonishingly bad.  im blown away.  what a joke.when i told the girl why i pushed a full plate of uneaten food back, she gave me an uncomfortable look.  silence.  no offer to redo the food, no apology, no manager, no refund.  absolutely infuriating.  never, ever again.  this is not food from buffalo do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.
this place is definitely not a redo. the hubs is a chicken wing fanatic so we ordered wings and meatballs. the wings were good. crispy, nice flavor. the chicken meatballs, omg, first they were 9 for 6 meatballs which were way smaller than a golf ball, super salty and dry. i was so mad for wasting 9. i went to the counter to tell them how horrible they were. they guy just shrugged his shoulders and said sorry. thats it. nothing more. i would not recommend this place for their poor service like so many others have mentioned in their reviews. i repeatdo not order the meatballs!!!!
im new to the state and just wanted somebody to answer some questions on what i had to do to get a drivers license change from california along with my vehicle registration. im sorry i cant help you sir i cant answer your questions you have to take a number and sit in line before someone can answer your questions not much help i guess ill go to mvd. not the best area of town so dont send your loved ones.
dont ever go to this place for drivers license stuff!!!!!  worst experience ever ...and i still didnt get done what was needed. they never called the number i was given and finally after waiting for an hour n 15 minutes i went up and asked...they confirmed that they had skipped my number and instead of helping me right then they told me i had to start the process all over and gave me a new number.  this place is a total joke and waste of time!!!
worst customer srevice ever.  after over three years of loyalty, my husband and i have stopped using sunrise cab for good. when i inquired very politely and calmly about the long wait for a cab, then mentioned that this was why i wasnt using them regularly anymore, the dispatcher jim hung up on me. i called back, thinking this had been a mistake, and he was very proud of himself, acknowledging that hed hung up on me, then did it again.  i was sure that the owner, bud, would not be happy about this, so i called back later to speak with him. again, i was calm  simply wanted to let him know that his dispatcher had deliberately hung up on a previously loyal customer.  then bud hung up on me.  i asked my husband to call  and bud hung up on him, before he could say a word.  were blown away, and wouldnt step foot in their cabs again to save our lives.  this is a shame, because weve always found them to be reliable and inexpensive, if slow very very slow.  im amazed that a business can remain solvent in this economy when it hangs up on loyal customers who dare to provide a bit of feedback about something that is pretty universally recognized as a downside to their service read the other reviews for confirmation.  im disappointed, but mostly because i thought we had built a strong relationship with this local company.   silly of me.
damn. unbelievably horrible. cab smelled like gasoline, driver appeared intoxicated, and the meter did not work. asked the driver to let me out 1 block from my pickup.
if i can give this company zero star, thats what id do!we were catching a flight out from phoenix airport on thursday morning, i called the company on wednesday asking if i can reserve a cab service for the next morning, the dispatcher told me to call on thursday morning and hell have the cab ready for me. so i called on thursday morning at 6am to reserve the cab for 8:30am at the hayden ferry building on e rio salado parkway in tempe.  we were catching a flight at 9:40am.  when it was 8:35am, our cab didnt show up, so i called the company and he told me the cab is 5 minutes away, the driver will contact me.  2 minutes later, i got the call from the driver, telling me he just received the call from the dispatcher, and it will take him at least 20 minutes to get to our location, it was 8:40am then.  i called the dispatcher, he asked me where im going and he said: oh youll be just fine, the airport is only 5 minutes away.  first of all, the airport is at least 10 minutes away it actually ended up taking us almost 15 minutes to get to the airport when the cab finally came.  second, its none of his business to tell me whether im fine or not, i reserved the cab for 8:30am, he doesnt know where im going, he doesnt know whether its urgent, the fact that its 8:40am and the cab is 20 minutes away is unacceptable.  so i told him we cant wait for another 20 minutes, so he got another cab thats closer to come pick us up.  the cab driver then called me and said hes 7 minutes away.  we waited for 20 minutes because he couldnt find the building and decided to just park somewhere on rio salado parkway and hoping that well show up, after a really frustrated attempt to explain to him where we were actually located, the cab is finally here.  it was 9:05am.  the cab driver told us it was his 4th day on the job, so apparently thats the reason he cant find where we were at.  if i were him, id invest in a gps, or else the cab driver career probably will be short and probably not very sweet for him.we got to the airport close to 9:20am.  the cab driver asked us whether its arrival or departure.  we were glad he checked with us vs. just take us to arrival, but we thought its a nobrainer since we were in such a hurry and we had 3 luggages with us.  anyways...with the combination of very efficient tsa service and a slightly delayed flight, we were able to catch our flight, but it was very very close.  we will never ever use this company again!
wow, the dispatcher picks up the phone sounding annoyed that i called, then immediately puts me on hold.  okay fine, maybe hes working a double, i can forgive the attitude.  when he gets back on the phone, i tell him i need a ride to the airport, give him my location in chandler, and ask for an estimate.  his reply: i dont even know where that is.  wow!  i then asked if he would like me to google that for him, and he said hold on. thats when i hung up.  if i ran a cab company, the last thing i would ever want to hear out of any of my employees mouths would be i dont know where that is, there are plenty of other words you can use, when you dont know a specific location.  the initial attitude, i could forgive, the attitude plus outright stupidity; one single shinny gold star for you my friend.
welp, a month in phoenix and nothing changed here. i only called sunrise again because the first cab company i called didnt answer, and i figured oh, what the heck. sunrise is cheaper and i have to go from central phx to freakin w union hills in glendale, so i might save anyway. big mistake, cowpoke.taxi got here promptly, but other than that everything went downhill. the driver seemed confused about the destination, but he had a gps and entered it into it. well, first he starts the wrong way and i clearly hear the gps say turn left and he gets in the right lane nearing a light. so, i say something and he goes i know it said turn left as he heads straight. he stops, obviously confused, at the nearest gas station and starts fiddling with the device some more. i ended up just entering the address in my phones gps and giving him every little direction there. it was like talking to a child no...no, this exit. i just dont get how a person who is driving a taxi can be so navigationally challenged, even with a gps device. if i take a taxi, i just want to say where im going and not have to worry about it.if you want to pay to do half the taxi work and be stressed, call up sunrise today!
worst cab ride, car and driver ever!  i could have overlooked the old car,even the duck tape holding the door on, after all it is inexpensive, but as soon as we get in he says he needs a gas station.  we run out of gas at the station.  the air conditioning did not work, not cool for phoenix.  driver could not stay in the lanes, did not have a clue where to go, nearly crashed at the 7th street exit off the 17, not sure why he was trying to take it anyway, car sounded like it was going to siege up when he accelerated.  a moron driver, an unsafe car does not offset the cheap cost.  the only good thing is we made it alive.  discount, we learned our lesson, thanks for taking us home.
we were 4 miles from the airport on a sunday with no traffic and one road to the airport. as soon as we entered the cab the driver asked if he can go any route. we responded the shortest route. the driver proceeded to take us on an 8.5 mile out of the way long route. what tipped me off was getting on the highway going directly in the opposite direction of the airport. a few miles into it, we called him on it, he got nervous and pulled out in front of 50mph oncoming traffic on the off ramp while at a red light. on top of that, the car he had was a piece of junk, literally. torn up seats, dirty, stains, etc. i do not recommend this cab company, or would even entertain using them myself again.
unbelievably poor service. was picked up by a cab driver who asked to be payed up front. when i told him no he kicked me out of his cab on the side of the road well out of my way. not only that, but he insulted my intelligence repeatedly. will never use this service again and warn anyone thinking of using them to seek transportation elsewhere.
called the phone number listed here on yelp.  20 rings, no answer.  gave up.  if a taxi company doesnt answer their phone, theyre not worth the trouble.
i literally just off the phone with an a that said he doesnt provide service where i am and hung up on me before i could say anything. that was the rudest business phone call ive ever had.
lets start with the arrivial time. 45 min from when i called.. no big deal, ill save 10 bucks over other cabs to wait.. the cab, old and beat to hell.  the driver, nice guy but smelly. the ride? heh, it is reaching record temps today and no ac in the cab. wtf, this is az...  only one star because of the cab not having ac.
i see nobody rated the bar in this restaurant..ive been in this industry for some time.i understand that kinks need to be worked out, but ive never seen such incompetence with bartenders in my life. i think they hired with zero experience or any common knowledge of customer service. my bartender was alyson, among other girl bartenders. i ordered a moscow mule...pretty simple drink one would think, it took ten minutes to get due to the fact that she was flirting with the managerhe didnt seem to mind, with the smiles and touching he reciprocated and the fact that she couldnt find any off the 2 ingredients to the drink. it was so disappointing for a new restaurant that looked do promising. completely unprofessional atmosphere and disappointing..i think this place should reevaluate its staff..managers included. will not be returning unless things improve
service was terrible waited over 45 min for a pick up order placed 30 minutes in advance of me arriving.
never going back again. .. the second time around was worst.  the food was horrible! who is this cook? not just that, i have never experienced flies in a restaurant. .. annoying! i bet they cook with the back door open.
with all the choices diners have, good service and management cost owners nothing and reap many rewards. sadly fire rock has no clue.we walked in to the restaurant today about 15 minutes after opening. there were 2 parties ahead of us and names were taken for all of us. 1st party seated and there were 2 parties of 2 people each left to seat.  we were both told the host person would be with us in a second. she took several place set ups with her under her arm eeeewww and walked off. returns a moment later with the manager and tells all of us that she has to count tables and set ups and will be back then walks away. the manager laughs and tells all of us it will be worth the wait then proceeds to look at the tablet. both my party and the other party waited 5 more minutes but the host person never returned nor did the manager ever seat any of us. after the wait and no word or attempt to seat diners, we walked out and the other couple did as well.the restaurant was only a quarter to third full so i dont understand letting business walk out the door to count tables and set ups by both an employee and manager. needless to say this location has been several other restaurants previously and closed, i predict the same for fire rock and deservedly so!
wait time was very nice, only 15 min for a party of 8. we went on a sunday evening for dinner. our server was nice but was very forgetful, she forgot two of the eight orders and had to come back to our table twice to fix that. she brought us our cokes and then no refills. they ran out of bread before we even arrived, so no bread. the food was okay, ive had better for less price. on top of that, two of the wait staff began to fight right in the middle of the dining room! all in all it was a bad night.
just another steakhouse... we went sunday night for our wedding anniversary. we were greeted by the hostess that had rbf and wasnt polite at all. this place is also extremely loud and they sat us right next to where the servers all come out of the kitchen  horrible. as we were reviewing the menu 2 servers broke out in a fullon brawl. they were punching each other in the face and throwing each other against the wall. we immediately got up and left. as we were walking out to the car one of the servers that was in the fight was running fast to his car. not sure if he was just leaving or getting something else to aid him in the fight  wasnt waiting around to find out either....ridiculous!!!
i also waited for them to be open for a bit before going  and believe me, they still have plenty of kinks to work out.  the food is mediocre at best  mine was awful.  and the service leaves a lot to be desired.  i ordered the new york steak 32.95 with a wedge salad, my brother ordered the smothered chicken with the soup of the day.  we sat and talked and quite a bit of time went by, no bread, no nothing.  then, the runner came with my wedge salad, but not the soup.  then seriously, 30 seconds later, before i had time to even bite into the salad, here come the entrees.  i told the runner, i just got this salad about 30 seconds ago, and my brother ordered soup, which is still not here.  so they just brought the soup.  the runner was very apologetic, but it wasnt her fault  we never heard from our server again til the bill arrived.  no apologies for the ridiculous timing.  my brother said his entree was pretty good.  my steak was terrible  i took one bite, and it was gross  a weird rubbery texture, like maybe it had been frozen.  but whatever the reason  it was bad.  ive had better steaks at the sizzler.  i took it home and gave it to the dogs.  never saw a manager either  and they could really use one!
ive been waiting to try this restaurant for a while now and have been really looking forward to it. called for thursday 6pm reservations, was told they have a wait list they can add me to, but dont take reservations? odd, but ok. i immediately received a text saying weve been added. cool stuff. we arrived and had about a 5 minute wait for out table. the restaurant has a great vibe, nice decorations and you can smell the wood fires. really liking this place! soon after we sat, we realized this place has serious issues. we sat for at least 10 minutes before anyone came to bring water, ask for drinks etc. i saw several servers running like headless chickens. i also saw what i think were 1 perhaps 2 managers strolling around doing nothing like they didnt have a worry in the world. the menu is great, lots of great choices.  i really wanted to try several items.we ordered finally and got a pan of great bread dropped on the table. waited another 5 minutes and finally called someone over so we could get silverware and napkins.  at least something to spread butter with. things arent looking good.our waiter came finally and took our order. we then sat there for 35 minutes before seeing him again before our dinners arrived. now were so agitated it doesnt matter if the food is great or not. weve been here going on an hour still waiting...on a thursday! got our dinners, finished them, waited another 10 minutes, bussed our own dishes, asked for the check and left. wont even comment on food as the entire experience was ruined by the total lack of service in what is hoping to be a midto high end steak house.just so disappointed in this place, we really need more choices in the n.w. but fire rock will not be around long unless they get their act together.
everything about our experience was terrible. i went to dinner with my family for my birthday and it was definitely the worst way to spend it. at first, we waited an hour to be seatedthis wasnt a big deal, ive waited this long at other restaurants. after being seated, the server took our drink order and took 20 minutes to bring them to us. not only did it take this long just for drinks, but she only brought out 2 of our drinks then took another 5 to bring out the other two. after that, she took our food order and didnt come check on us until after the runners brought out our food an hour and ten minutes later. not only was this an extremely long wait, but others who were seated after we were, got their food long before we did. the server never gave us silver wear, so we had to ask the runners for some. to continue the disappointment, our food was all cold. the server also never told us there were no mashed potatoes, so they brought out steak fries instead without asking for a side replacement. we were still waiting on a couple other items, but just decided to cancel them because we refused to wait any longer. the manager came over to talk to us and offered to take 50 off of our bill, but other tables around us called him over as he was walking away to complain as well. extremely disappointed with everything about this evening, both the service and food. would never recommend this place to anyone. and refuse to return.
so we gave this place a few weeks to get open get through the new restaurant opening jitters. probably shouldnt have gone here on our anniversary but we thought it was a new steakhouse how could we go wrong. number one it was happy hour on a sunday night at 5:30 so it took us 30 minutes to get seated and a place was extremely noisy. they offer good deals on their appetizers but the appetizers we tried really werent that great. we tried the crab cakes which were half price probably werent worth 2 bucks. they came lukewarm and i thought someone undercooked. the sauce that drizzled on them was pretty much tasteless. my wife ordered the prime rib and i ordered the cajun ribeye. she orders the side of asparagus and i ordered a side baked potato loaded. asparagus she asked for grilled instead of staying it was probably the only decent item on the table. prime rib was bland and the horseradish they brought to go with it was crap. my ribeye if it if it didnt have salt on it would have had no taste at all. didnt taste like there was any cajun seasoning on it all. wait what we wanted but the rest in a to go box for the dogs. so sad that we wasted our anniversary on this place. i dont care if its happy hour or not you take care of your customers tired of hearing the excuse . hope this is helpful to you all youre looking for a good steak dinner. i wish we had gone to bob taylors ranch house instead.
it might just be me, but when you step into firerock, it feels like youre literally walking into the one and only shenanigans. this place has the cookie cutter chain restaurant feeling down to a science. from the cheesy decor trying to look like an upscale steakhouse, to the terrible service from waiters who obviously dont want to be there, and the mediocre and overpriced food, its like youre on the set of a movie...we sat down here for dinner this past sunday night at around 5:30. with it being fairly new to an area with otherwise almost no good restaurants, i thought it would be much busier than it was. after all was said and done, i could see why it wasnt. honestly, its surprising to me that people would come here more than once, but i guess thats what keeps all these chain restaurants alive and kicking.when it comes to the menu here, it looks small at first, but has a whole bunch of options. i just really dont get those options. firerock steakhouse is supposed to specialize in steaks its in their name, yet they only have a few cuts of meats...with the rest of the menu having everything from street tacos to a monte cristo. maybe the concept is just over my head, but their menu literally has about a quarter of a page featuring steaks, and thats it.because it is a steakhouse, of course i wanted to try their steak. i ended up deciding on the cajunspiced ribeye, which for whatever reason is 2 more than their regular ribeye. the only difference it its supposed to have cajun spices, which i think to them only means cayenne and paprika, and then some creole butter. im almost positive they just use the exact stuff sold in a jar that goes by that name, and thats where they are getting the 2 upcharge from. you might have guessed it by now, but this steak was nowhere near worth its 26 price tag. i requested it mediumrare and it was overcooked. very little marbling in the meat, not much fat or flavor, and a really thin cut. you can see from my picture that there was virtually no juice from the meat on the plate, and it stayed that way even after being cut into. any juicy was likely from the jarred creole butter anyway.what made firerock even worse is the service. i realize they are still pretty new, but theyve been open almost 2 months now. youd think theyd have a good amount of the kinks worked out, but that just isnt the case. our waiter looked like he was in hell, and every time hed fill a drink cup, hed slam the cup on the table like he was taking out his aggression on my poor iced tea. id say thank you, hed walk away without saying a word. we had to ask for things more than once, and just to get some bread took 10 minutes. he just didnt really seem to care to be there at all.and while maybe not directly his fault, our salads took almost 30 minutes to come out, with our main entrees taking just over an hour. with our small party of 6, and the restaurant pretty slow overall, it shouldnt have taken nearly that long. to add fuel to the fire, my wife ordered a filet cooked medium, yet it came out much closer to mediumrare and was basically cold to the touch.as i said, im not sure what firerock is going for. a menu thats all over the place with crap service and mediocre, overpriced food is a recipe for disaster. the good thing they have going for them is they are maybe 12 a stepup from an outback, and are surrounded by other crappy restaurants. for people who constantly frequent mediocre chain restaurants, this might be a welcome addition...for everyone else, methinks not. eat somewhere else, enjoy your food.
we went to fire rock for my motherinlaws birthday lunch. we had two waitresses, s. and a new one that was in training. dont know her name but she was nice and tried to do everything right. s., however, didnt seem very pleased or happy. we ordered a ny strip, turkey club and buffalo chicken sandwich as well as a jalapeno burger. buffalo chicken wasnt great, had kind of a weird flavor. the side of steak fries was served cold, the steak on the ny strip sandwich was very greasy and literally had a whole strip of fat on the side. its a sandwich so you would expect them to cut it off before they put a piece of meat on the bun.. couldnt chew it and did complain after half off the sandwich was eaten and the second half didnt look better. the new waitress apologized and forwarded the complaint. she came back and said that something new could be ordered and theyre sorry. s. checked in with us as well but again, she didnt seem very friendly. after the new sandwich was served, i went to tell the waitresses that its my motherinlaws birthday and asked if they had any kind of free dessert for these occasions. s. simply shook her head without a smile and said no, we dont do that. but you can order our 7layer chocolate dessert and we can put a candle on top. not expecting an answer like this, i said i would think about it and let them know if i wanted to order something. i dont know any restaurant that doesnt give a free dessert when its somebodys birthday, especially after the whole ny strip scenario and cold fries they owed us, i felt like. when we were getting ready to leave, the waitress said thanks again and sorry about the ny strip and  happy birthday! which made the whole situation really awkward.. my fatherinlaw looked at his wife and asked how did they know its your birthday? so i had to say that i had told them and asked for a dessert but they didnt do that at fire rock. everybody was surprised and thought the same. unfortunately, we wont be back.
i wanted to give a good review, im sorry i cant. when we walked in the door, we were instantly confused. the atmosphere is of a high end steakhouse, but there are enough loud tvs to be a sports bar. with all the sports bars and sports books here, no one would come here to watch a game... and they kill the steakhouse feel. when we went to the bar while waiting on our table. the service was slowww. the bartender ignored us. we were helped by the servicetender, between him filling orders for the waitresses.our booth was nice and comfortable for 4 people, but the table was small.  the salads were good, but slow arriving. so, of course, the meal arrived way too soon. i hate that. so do you forget the salad and start eating the hot food, or finish the salad and eat a cold steak? or send the food back to sit under a heatlamp? and remember the small table?!!!!!!person 1 the pasta was boring.person 2 the burger and mushrooms were overlooked.person 3 the steak was flavorless and tasted microwaved.person 4 me the bacon filet was small. cut several times on the edge obviously checking for doneness. dry and rubbery. and it looked smaller than it actually was because there was no garnish to fill the blank area of the large plate o platter presentation.the waitress did come check on us several times, but never prebused, even though i did and used plates were stacked! did i mention the small table?my friend ordered a vodka martini at the bar, very nice presentation. when he ordered his second at the table, it was a shot of vodka in a cocktail glass with his olives carried separately in her other hand. well, we were all so overit by this point, he just poured the shot in his empty martini glass and tossed in the olives.when we want a highend lounge, we will go elsewhere....when we want a steakhouse, we will go elsewhere...when we want a sportsbar, we will go elsewhere...
i generally dont care to haggle over service issues in a  dining establishment but when i do its usually with someone who is a very poor excuse for a f and b manager! party of 6 walks in place is swamped and very understaffed its very noticeable when your seated waiting 30 minutes to give a drink order.. great! order for drinks is in and we even get an appetizer ordered! 15 minutes for drinks to come to table and then 40 minutes for a spin dip that youve asked about twice since receiving drinks... now nobody comes back for 45 minutes to take food order or give drink refills.. when the order comes out its wrong and we dont complain because who wants to wait for an additional 45 minutes to eat dinner. the topper.. sandwich comes out served with no bread because cook dropped the pizza bread on ground and now theres no more to offer... total joke was that when the manager comes to the table he has no idea how to deal with 6 aggrivated patrons. get a real manager who knows how to schedule servers! sad this is a nice place the nwest  needs this place and its horrible. 3 times weve visited and each time the service was worse than the last. they need a rescue for sure.. we arent in wy. we are in las vegas and we know what service is!!! total dining time 4 hours! on a six top the corp should have had 2.5 tabkes in and out.. fair warning local patrons!! i dont care how yummy the food was one time poor management is a deal breaker..
first we  must have had our cloak of invisibility on because we were forgotten.. waited at table for 15 min without anyone coming. i got up and asked for a server... 8 minutes more someone finally showed up.we should have left then.. but then we couldnt have experienced  our cold steak, raw shrimp , soggy salad and cold bread in a fake fresh baked pan. my water glass was so dry .. no refills.. water  must be extra:oh wait theres more.. we just wanted to leave but needed to wait an extra 10 minutes just to get our check after asking or server. he also poured tea onto our table.. missing the glass leaving a huge puddle, then barely missed my head with the pitcher.there were only 4 other tables with people. there were more servers than guests! i will never return. they do not know what there doing there.terrible service.. food very poor.. the only nice thing was the atmosphere.
bad news for us, i had high hopes we finally got a good restaurant in centennial hills. service poor, food sizzler quality, cold sizzler. nice building, i wonder who will buy it next.
should have listened to the reviews on here... crappy customer service: plenty of people walked by while we were waiting to ask for a table not so much as a hello or we will be with you shortly. then told us itd be a 25 minute wait when we saw several tables open. dont plan on coming back but the food was decent. too bad they couldnt improve their customer service...
my husband i really liked this place, but after today we wont be back.  i have recommended this place to family, clients, and friends so i was happy to have some friends join us today.  first, they forgot our reservation, but it didnt really matter the place was dead.  our drink and food orders were taken together and when our appetizers came i told my friend her tacos were different.  the server piped in that they changed their menu.  these were nasty and covered in cole slaw.  when our meal came they completely forgot one of my friends meal.  the server had the nerve to ask her if she had ordered food.  seriously?  then it was the last on the ticket then turned into the kitchen staff must have forgot to its being rushed now  it would have just been fine if she just sucked it up and said she forgot to put the order in.  my food was cold and inedible,  husbands steak was overcooked, and we had to beg for refills.  this place was pretty good when they first opened.  after today i will never be back or tell anyone to spend their money here.  my friend without her lunch just wanted to let it go but i stopped to talk to the manager about how shitty the service was.  she didnt know, but then its too late.  management should know what is going on in their restaurant by making sure servers go to them when its a colossal goof, not ask if a patron even ordered a meal in a place you go to order a meal.  never again.
we were there to celebrate a birthday, which is supposed to be a happy occasion.service was slow and all food cold by the time we were finally served. we were too hungry to wait for a second round to be cooked and served, as offered by the manager. we left. fire rock has lost out on at least 8 return diners.  even though new to the area, as a chain, they are not new to the business so they should have their act together.such a disappointment for a long awaited first and last visit.
i reviewed this place a couple of moths ago, sharing the terrible service we received while waiting 45 minutes for our happy hour appetizers and then another hour for our sandwiches. not once did anyone come to our table to apologize for the wait. my son, his friend and i left as soon as our very simple sandwiches were served, we had not anticipated this being a two hour adventure. hmmm, my review was removed. i wonder by who and why? it was terrible. i had really hoped that this would be a great option for us out here in the northwest corner of vegas, i guess we will need to wait for it to close down again and see what it opens as next!
if i couldnt rate this with any stars, i would but, yelp requires a star entry  the restaurant is beautiful but, the service was horrible and all of the employees we saw look like they are frazzled and unhappy. after waiting 45 minutes for food filet oscar and 8 oz sirloin and hearing the lady manager yelling the f word at her employees about running salads we were less than enjoying our dining experience. my steak was way overcooked i ordered medium rare and it was borderline medium well to well and cold and my wifes side loaded sweet potato was ice cold and hard in the center. we didnt ask to speak to anyone as we had already heard her non professionalattitude toward her employees. this is far from any fine dining restaurant we have ever visited. we will never be back.
returning customers, giving this another try. sad to say, so bad we are not coming back. we realize things happen, employees dont show up etc. we are business owners too. at first the manager was taking care of tables. we quickly realized the manager was taking care of most of the tables. my salad was finally brought out and i had to pick out a large pile of wilted lettuce disguised by mixing it with iceberg lettuce. because i am diabetic and have foods i cannot eat, i was anxious to eat a meal as i was beginning to not feel so well from the long wait. i asked the manager what was going on. she was pleasant at first, until we asked her what was up with the hour wait for our dinner. she gave a sharp remark which we felt was not necessary. after waiting for an hour  15 min for two meals.....my husbands food was luke warm and my sea bass was luke warm, dry, the fish color was brownish fish, instead of flaky white. the taste was so bad i refused to take another bite, fearing it could be spoiled. we were so upset that we told the manager forget it and walked out. other patrons were complaining over their wait as well. if there is a problem, be honest, dont keep your guest in the dark  it only makes waiting so long more maddening by being ignored. i dont see this place lasting much longer if something isnt fixed!
our server was very nice but we waited over 45 minutes after ordering food that we ordered when we placed our drink order.  they were out of at least 3 things that we tried to order.  my daughters kid mac and cheese had a jalapeno in it to which she cried and spit out.  our steaks were good but not warm when they came out.  never refilled waters or really even took plates away.  just a poor experience overall.
we went on a recommendation. waitstaff was nice, but there was a long wait for our dishes once we were seated. they also dont have hot tea which i prefer with my meals. once the food arrived, it was less than appealing. the asparagus and lobster mac and cheese were microwaved and arrived cold.  my wifes steak was pretty middle of the road. i will say the steak fries were tasty however, my shrimp left much to be desired.
i decided to give this place a try, it had a very nice atmosphere, very warm and comforting. we arrived late afternoon. i ordered a30 8oz steak wrapped in bacon it was burnt. only asked for it to be medium cooked. literally all i could taste was the char so i asked for some sauce to make it bearable. we didnt even get any bread upon arrival. my partner said he would rate his chicken at a 3.  2 hours after leaving my bank calls me and informed me of a fraud charge from out of state, i called the manager of the restaurant to inform them not accusing anything just stating the facts and her attitude about it was very lackadaisical, she didnt care. i will not be returning nor recommending this location. steer clear.
i was disappointed with the quality of food. we had the rib eye and it was plain. glad i tried this place but i wont be coming here again.
the service at firerock is the absolute worst ive ever experienced. sat in the bar area with my girlfriend, as there was no wait and they dont take reservations. we sat at a filthy table, waited 10 minutes for drinks. my moscow mule was ice and a lime garnish. literally no liquid at all. the unapologetic server took it back to the bar to return by saying that they couldnt make a moscow mule anymore... im not sure if they ran out of vodka or lime juice. either way, when i was charged for it on the receipt i wasnt happy. she came back a few minutes later and said i know, before i could explain the error. while i wasnt charged for the stella draft i got instead; it was little consolation for the complete lack of apology for the entire experience for all the wait times, screwups and lack of service quality in general. didnt get the servers name not that it was all her fault, but regardless, we wont be back. sorry for eating here. good day, sir.
first and last time there! went there for our anniversary. the table they were going to put us was right near the door area. asked for another table which they accommodated. no one ever came. no water, nothing. waited 15 minutes. they werent busy, only a handful of customers were there.  a group of 4 came in, say down close to us and got waited on. it was like we were invisible. decided to leave and while exciting past our original assigned table sat 2 people drinking beer and had obviously already ordered. they werent in the restaurant when we arrived either. very poor service. so we went across the street to another restaurant.
first time here. food was average and service was terrible. carpaccio and salads were really good. beer can chicken was ok. chicken was juicy but the mac and cheese was way to salty. italian sandwich had no flavor. patty melt was terrible. came out over cooked on burnt texas toast that was soggy in the middle. fish and chips were bad to. outside was soggy, coleslaw had no mayo on it. plain shredded cabbage. we had to ask hostesses for things our table needed and the manager to take back the patty melt. the server barely checked on us and was painfully slow. we wont be returning. id rather eat down on the strip where i know im getting a quality meal and awesome service!
definitely not the best first experience! had the 911 during the end of my shift, and i needed a pick me up. i dont know if it was the 6 espresso shots or the whole milk, but it tore my stomach apart. lets just say the end of my shift was anything but slow.
cockroaches, cockroaches and more cockroaches!  after you get over your new roommates  the cockroaches  you realize you have now moved into a high crime area, stabbings, assaults and domestic violence are common place here.  in fact i even had one victim of a resident sit in front of my unit for over 2 hours talking the police and asking to use my phone....i didnt need the drama until 11pm.  my lock on the apartment broke and when i called emergency maintence i was told there would a charge to let me in and i better have cash.  what??? cash at 10 pm and because the lock on the door broke?? something is not right.  then there is the leasing office, it must be a terrible place to work because they cant keep staff so they are constantly training which is their excuse for rarely returning phones class and for not following through on anything.  after 10 months of trying to get rid of bugs i was told i could break my lease and leave but of course after i found a new place they claimed miscommunication i could only break my lease if i went to another pb bell property not to a property of my choosing and not this a significant price increase and another year lease.  after being so poorly treated 1. waited 3 hours in the sun to be allowed to move in since the leasing agent was late to work 2. being told i wasnt allowed to inspect my unit in the state of arizona 3. moving into a dirty unit with cockroaches 4. having the leasing office keep whatever hours they wished would i give this property management service more money and sign another lease??  do yourself a favor, dont rent from sonoma villas.  there is nothing but cockroaches, over flowing trash, bad management and violence.
i lived in this community for a year and six months and i agree with a lot of the things the other girl posted about. 1. leasing office  the posted hours are not what they stick to. a few times i left work early just to make it there before they closed and they were not open. this was at 4pm on a thursday. i understand sometimes things come up but if it happens more than once that is a problem. maintenancei used there service request form online and if you dont call or email to follow up the maintenance department will not come. my water heater broke and was leaking in my spare room and they fixed it but left the soaked carpet to smell like mildew. i had to call to complain for them to even think about replacing the carpet in the area. rent increase the final straw for me leaving was when they told me my rent would increase when i didnt have any updates or patio. i thought it would be outrageous to pay any more than i was already paying for something i hated. neighborhood  i thought it wouldnt be that bad but it was. police always there and homeless people walking around. i rarely went outside unless i had too. pool i went in the pool a total of 3 times. each time the pool was really dirty and my key only worked on one of the gates. why have two gates if your key doesnt work for both? deposit lastly, i am highly upset with management for giving me a third of my deposit back when i left the apartment the same way i was given it. i think charging 200 for a paint job is crazy. im just glad to be gone and happy i dont have to deal with this place anymore. i didnt have any bugs but thats because i had a hundred traps and sprayed twice a month. i hate bugs and would have died if i had to live with them. do not move here if you dont have too! the only reason i stayed that long was the rent was cheap and i had more money to shop for clothes and shoes. lol
dont move to sonoma villas the apartements have a strong mildew smell when they are closed up. the apartement had mold.  was told she came to my aptment with a a huge additude . insisting that it wasn mold that it was dust and i need to clean up the inside of where the hot water heater is. she said that there is alittle mold in each apartment but itś controlled so it is okay cause its under standards. my do started to have respitory issues 3 days after being here. i was informed of a sick stray diseased cat that some guys dog got sick from. would have been nice had she told people around the complex about this like she did when she sent out a flier telling everyone to pick up after there dog or she would fine them or evict them. she is just over all not a friendly person the guy below her should be the manager he is more personable and friendly....
complete garbage. no shepherds pie. no redbreast. i got a mediocre burger with 2 quarter slices of bacon, because irish wasnt an option.i also got a very small shot of thin midleton rare for 28. and a black and tan but no harp....just smithy...because they dont have harp either.what a shit show. but the staff talks in an accent...so just throw your money on the ground, get a limerick, and walk away. soul is a block down.i wont be back. irish my ass.
terrible service. no by the waitresses, but by the management, treated like a dog that they hated.
i was really looking forward to trying the bar menu at texas de brazil, but when my friend and i arrived at the bar, we were incredibly disappointed.  not only were we completely ignored when we sat down, we were still ignored after i went up to the bar to get menus.  i would have understood if it had been a busy night, but there were at least 3 bartenders just standing behind the bar doing nothing.  the food may be great although i only know from other reviews, but the service is terrible.  if i could give this location zero stars, i would.
lower than one star would have been my choice but alas i am stifled by the rating system.my first time ever coming here to eat let alone to celebrate an anniversary with my gf the front desk staff turned me off from ever coming back.  inexperienced customer service seems to be part of the application process. what a shame, to think we chose to attempt dining here over our favorite sushi bar.  well at least our sushi wont disappoint.  for not even getting a chance to try their menu i would rather continue my days saying that ive never been here nor tried their food.  perhaps that could have been their saving grace, unfortunately i couldnt tell you.
we had reservations at 7:45pm.. heres 8:01pm and we are still waiting to be seated. whats the point on making a reservation when you have to wait to be called while the whole time i see people that came in after us and have been seated before us. disappointing. this is why we like to go to via brasil better. we only came here because we have friends in town from reno. way to go on putting on a first impression. customer service is not the greatest at the front. i will update after dinner with service.
my wife took me here for my birthday...the bad: the meat was so salty we could hardly eat it. we ate a little bit of it and about 10 minutes later our bellies felt like balloons. we were so physically uncomfortable we had to cut the meal short and left. we felt bloated for almost 2 days.i complained to the server about the saltiness, his response, priceless.. ill let the kitchen know so that when you come next time it might be better. really??? i cant make this stuff up!it was my birthday and i didnt want to ruin the night. i paid the bill and figured that i would contact management the next day assuming that they would want to compensate me in some way. no response from management or corporate by phone or email. they truly dont care about their customers, obviously focused on location, location is all that matters.the good: salad bar presentation was good. the quality was good  fresh.i couple weeks later we went with some friends to fogo de chao... awesome all the way across the board. pay the extra 3.00 and do it right at fogo.
the coffee is good, but the customer service here has been horrible. i try to keep coming back thinking maybe they are having an off day, but they continue to be rude. this time i really wish i didnt tip. i ordered a hot tea and i waited over ten minutes before i ask. i finally go up to the counter and the guy with a dark beard tells me he doesnt know he just works here and is helping out. i ask him if he could make the tea, he huffs at me, and continues to make everyone elses drink before mine. im writing this review while still waiting for my drink. dont know why im treated like this, but ill never come back.
french pressed coffee was amazing. hash browns were very over cooked, scrambled eggs had no taste, jalapeno cheddar biscuit was like a salt lick. the pumpkin bread french toast was more like big block of pumpkin seeds. our waiter couldnt remember our order and forgot to put the french toast on the bill. how could the arcadia location be so much better??? it should be the same food right? at least the waiter only charges us for the 2egg breakfast, which im sure he didnt realize.
did not have a positive experience.  took food 45 minutes 3 cups of coffee to get food and then biscuits and gravy not good at all.  other food average.  seemed to be sitting under hear lamp for awhile.  few hard workers with other staff seemed to be just standing around.  1st time here and place seems to be all fluff with no real intentions to provide a great breakfast.
i truly hate this place and am sorry that this building has to live with the existence of such a crap establishment. ive been to the over easy in far east mesa and love the food, and have never had a bad cup of coffee there. the service is awesome making the overall experience really great. we thought wed give this place a spin and after talking it up to my boyfriend, we skipped our usual visit to snooze and went to this god awful trainwreck of a restaurant.the restaurant was a bit busy when we got there, so we waited a few minutes to be seated and once we were seated we waited. and waited. and waited. several staff passed by our table, no one engaging, asking if wed been helped, just minding their own business not concerned with a table that isnt theirs. i get it, youre busy, someone else is supposed to be covering this table but theyre not. but. what is so hard about stopping at a table that has no drinks, no silverware, nothing to indicate that the customers have been approached and ask them have you been helped? one of the waitstaff had the balls to make direct eye contact with me as he was passing our table without saying a word. i mean what?? it was infuriating to be passed over so many times without once being approached with a simple have you been helped? thats all someone had to to do. the inattentive behavior of the staff showed me that either management didnt train the staff to take a team approach to customer service or that they had just hired staff who werent interested in taking the team approach. after 10 minutes of this, we decided to leave because obviously no one wanted to take ownership of our table. i asked the hostess to speak to the manager and she said that the manager wasnt there and instead directed me to one of the waitstaff who may or may not have been in charge. this totally disinterested staffer gave me half of her attention as i told her what happened and why we were leaving. instead of apologizing, even though it wasnt her fault or maybe it was if she was in charge, she gave me two coupons for a free breakfast sandwich good at that location only.  a why would i come back? b how low rent are you? and c girl please r u serious?what a waste of a perfectly good retailrestaurant space.
my boyfriend and i love to try new breakfast spots every weekend and til yesterday it has been a positive experience. this weekend i picked over easy, the tempe location....never again! first of all i went to unwrap my silverware and both utensils had food stuck to them, no worries we are a pretty easy going folks so i grab another set from the table next to us only to find food on those as well. now i am a little grossed out and wondering what else is not cleaned properly. the waitress cleaned a few sets for us so we preceded to order. i got the french toast with bananas and pecans it was okay but i had to pick off the bruised bananas, not too appetizing. my boyfriend got the chicken fried steak and we split the jalapeno cheese biscuits and gravy. the chicken fried steak was so chewy it was inedible. i have never seen my boyfriend unable to eat something, he is practically a garbage disposal. the gravy over the supper dry biscuits was also a real let down too, it was full of raw soggy bacon also inedible. not sure what part of this experience made us both sick but take your pick it could have been  number of reasons. overall a real let down. i would highly recommend anywhere else!
this the third time ive been here and theyve run out of coffee.      i qould come more often if i could bring a starbucks or something with me.the swrver was very good however the food comes out for each oerson at different times.   im done before my granddaughter gets her food  and we all know never feed a kid first.  that way they can complain and be unhappy.tried this place 5 times .... never again
terribly disappointed! their service was very slow and obnoxious. the lady waitress with black hair was looking at me in a condescending demeanour. she thought i was just some kid who didnt know their pricey meals. in retrospect, i got some really crappy food for 50. i ordered linguine with alfredo sauce gratiner because apparently they didnt have fettuccine pasta! hmmm a pasta restaurant without fettuccine option is already very bad! the waitress had no idea what gratiner was i had to explain it 5 times. the pasta was very cold undercooked.. barely any sauce and the cheese gratiner was burnt. its a real shame because the place is really beautiful with very nice interior decor. however, the food and service was so bad .. i had to wait 10 extra minutes at the door to get my order to go. i dont think of ever coming back. i just dont understand the entire point of this resto is pasta.. you should specialize in pasta which they dont at all. huge disappointment!!
this gym would be mediocre if it wasnt for the significant amount of hidden administration fees. you already charge 40 a month for a small, crowded gym, do you really need to sneak bs charges off every customer as well? id save my money for a less greedy, less conniving company.
this place is overpriced. the food was good and the service was good but it wasnt 22 an omelette good. i get that its vegas and ill pay a premium for that as well as good food but with that said, not sure it was that good. putting an expensive restaurant in the lobby of a busy casinoresort means you get no peace and quiet but an expensive bill. the decor felt like a shitty hangover where you just do it because it has to be done. would i go back? maybe only if i have to and was staying here again.
ordered the bbq rib rack for about 35. came with little half filled basket of fries and red cabbage. the rib was super salty. i was only able to finish about 2 out of the 6 ribs. its sad when the fries are the best item on the plate. other item from group:lasagna was best item on table.fish and chip didnt taste good. bit fishy.slow braised rib was decent. overall dont this place was worth it. food wasnt good and place is over priced.
screwed up our order. twice. also took 30 min for our dinner, we were 1 of 3 tables. we are staying here at ceases for the week , and it would have been very convenient to come back here, but that will not be happening. very disappointing.
this place was terrible!  website it was fresh all the time, but my pancakes were dry, tough and burned.  coffee was terrible and barley warm.  i would go anywhere else.
we tried this place cause it looked pretty nice, but i can say its too over pricy for this quality of food. and service sucks! we asked waitress for jelly for toast and he defiantly forgot about us. waited 10minutes for our receipt. and on top of that my burger of tomato had sticker on it.
waited for 15 minutes in prominent area of restaurant  completely ignored  left  avoid!!
avoid this place. yes, i said that. avoid it. its the worst of the new vegas rip offs. terrible service. food indifferently prepared and cold when served by people who just want to move on to the new table. i ate twice with the group that wa staying and both times the food and service was atrocious. you will find better food and significantly lower prices most anywhere else
the food is great, but unfortunately the service is nonexistent.  we waited over an hour for a blt and roasted chicken.  the manager was less than helpful, although he did remove the charge of our food served cold.
walked by this restaurant on several different stays at ceasars. had tickets for reba and thought lets have dinner and be close to the show. huge mistake 45 minutes to get our food with an almost empty restaurant then 2 out of 4 meals were incorrect. we sent one meal back completely, i ended up sharing my meal and the other meal was barely touched because it was basically inedible. the server apologized and sent the manager over who basically offered to comp the cup of coffee!  really! very poor service, we will never come back to this restaurant and will probably think twice about staying at ceasars palace.
i was actually interested in going here.. enticed by the discount i receive with my gym membership. however, a woman died the other day here. it irks me that some of these reviews were written that same day or the next day.. they had no idea what just happened.. stay away!!  dont believe me... google it!! :
way over priced, 695 for an outerwear vest?! rent is high, someone has to pay the bills on this dingy joint. slovenly dressed sales women.
food is edible. restroom is really dirty. didnt surprise me though. dishware  are dirty also.
service is absolutely terrible. place was almost empty so im not sure how they missed that up. had to ask multiple times for multiple things and they justin ignored. literally grab plates from other empty tables right in front of them because we were short on ours.
new place not located within chinatown, decided to give it a try. very disappointing.maybe half the place was filled when we were there, around 1:30. since it was busy and packed, wed assume the servers would have the ability to offer better service and be more attentive.we had the sticky rice in lotus leaves, crab claw, shrimp dumpling har gar, tofu skin with meat... the basics of dim sum.sticky rice fell apart when we opened up the wrapping, which means it wasnt wrapped tightly and wasnt steamed long enough. crab claws were cold and hard. har gar had clumpy shrimp in it. tofu skin definitely sat too long and was dried out.there was absolutely no ventilation inside. the irony, the food was cold but we were sweating sitting inside on a hot summer day.味道一般。食物的溫度有問題，還未上臺已經冷了。點心要有煙，才好吃。夏天那麽熱，裏面一點空調都沒有。我們的體溫比食物還要熱。
worst customer service!!!, food arent even that great. orchids garden dimsum is wayyy better. this was our first time coming to this place, it will be our last time. not worth your time and money
we were drawn to the restaurant as it was one of few in the area open at 9:30om and it appeared to be new from the outside. once inside we were immediately disappointed at its appearance but decided to give it a try anyway.  the waiter, an older man perhaps in his 60s,  was downright miserable. he took our order and was reluctant  to offer any information about any of the choices. he did not even ask if we wanted drinks. when the food arrived it was mediocre at best. rarely do we leave food behind, but the food was such that we did not want to be reminded of this bad experience again.   the utensils and plates were not very clean and when asking for more rice, it is doubtful the same  man who was cleaning up even washed his hands before he went in the kitchen for the rice. we felt rushed to get out, but seriously wanted to spend not a minute more than necessary there anyway.
the service here was horrible. 2 carts only bringing out the same old crap. will never go to this dump again. to make things worst dumb lady asks if i know what dimsum is and that theres no regular menu. i sit down and 2 carts of garbage going around and people ordering off the regular menu. dont waste your money at this dump. i think the owner was the cashier she got mad at our waitress at least but screw this place. im sticking to orchids garden for my dimsum cravings
terrible. terrible. the service is terrible. you should not have to remind the servers what do you order. they dont write anything down. only one cart for dim sum. by the time they get to you theres nothing left in the cart. i would not recommend this place to anyone
food was cold and expensive didnt enjoy it  dont want to come again thought 3 star should not be that bad ...
so ive seen this restaurant change a few times, never really been in here though, so i tried it, never coming back.so first we sit down, atmosphere is simple and very plain. it was very spacious and plenty of tables everywhere which is good. service... is debatable.1. we didnt ask for hot tea, but we got some and assumed it was complimentary but charged us on our bill.2. every time we ordered something, nobody could understand us even as were pointing at the actual picture so there was literally 3 servers trying to decipher our orders. after a while believe it or not, we had to use google translate to communicate to them.3. they dont have most of their dim sum on their menu. i had to ask what they had available instead because most of what i wanted they did not provide.4. they did not provide us with steamed rice. we asked for some but they just laughed at us. like was that supposed to be funny? so the server gave us a cup of steamed rice when there was three of us. theres charge per bowl of rice it was totally fine, i just assumed it would be a bigger bowlplate of rice like the other restaurants in chinatown serve when its family style.5. we ordered pecking duck from the dim sum menu, and they decided to cook us the whole duck. when we told them that the order was wrong she said its okay if you dont finish it, eat it for dinner tonight.......... what? so we got charged for the whole duck. the duck didnt even have flavor and they didnt give us the sauce that comes with it. 6. the pork chops had sugar on it. different style maybe? the fried soft shell crabs in the picture had three in it, but they only serve two. the server said the photographer took the pictures of the food in different angles thats why it looks more. but in reality, its smaller, so next time she said not to believe the pictures..... what?7. once we received the fried soft shell crabs they already gone bad. was not fresh at all, in fact sour. they did make us a new batch of them without charge but we already lost our appetite to eat them.8. i dont know why but the servers kept laughing at us every time we wanted to order something or ask for water. and it wasnt the friendly laugh. for the three of us it came out to 50, and we were still hungry when we left. and i left wanting to throw up too so yay even better. i understand that theyre new and that there was is a bit of a language barrier. but im really hoping that they improve on their service and food a bit more because i want to see a permanent restaurant for that location! personally i would not come back but if it improves i totally would.
i walked in at 1130 and sat down. waited to be served for 10 minutes and still wasnt being served. i got up and left. disappointed! i guess id stick with other places with good service.
great concept, poorly executed. food is prepared to order but not in a logical order  appetizers came out after the meal. fish portions are so thin that the saucedressing overwhelms the fish; fish also ends up over cooked. the one highlight was the grilled swai lettuce wraps.
im currently sitting in front of the restaurant 15 minutes before they close.  the employees ran to the door as i was walking towards it and they told me they were closed. clearly somethings wrong here. the sign on the door says open till 10 p.m. very bad service on my first time here.
wow our food took 45min to come out on a slow tuesday night. i understand that happens but an apology goes a long way! the food was good but the wait just ruined the experience and we will never return.
i have been wanting to try this place since it opened. was excited to finally have a quick fish place that wasnt the national fried fish chain.staff was really friendly and lots of smiling. great start. i ordered the cajun tilapia with a side of grilled zucchini and white bean soup. everything was cooked nicely and the cajun spice had some heat but not overpowering. there is a little condiment bar with peppers and salsas if you want. my wife had the grilled mahi with a side salad. her fish was also cooked nicely. but, as were leaving, i notice a small chalkboard listing where everything is from. only the mahi is wild caught and according to seafood watch, not even in a sustainable country. i assumed my tilapia was safely harvested in an american or canadian farm, but it was not. even the salmon is farm raised and nearly everyone knows farmed salmon is brimming with antibiotics and added hormones.letdown.
worst customer service ever you can think off, in any chain! i went in with my work stress to feel better and also to eat healthy as i was in that area , this may be my second time to this store first time to this location dont remember!anyway but story starts here,i had salmon in mind so i ordered whatever i saw with salmon , no introduction of food no explanation, they hand over me slip with waiting number but it was useless didnt  know what it is for first , later on when i breath properly , i asked them what other options are which i would have gone with if they greeted me nicely and explained more about the menu and when i went out on call, they waited until i came in to prepare my salad .i asked salad 8 lady replied there are so many 8 in rude way, uhhhhh... wow...... are working over here. i had to go and pick up another lunch because option i choose was unfortunate.no wonder they had to put up label that we are working on our customer service to better serve you!!!!!!!no need to mention that what i got in salad is few greens and small piece of half grilled salmon , forget to take picture because i was feeling low on sugar my intention was to eat anything.i work in area there are so many better places if you spend more then 10 , that will make your day at work.i never care to post on yelp but today my frustration with service i got is sky rocket.
i found a hair in my veggie pita in the first bite. i called to get a refund and the owner was angry when i told him we threw our food away. he offered to give a refund after a bit of arguingredients over the phone.
food is decent but service is very very slow. we ordered items and never got them. some can out 30 minutes later. some didnt come out at all. when we asked about them the waiter totally had forgotten about them. she kept saying im sorry and blaming the cooks. sad thing about it is the place isnt really busy. as i sit hear typing this review i am still waiting on my order. waiter came by and ask if i want ice cream yet i havent gotten my prior order of shrimp tempura ordered 15 minutes ago. what a joke. never again. dont come here if your hungry because thats how you will leave. slow and poor service.
not sure what happened with the staff but most of our orders were forgotten.  we had to reorder them.  the food was good but it felt like a hostage situation waiting to get all of our dinner for over 2 hours. two parties left their tables out of frustration.  i am a pretty patient person but i started getting uncomfortable and embarrassed just only having drinks and nothing to eat in front of me for so long.  even with nothing on our table the staff didnt bother checking in with us to see if we got our orders or wanted anything. to make matters worse it was a birthday dinner for my partner and i felt awful. i wont go back to this place.  i dont normally review places but the service here was just so bad and a waste of time.  if you do go here youll probably enjoy the food but just make sure they dont forget about you.
i went to this sushi place because of its high reviews. i have been to a ton of different sushi places in vegas over the last 5 years and these reviews absolutely do my match up to what it should be rated. the food came out 1 plate at a time and took forever in between plates. the restaurant wasnt that busy and the food is subpar as well compared to many of the other options in the city. this place offers almost the exact same menu as sakana. sakana is top 2 of ayce places in vegas for sure. unfortunately will never eat at sushi way again. staff was nice though.
i would give zero stars if i could,we went there on a wednesday night, by friday morning everyone who went all had the stomach flu virus, which isnt a flu at all, but is cause by bacteria found in contaminated foods.we were all sick, throwing up and all had diarrhea, i am never going back here again! either someone in the kitchen is not washing their hands, or they are not prepping their foods properly!! stay away!
just called this place to ask a few menu questions and was instantly hung up on. well fuck you too sir! ill take my party elsewhere!
ordered from here for lunch today.  got super white tuna, miso, seared tuna, seaweed salad and fat ass roll. they gave me no wasabi and no utensils, and no napkins. the food was gross. inedible. i only ended up eating the miso. everything else was too foul smelling and disgusting. waste of money. wont be back.
ive been here a few times and while their baked goods and cake shakes are good, their service is abysmal. dont come here if youre in a rush or on a lunch break. one of the workers, the blond elderly lady, messes up on the register every time she rings you up so someone else then had to fix your order so you pay the right price. my cards now have the security chip so youre required to insert it inro the reader, both times when i tried to use my card, their card reader didnt work and they said they didnt know how to run the card. the attempts were over a week apart so they had plenty of time to figure it out in between. the last time i went in today, for a sandwich, cakeshake and a mini cheesecake for my roomate they handed it to me without a bag so i had to try to balance everything while in a rush because they made me late by taking over 20 minutes for an order that should have taken 8 minutes tops. i cant tell you how it was and my roomate didnt get her cheesecake because the balancing act i was forced to try to juggle fell. the lid of the shake wasnt on securely and popped off in my car so i have to get that cleaned out before it cooks too much in the 100 degree summer. what a waste of 22, im not going back and dont recommend.
so sad.  we were very excited to see a cute new shop in the shopping center.  could not wait to try them.  found them on facebook and saw that they sell cupcakes.  we got four different cupcakes and two cronuts.  unfortunately,  i have to say these were the worst cupcakes i have ever had.  we got one nutella and could only taste a coffee flavor in the huge amount of frosting and the cake was really dry and flavorless.  next,  was the cinnamonchocolate hot cocoa way to strong in the cinnamon and again cake was dry and flavorless.  third,  was caramel apple and it had a weird fake flavor and the cake was terrible.  last,  was chocolate chip cookie dough it was the only one that i thought was just okay.  the cronuts were in the hot cocoa and strawberry, the strawberry was okay, but way to sweet.  i think the prices we paid 23.00 for this order were very high for cupcakes, but if they were outstanding i might see paying it.  i will say the customer service was great.  sorry to say to repeat customer here.
this review is for the rainbow location.i walked in two hours before closing just looking to check the place out. i told the guy what i wanted and asked him to help me with sizing. he was a complete jerk, he wanted me to pick a different script, when i had told him i wanted this uone because it was important. he turned the small three worded tattoo i wanted into a huge 160 piece. and treated me like i was a complete idiot. its my first tattoo, im looking or a little guidance here. his name was darien. i left really mad because he was making me not want something that ive wanted for a long time. so i walked out and drove down the street to living dead and was given exactly what i wanted by great people within 30 minutes for 60.the people there said that this is not uncommon with diversity. please do not go there.
first time i went in to get my lip pierced. the lady pierced it wrong, got mad at herself then pierced it again. it was so obvious she got nervous after that because she was freaking out. there was so much blood it looked like a crime scene. recently i walked in to get a septum piercing, the guy couldnt get the piercing in the first time, so he pierced it the second time, nothing. three times the charm, he finally gets it in. but the placement is super low and it looks weird so i took it out. i do not ever recommend this diversity location, the workers are inexperienced and unskilled. what a waste of time, money, and pain.
this place is a joke and a hot mess. its like whoever owns it just grabbed the first stoned teenagers they saw off the street with some piercings and tattoos and asked how theyd like to just hang out in the shop all day and get paid for it. i was wary of checking this place out to begin with just from the reviews alone, and i should have just trusted my instincts. i walked in just to look at some jewelry, and the place smelled so dank. i dont care if you smoke, but i also dont care to get pierced or tattooed by someone who is visibly stoned and blasted. second, nothing about this place is sterile. they have the jewelry sitting in dusty cases, and when i asked to see their styles for my smiley, she brought out a little baggy that she proceeded to ruffle through with her dirty fingers, no gloves on, and asked if i needed help putting it in. she just assumed i was gonna buy it after it wasnt in any sterile packaging and after she handled it without even washing her hands and with no gloves on. their prices are average for your run of the mill tattoo shop, but for these guys, thats paying too much. im aware there are other diversity shops around town, and ive heard mostly positive things about them. this one, however, is an embarrassment. avoid it all costs. go somewhere clean with experienced artists and save yourself the trouble. i was in this shop for all of 5 minutes and the staff and facilities just left the worst impression.
worst japanese food ive ever had! starting with the wierd lady who served the food...shrimp sauce was more like sweet and sour sauce it was red instead of the normal orange yellow color..soup tasted like hot water..food was extremely bland..the only decent thing we had with the entire meal was the sweet tea. we definitely will not be returning!
the people are friendly, but the prices are way too high for the amount of food given  at least on the sushi side of the menu.
this restaurant was not very pleasing the didnt have my hot sauce the steak didnt taste all that great they did try to fix it which was good but still left a bad taste in my mouth i probably will not return to this restaurant..
gave this place two tries. the service staff is friendly, but the food is not good at all. hot and sour and wonton soups are bland at best. i tried shrimp and pine nuts and mongolian beef, and i would not recommend either. a friend ordered teriyaki chicken which looked great but did not taste good. my guess is that the cooks are not tasting the food before serving to check quality. a disappointing experience for a restaurant i had high hopes for.
terrible! the expensive calamari was so chewy i couldnt even get through a single piece, the chicken was unbelievably dry and the sauce that came with it made my stomach hurt, and the pot stickers tasted like they were frozen out of a box soft and bland. never eating here again!
really?  ordered brown rice and was given white. when reminded them that i ordered brown rice i was told they ran out. so my husband is halfway through his meal. why couldnt we be told it would take a little longer instead of plopping what i didnt  order on my plate.  bad service and no offer to comp meal that was delivered late. food is good but thats crappy customer service in my book.
this is possibly the worst meal i have ever had.  i dont even know where to start. it was fairly crowded for a sunday night which i took for a good sign. the wait staff is young but fairly attentive.  our actual waiter was a bit of a dope and more concerned with the table of 5 chicks in his station. appetizers. we ordered the chicken satay. super sweet and basic. we also ordered the spring rolls. completely ordinary.  meals. eggplantpork dish. i thought i was going to wear it home. the waiter literally almost sloshed it off the plate and in my lap. i just ended up with a gelatinous spill on the table.  it was so sweet it was almost inedible. yellow curry was actually edible. pho was probably the best option but not near as good as my favorite pho joint. 50 but not my last meal. bummed. was hoping it might have promise for my new watering hole.
worst customer service ever!wow! buyers beware! false advertising...do not buy here!model  700696color cappuccinolength 60depth 18height 24.5price  8.1 sales tax 299.99about: this premium entertainment center features a tv console and two media towers sans connecting bridge, for an artistic floating top look. the console features a raised platform for your television, underneath which are sleekly designed drawers and shelves. each media tower boasts two bottom drawers and four sturdy open shelves, for an efficient yet dramatic effect.  i called and asked if the product was still available...lo and behold twas available but the 2 towers are not included!  but it clearly says in the advertising that the tower were included...the person i spoke over the phone claimed to be the owner and sternly said that the media towers were sold disparately...he said it was only my interpretation the person i spoke with was very condescending and arrogant! wow!!! best scam in town! i gave one star just for him promptly answering my call...

we went for lunch on a weekend and they charged us 15 for the buffet. the food isnt worth the price. there was only one starter and the vegetarian options werent good.
i have been waiting for a dosa since 1 hr and when ever i ask them they say 5 mins.worst service
i showed up for the lunch buffet. waited at front podium for 15 min with no help or offer of table.  so i left.
one of the worst restaurant i have been to. poor and rude service and even worse food and selection. i would not even think off visiting this again. friends, stay away from this place.
food is decent, services is horrible,  i run out of coffee and one lady passed  by and ignored us completely and did not ask us if we needed more coffee
horrible service. i have gone a couple times already, and 1 every time the servers are very slow. 2 they dont know the specials and then fight with you when they get it wrong. 3 also, i took about an hour for 1 burger to come out when tables around us were served food faster. 4 no one knows where the bottles are located as it tool 15 min for a bottle order when there were 2 tables occupied. overall, 10 tip or less.
okay so today, 71115 was my first time at the brass tap and i just walked out! i am beyond disappointed by the service in addition to the management! i live less than a mile and will never return! dont waste your time!
service is awful...went in sunday around 6.30 and it wasnt too crowded.   hostess said we could sit wherever, so we sat right next to the door outside.  we proceeded to sit for 10 minutes while wait staff went by and were never checked on or given menus.  finally my wife went inside and asked a manager for a server, which we got 5 minutes later.  the beer out of the tap was leukwarm.  we sat with empty beers for another 5 minutes and finally gave up.  we actually had to go inside to request to pay.  we live a block away and are unlikely to go back based on other reviews in yelp with the same experience.  there are too many options around south end for this place to last once the newness novelty wears off without very drastic improvements.
i really want to like this place, but the staff makes it so hard. i work in the service industry, so i know how bad it stinks to receive an unwarranted bad review about seemingly good customer service, but some of the females here have been some of the rudest individuals i have ever encountered at a barrestaurant. one even went so far as to scream at us because their friend was unhappy with a member of our group? wheres the professionalism! however, the 1 star is being given solely for the great beer selection and decent food. outdoor patio is nice as well. i guess my one recommendation would be to just teach the staff a lesson or two on professionalism, and to maybe not say everything that comes to mind. some of the staff is great though, i do want to make that distinction. ill probably return, as long as we arent kicked out at 12 again when the posted hours clearly state 2am. we get it, you dont enjoy a slow night, get used to it! thats the industry.
first time here and last.  they only serve brunch on saturdays until 2:00 pm. asked for a fried egg on top of the hash and they said they could not do that.  who cant make a fried egg?  very disappointing and will not be back. also, loud loud music.
the staff is horrible. had a friend anonymously send 2 girls a drink and the bartender told them they were on him. ask for house vodka and was charged for grey goose! will never go back.
that service was s.......l.........o.........w.......  ugh!  beer flight was ok. cant blame the bar for one of the worst beers ive had, but their waiter.  wow. 7 tables on patio and it took at least 5 min before he saw me and went for a menu.  they must bury them in a basement closet because it was another 3 min before he returned. promised napkins and silverware when dinner brought out.  never delivered. beer flight was gone thru half the meal and never offered another. finished meal and say for another 58 min before he acknowledged me. got the bill and left. good was o.k.  nothing to write about.
terrible terrible service. i went with a large group and it took us an hour to receive waters and another hour to get our food. the server complained to us that there were only two servers for the entire restaurant and that they were slammed, with no real apology. we asked if we could get an app or something to make up for the two hours that we sat there waiting and hungry and they responded with blank stares. the food wasnt even anything special. there are so many better options within a short distance that its really not worth your time. horrible experience.
the food here is over priced, and down right not good.  i ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant, and a fruit salad.  the hot food took less than two minutes to make.  normally, being fast is a good thing.  however, because they simply zapped it in the microwave, the sandwich was too hot, and completely diminished the quality of the the entire thing.  if they toasted the croissant, it would have tasted delicious.  the cheese was located all in one section of the sandwich.  i would get either bites of egg, bites of cheese, or bites of bread, but rarely, would i get them all in the same bite.  the fruit salad was even more disappointing.  the quality of fruit selection was great, but the cuts were comparable to that of a five year old cutting them.  all the bad pieces were at the bottom where no one could see.  what a huge let down.  i will not be back.
0 start. the place is dirty, filthy, full of garbages. the manager doesnt seems to care, or actually he does care about the pictures i am taking. the cashier couldnt take our order until the person in the kitchen was back from the toilet!!!!!  oh well i guess this is burger kings way to care for their customers.
ive been here three times. i dont know why i come back. there is only one sushi chef behind the bar and it takes sooo long to get any of it. god forbid another customer comes in then its twice as long of a wait. my miso soup was cold tonight and despite what rolls i ordered, they kept giving me deep fried rolls. i dont know what was happening but i wouldnt have paid 26 ayce if what i wanted was long john silvers.
this is the worst sushi i have ever ate... i dont even know if i even like sushi anymore. decent prices but you get what you pay for!!! 5 thumbs down!
just dont go there.
came here with high expectations, but my friends and i left dissatisfied. we came to what seemed would be a nice dinning experience on a weekday and boy were we wrong. i have never experienced such horrible service! it all started with the waitress, she had to repeatedly confirm our order because she didnt write it down correctly. we all did all you can eat and seriously need to consider changing their name to youll never eat sushi being that our entire order was coming out one by one every 2025min or not coming out at all. we had to ask were our rolls were at several times and all we got was that they were coming. the restaurant was not busy for them to be that slow especially when there are four people making the sushi. one of the orders i placed in my first round came two hours later. you can tell the other diners were upset as they also would ask what was taking so long. we even had to ask for the waitress to refill our waters as they were not doing that either. im not the type of person to complain, but i was sure livid! but what made it worse is that they didnt even seem apologetic even after i expressed how upset we were. she was like yes the kitchen is slow. really, that is all you can tell me. i must admit the rolls were good but definitely not worth the wait. we were there for over three hours and asked to speak to a manager since we felt that we should get a discount for what we had endured. but no manager was available. i was ready to walk out of that place because supposedly they could not even offer us a discount or just simply an apology. im not the person to just walk away and not pay, but was close to it after we finally continued to dispute our bill and got them to give us some type of compensation which we told her we would only pay them what we feel we should pay or walk out. ill never come here again and would suggest you think twice about dinning here!
the worst service ever in sushi! im a sushi fanatic and  the sushi was horrible! with very bad service. extremely slow i mean very slow! energy ora vibration extremely bad! maybe  rating this restaurant 110 is a negative 10 extremely bad!much love n aloha.  star rating
i went to oh my sushi about three days ago. if i could just give this place a review and no stars i would. i came here with my boyfriend because yelp said it was highly recommend. it was a big disappointment. when we first stepped inside the place only three costumers and we can and about an hour after they open. there sushi looked appetizing from how they describe it on there all you can eat menu. sadly when the food arrived on the table and finally get to see what the buzz was all about i felt betrayed by yelp. there sushi was bland , dull, and my last order of sushi looked disgusting. it looked like someone had poured pepto bismol on my sushi. i noticed while at my table they have bribe yelp users to rate them well by giving them a free drink , beer, and a mug. never going back i wouldnt even eat here if it was free. i suggest going to sakana or yama sushi instead i promise you it a thousand times better then this place.
absolute garbage services offered. if you must go do not sit at the bar, they will ignore you; you must flag one of the sushi chef down to order. the server will refuse to take your order and insists you talk to the chefs. one of them was an old man who spoke barely any english and the other seemed to just work there this past month. my second time here and both times i walked out on them without having my fair share of ayce.
it was a midnight showing on 61215 in 3d. i watched jurassic world. it got so hot in the theater, that my clothes got wet. i was so uncomfortable. it started with my seat were occupied.  they must have over sold them. no explanation for it. we ended up getting the handicapped seats. it was better than the one i paid for. we were not the only ones that had that issue. i looked for help, after the show was over, but not one employee was around to inform. just needed to tell someone, so i am telling the world to be aware of this experience. thanks for listening.
renovations are great but that alone does not fix poor service. my wife and i were there for a 10am film. at 10:10 i went to the snack counter and advised the young lady behind the counter that the film had not started yet. at 10:20 someone came into the theatre and from the back of the room announced that due to a fire alarm before the place opened, the film was starting late. no kidding !no sooner the managerial person left, the movie started. but alas no volume. again a person came in and announced that they were working on the problem. again no kidding !so the movie actually started 45 minutes late. we were offered movie passes as compensation. thank you, i am sure my wife and i will use them one day. but being that this is las vegas, there are other options for places to go when seeing a movie. no kidding !
remodel is nice, enjoyed the reclining chairs. i hope you dont have any customer service issues, because they dont care about retaining your business!
have been to the newly remodeled theater 4 times now, and i would recommend only if you dont mind paying twice for on line tickets and spending far too much time on the phone and email in an attempt to have the duplicate charge reversed they still have not reversed the charge by the way! the visit prior, we were charged 6.99 for the first showing instead of the 4.99. had to spend a good 30 minutes at the box office to have that corrected! the staff is friendly and the prices are great if you are charged properly! i recommend buying your tickets at the box office if you do visit because the company clearly has no clue how the on line operates and they do not show both charges going through even though my bank acct clearly shows both! very frustrating and a waste of time to save a few bucks, definitely not worth it. if customer service reads this review, a little professional advice, if a customer has an ongoing issue for 1 month, transfer them to a supervisor!!!!! dont offer to do the same exact thing the last customer service rep promised and failed to do! please get your on line dept together, your customers would greatly appreciate it, assuming we will remain customers! : im doing 1 star for the friendly staff that hopefully gets a raise from all of the over payments myself and other on line customers have more than likely made!!
i have always had nothing but problems with this movie theater before and after the remodel. before the remodel the theater was poorly managed, plagued with constant bathroom floods, poor sound quality and was run down. after the remodel the bathroom problems still exists and you cant really get a seat unless you order it on line hours in advance. knowing that the theater was going to probably sell out and i wanted to see star wars on my one day off a week; i ordered tickets on line. once i entered the movie theater and was purchasing the over priced concessions, i noticed a line of people at a register close to the exit but didnt think nothing of it. i proceeded to the theater room and noticed it was completely empty. i walked back to the theater entrance and listened to a young girl saying that the movie ticket i purchased was an sff sensory friendly films made for autistic children that included a lower volume and some deleted scenes. wtf??? are you kidding me? i cant see star wars like this and enjoy it. these type of movies are generally played around 10 am on a saturday not on the weekday before xmas at 7pm. i have no problem with supporting the handicap, but 7 pm on a weekday evening with one of the most popular movie to date....are you kidding me? there was nothing online showing that this movie was going to be in sff format when i ordered it online. as i go back to the front im now starting to realize why there was a line at the front inside register. the sold out show didnt have a single person inside the theater because everyone demanded their money back. people ordered online just like i did and it was never listed as an sff showing. so here i go waiting in line with other frustrated people, some who had children dressed in star wars attire, some who had to get babysitters for their night out, all waiting to get their money back. just like me this theater ruined their evening out. one customer even purchased their tickets 3 weeks in advance. my girlfriend was at the concession getting her money back for the over priced snacks, and i was in another line being asked if i would like to return for the 11pm show. i quickly said no, this was my last time ever coming to this theater. i just want my money back and thanks for ruining my one day off a week when i just wanted to enjoy a movie. this theater thought it was more important to have an empty showroom and upset customer, then to have a room full of happy paying customer. thanks again amc rainbow promenade, you will never see me again.
staff extremely rude and unprofessional i learned that when speaking with charles the night before then after meeting him next day made a very inappropriate comment. would be worth the extra miles to go to another mazda dealer then this one!!! 2 weeks later after purchase still not driving my car due to they cant so,be warranty issue!
in addition to falsemisleading advertising you can add liars to the list. sold me a car with an outstanding factory safety recall that was noted on the carfax that they had possession of and never made available to me till after the fact. never had the car smog as required and didnt find this out till after spending 3 hrs. at the dmv trying to register the car. advertised as fully inspected with new brakes only to find out that only the front were new and the rear brakes were actually  down to only 10. despite all this was willing to accept their promise of compensating me for the cost of having a second keyremote made but that turned out to be a lie. what a surprise ?!  still waiting for that check...............please learn from my misfortune and buy somewhere else.
the 1 star is for the service department. i usually get my oil changes done here every 3000 miles. im not sure why oil changes usually take over an hour here regardless if its a weekday or weekend.  the average time of my oil changes done here usually take a little over an hour and a half.well today was no exception.  i booked my appointment online for a 1:30pm appointment on a tuesday afternoon. usually i get peter as my financial officer and he usually checks up on me and lets me know when they are a little behind.  instead, today i get tim, who didnt even check up on me until it was time to pay. 2 hours and 20 minutes later, tim lets me know at 3:50pm that my car is being washed and that he will come let me know when to head outside. unfortunately, i never see the guy again and instead run into peter which i let him know of the situation. 2 hours and 50 minutes later, its 4:20pm and im driving out of the service department. all this time for a standard oil change that doesnt even include a tire rotation.
at first we thought the salesman shane jonathan wellman, was all comforting and that we were gonna make a great deal. total lies, and then this went on for a whole week back and forth and wasting our time and our gas. and so today we thought hey one last time, and if not then we get our money as a deposit back. woah, lies again, you only get half back  then the sales manager jeff was extremely rude and unprofessional about handling the situation. no wonder they only have 2 stars. jeff was so rude, he would cut me off when he clearly asked me what the mix up was. excuse me, that im trying to tell you what is wrong  you cut me off rudely.
donc. nous sommes arrives la parce quon avait vraiment tres faim et quattendre 30 minutes pour avoir une table pour dejeuner, thanks, but no thanks.le staff semble vraiment etre juste tres confus  pas organise. une fois attable, on a attendu beacoup trop longtemps avant de voir apparaitre le serveur. ca nous a laisse le temps dobserver le decor hyper aspetise, possedant autant de charme que la salle dattente dune clinique medicale mais avec plus de pots de chocolatle serveur etait pas attentif, a passe tres peu de temps a notre table malgre que le restaurant etait a moitie vite. les plats, quant a eux, etaient ordinaires une gaufre chocolatbanane, tout a fait acceptable mais aussi memorable quun dejeuner de chez cora.passez votre chemin.
they just opened. so do with that information what you will. that being said, this is one of the most disappointing and downright awful dining experiences ive had in quite some time. my coworkers were taking me out for a fun friday lunch before i leave on a long vacation, and we were looking forward to trying this new spot. we got there at noon and were seated without a wait. by the way, its freezing in there. i dont know if that matters to anyone and its a personal preference but thought it was worth mentioning, it was quite uncomfortable after awhile. we ordered our drinks and an appetizer, the gnudi, which was quite good, 30 minutes later. i wish i could say that the service was good and the food was bad, or vice versa, and that there was some silver lining, but unfortunately it was just one thing after another. i never got a refill on my lemonade after asking our server upwards of 4 times, our appetizer dirty plates were never cleared, my friends used iced tea glasses were never cleared, new ones just kept appearing, the list goes on. our food finally did arrive 45 minutes after we sat down, and this is where things really get bad. i ordered the big sexy burger, and i had asked for it cooked medium. not only was it rare, but it was raw inside. my friends mushroom flatbread was supposed to be vegetarian as she doesnt eat meat and she specifically asked for no bacon, yet it was covered in bacon. it also wasnt a flatbread by any stretch of the imagination, it was more like a small puff pastry tartlet. obviously neither one of us could eat our entrees, which was disappointing as we were starving and had waited almost an hour for them. i had to physically get up and go walk to find our server and tell her that we had a meeting to get to and couldnt wait for our food to be fixed, but she insisted that my burger would be remade and i could take it to go. its sitting in my car going bad right now as we speak, as i am in said meeting and did not get to eat lunch. the manager did come over and apologize and comped the meal, unfortunately we all left quite disappointed, and very very hungry. it doesnt seem like a good place for a business lunch or a weekday lunch, as i dont see how anyone could ever get in and out of there in an hour, and the prices seem quite outlandish for the quality of the food, service, and overall experience.
if i could leave a 0 star on this place i would!! this place is a total joke...we came in and my friend had a juice he was finishing so they wouldnt allow him to bring it in! we were ready to spend 100 here and they rather lose paying customers over 5 juice?!? what a joke!! i have a business and would never treat my customers this way!! stay away from this place!!
2nd review because therapy convinced yelp to remove my first...ate beef tar tar likely cause of hardcore food poisoning. left me on the toilet for days and i would have been hospitalized if i didnt have many natural remedies.. liquid bentonite clay, kombucha tea, 50 billion 24 strain probiotics,  bee propolis , royal jelly, copious amounts of pink salt water for electrolytes, when my stomach finally calmed because of kombucha i began to be able to hold down some liquid ..i then became bed ridden with insanely ridiculous back and kidney pain and unbreakable fever left me in a pool of sweat  for 2 days. explosive vomiting over 35 times and diarrhea. massive fever as well by far the sickest i have ever been.. now 1 week later i have a severe cold coughing green phlegm incessantly for days.. important to mention  have not had a cold or flu for over 2 years previous to getting poisoned by therapy.. i now wish i went to the hospital to gather evidence against them.  the reality was i felt too sick to get myself to hospital any way..these mammalukes are trying to cover up that they are getting people deathly ill.. lets see how long until they convince yelp to pull this too..my friend who i ate with also got insanely sick. but not quite as bad as me.. he only puked and diarrhea for 12 hours or so. i guess thats what you call a lucky therapy victim..now for rhe food.  beef tartar lacked seasoning was super bland and one dimensional.. crispy pig ear is a gelatinous mess which is then coated in a thick batter and deep fried. a mushy and crunchy texture that kept my stomach turning for days just thinking about it..charcuterie board is a total joke. super thin pathetic and definitely not unique selection of sliced cured meats which could be purchased from any deli. accompanied by some standard pickles some mustard and toast points.  no one could make rillette, pate, lardo, brasaola something? that would be too much work apparently easier just to buy a meat slicer and purchase deli meats from grocery store. absolutely zero creativity. empanadas were the only item we thought were good but not great.service was decent at the bar however had to ask for multiple water refills. and when we inquired about wines by the glass we would have been better off asking a chimp.. i want to be clear  i am not basing my food opinions on any part of the fact i got deathly ill.avoid this place like the plague unless you do not value your life. especially, keep away elderly or children as they would not survive a food poisoning like therapy gave me..last review therapy had yelp remove it.. if my massive food poisoning didnt now turn into an awful cold i probably wouldnt have bothered to rewrite this but thanks to therapy and unlucky for therapy i am now sick in bed again with lots of free time.
went here for a lunch outing with a company i worked for during the summer. it was a few days after therapy opened in july. i drove by therapy this morning and was reminded of my awful experience and felt compelled to share. i walked by therapy a few weeks before the lunch outing and heard dead kennedys california uber alles blaring from their doorstep at 11 a.m., so i had a positive initial impression. our party of close to two dozen was seated at a long table in the back. the decor was wood and metal and the kitchen was open which added to the homey, comfortable vibe. two waitresses were taking care of us. i looked through the menu with my vegan lenses and narrowed it down to three items; a salad, a flatbread or a side. i wanted something filling with a variety of flavors so i decided on the summer squash flatbread and ordered it without cheese. i informed the waitress upon ordering that i cannot have meat or dairy and she said she was nearly certain my order would suit my needs, but if there was an issue she would let me know.the entrees came out and the waitress informed me the dough for the flatbread contained dairy. since the entrees had already arrived, i asked her what other menu items i could have. she frantically looked at the menu for a few minutes and suggested the mixed greens salad without parmesan. i didnt want to waste any more time so i agreed. i was pretty disappointed since i was looking forward to something filling and toothsome. i remembered i had stashed a trusty and incredibly tasty trader joes 3.99 vegan bbq chicken wrap in the fridge at work the day before so i was less annoyed since i wouldnt have to be hungry for the rest of the work day. the salad was the most pathetic plate ive seen in a while. half the plate was empty and the salad was dressed spring mix and a few radish slices. the owner came by after i had a few bites and asked the group which dishes everyone enjoyed. people replied with this and that and he asked one of my coworkers what he thought of the mac and cheese. im lactose intolerant so i couldnt try it, he replied. the owner said with a chuckle, well you dont matter. i saw a few people look my way and the owner quickly walked away from the awkward silence after his comment. i was taken aback and frankly insulted that a restaurant owner in downtown las vegas would say that customers who cant eat dairy dont matter. even as a joke. the absence of vegan items, besides some overpriced spring mix, made a lot more sense after his comment. by no means do i think they need to do a menu overhaul. the dishes that came out looked very creative and fun like the red velvet waffles and chicken, but in a neighborhood where you can get various dairyfree lattes, vegan nachos, vegan pizza and vegan donuts asserting people who cant have dairy dont matter is asinine.
two words: never again.we sat at the bar for brunch at 11:45 on sunday. not because there were no tables; there were only two parties seated at tables. as a bartender, i just prefer the bar. its  a more relaxed environment all around, and usually, bartenders are more engaging. its like youre a guest at their home.not at this place.the first sign was when i asked a question about a particular drink. the response, you and i are going to have very different palates.ya think?the tone would be offputting coming from a server with a french accent at french laundry on a saturday night; much less a bartender on fremont street before noon. with two ballgames on the tvs behind her, yet. i was a little disappointed at my 5oz wine pour  but hey, i figured theyre watching the bottom line, going by the book, so i had no right to complain... until i saw a solid 8 oz pour go to a person at the other end of the bar, and then 2 more to diners at a table, that the server picked up at the servers station. at that point id finished my glass, so i had no case to make.speaking of the server, he got a serious talking down to by said bartender not once but twice in front of us. he handled it quietly, mindful of the fact that we were sitting right there. if this was constructive criticism, it was disguised as pure condescension. and we should not have been privy to it at all.there may have been a manager on duty. if so, he was purely on top of operations; never once came by to ask how we were doing. he did stop by the couple a few seats down from us, upon whom the chef or someone from the kitchen also spent a great deal of time chatting. even the bartender seemed to enjoy their company, because we saw her smile while doting on them note: its great when friends come see you at work, but never good form to have two distinctly different personalities: one reserved for friends and one for everyone else.lets talk food. kale salad was fantastic. its hard to make kale tasty, and this was a solid execution, in terms of flavors, textures, and presentation. the chicken meatballs were okay. the jalapeno pesto made the dish. the mushroom flatbread... i knew that this was not the way to go when i saw the flatbread was in fact puff pastry. but the flavors sounded so good, we went for it. and the flavors were terrific. but a rich, soft topping of mushrooms, egg yolk, etc. needs the sturdiness and crispness of a proper flatbread to make the dish work  not a buttery, delicate puff pastry that gets weighed down by the toppings.ive been to eat, carson kitchen, and park many times, for any combination of great food, solid service, and fun atmosphere. with all three nearby, there is no reason to return to therapy.
had the oxtail empanadas, chicken meatballs and chimichurri steak and they were all subpar at best. in addition to mediocre quality the food was way way overpriced. i will not be back.
stopped by today and they are no longer there!
this was my worst experience ever with a nail salon. this has been my second time coming here and im very unhappy. first off the prices are way too high. i purchased a fill at 32.00 which is originally 27 at other nail salons. my nails are unsymmetrical, uneven and not smooth at all. also i was cut twice and bled. this place is by far the worst experience i have ever had and i will not be coming back.
i have to say when u first time be there u will feel comfortable and think they are so nice. but after u found you didnt get any result from your zerona treatment u should talk to their doctor. he will tell you u already sign on the paper which write they dont guarantee your result. its means u throw your money! if no result its none of their business! right now im trying to find an approach of law!
real steemer carpet service, first thing is i should have never used a flyer and second is i should have used a carpet cleaning service that had at least spelt steamer correctly. i had set up a cleaning service a week in advance with alex he took all my information and even repeated it back to me. the day came and i had even moved furniture out of the way so it would be quick and easy for them. this appointment was set for 8am as i had a flight to catch. well 8 became 8:15 then 8:30 when i finally got a call back after two messages that i had left for them. when they did call me the person that called didnt even say he was calling from real steemer he said  yeah you called? i have a missed call from this number it wasnt even the number i had called so i had to question him as to what or who he was. so once i figured out who this caller was he said he would call me back , which he did rather quickly ill give him that. now i was told that it would be 9 and someone would be there. ok still benefit of the doubt needed to have carpets done and catch my flight. the person i talked to never introduced himself never apologized and never offered a discount. i am waiting for the tech to arrive to clean the carpet. we will continue the review.........
no call, no show, no good. someone called to confirm the appointment last night, but unfortunately failed to show this morning no phone call to let me know theyre running late or anything. when they finally showed an hour and a half late they wanted to give me a more expensive price than they quoted me! bad business.
one star.  yes, thats right.  i went in for a quick bite on my lunch break.  714 4:48 pm.  i ordered tacos.  brown rice, black beans.  i still dont eat meat or dairy  i wanted lettuce and the famous guacamole but, they were almost empty and the lettuce had drops of sour cream and the guacamole had shredded cheese in there.  gross.  yeah, i know cross contamination is bound to happen in restaurants but this is just unacceptable.  so i left with just rice and bean soft corn tacos and some salsa.  i drove back to my desk ready to dig in and low and behold: the rice is not cooked all the way.  fml.  im starving.  im crunching on the rice as i type this.  i doubt i will ever go back to this one again.  the dinner rush hadnt even started yet.  i cant imagine how thats going to go down.  uncooked rice.  im very disappointed chipotle.  one star!
the customer service is friendly and the portions are pretty reasonable considering how most chipotles are very light handed. the problem here is the awful smell of some chemical lacker of some sort when you walk in the front door. the aroma is awful and very overwhelming. i reported it to the cashier and he just said he couldnt smell anything great help. i also get very annoyed about how you order salsa and theyll only fill the cups halfway. hello, two half cups of salsa costs you more in product cost than a full cup of salsa.
what happened to this place?.. first time here at new location. .. when you first walk in.. there is a horrible stink.. the whole place smells. . cant stand it.. original location was never like this. also tables are filthy. . floors have food all around.. this new place is so tiny.. they really gave up alot moving. .. food is ok.. sad to see that my goto place is worse now.. ill have to search for a better location. ... wow this place smells..
very disappointed. i lived in morocco for some time and have been craving good, authentic moroccan food. with high hopes and good reviews, i finally went to this place. aside from the fact that what we wanted was ignored, the food did not taste good. everything in my couscous tasted overbearingly of bad tomatoes. what i ordered shouldnt have even had tomatoes. the couscous was clearly not made authentically either. i guess ill continue my search for real moroccan food...
whoever hibs is bought this studio suddenly and now will not refund the unused portion of my prepaid card for classes at yoga unlimited. their website explains this as heated to 8085 degrees which they claim is necessary to warm up your body though all my previous teachers explain that this what the ujjayi breath is for. when i told the new owner i do not like heated yoga they responded, this isnt heated yoga  so are you lying on your website or to me directly? either way i didnt dig the vibe as she said it was just business. no namaste here apparently. oddly, hibs stands for holistic integration of body and soul  my understanding from a few years of practice is that yoga inherently is the holistic integration of body, mind and soul  so in naming this place hibs they are essentially calling it, yoga yoga but without the integration of mind.  its too bad they decided to leave the mind out of their process  they may have realized the benefit of taking care of customers of the previous studio and probably wouldnt have ended up with such a silly name.if you like studios that use goofy marketing ploys and lie to you to get yo in the door, this is your studio.
i ordered at 6:24pm, food should have been at my place at 8, but didnt arrive until 8:24pm. i ordered a burrito, taco, fries, and wings. the fries were lukewarm and not all were edible cuz they were cold.. and anyone whose eaten cold fries knows theyre disgusting. the burrito was ok, didnt have the cheese like i paid for. now was gave it 1 star are the wings. they still have fucking feathers in them!! are you kidding me?!?! needless to say i trashed them and did not eat a single one. idk how this place has 5 stars. i will never order from here again and im glad i bought through grubhub so that i could get all my money back. 2 hours for this. feathers... luke warm food even though its in a warming bag. ridiculous. disgusting.
i placed an order this morning for a delivery. after an hour, i checked on the status of my order, and was told that it was out for delivery with the driver. an hour later, i received an email, saying that my cancellation request was processed, and i will be refunded in 23 business days? i was then told that the restaurant has no drivers for the day, and therefore is not making any deliveries. extremely frustrated, and will be taking my business elsewhere.
i ordered beef with spicy garlic sauce. the beef inside my order was very chewy, spongy, and just the weirdest texture. the color is bland and just not right. it looked ok before i pulled out a piece and washed off the sauce before i realized... ok, what am i eating? take a look for yourself and you tell me if your eating beef. lol but they do have a nice staff in there! the cook might talk on the phone while he makes your meal with one glove.
im only writing this review because i tried with this place 3 different times.coffee coolatta experience the first time i went there was to ordered the coffee coolatta.. my girlfriend and i had to go around the drive threw 3 times before i gave up!!!! the coffee was all watery all 3 times and they claimed the machine might be broken.. i just said whatever and drove off.the second time was a 2 weeks later and the same problem..the third and last time was last week, where my little brother, girlfriend and i got the coolatta and again.. a fail for us all..started going to the starbucks across the street!
so my boyfriend and i drove to this location after the one by our house was out of everything... literally.  this location sucks just as much!!! dunkin should just close down all there locations. the girl in the drive thru was the rudest person ever with an attitude about everything. my bf ordered 6 hash browns to which her response was 6 hash browns, oh my god are you serious.  she then made us pull forward and wait and still forgot the bagels we ordered, had an even bigger attitude about having to walk back inside to get them.  dunkin really needs to teach there employees about good customer service.  also itd be nice if you always werent out of everything!!!
always out of blueberry muffins. also no glazed donuts at8:30am wow what are they thinking poor management
in the neighborhood, so though id give it a try.  alz had a valleywide coupon for a free coffee.  ordered my donuts and asked for my coffee with the coupon.  despite the  valleywide designation on the coupon, they wouldnt take it saying theyre a different franchise.  wake up!!!  the two other coffee shops on this corner were packed and i was the only one in duncan donuts...now i know why.  glad the franchise owner has enough money to chase customers away.
i went there a few weeks after they opened. the food dim sum was decent, but the service was poor. we didnt get our food until 45 mins later. they charged us 7.00 for a bottle of miller lite, i think thats extreme for domestic 12 oz beer. seems like the waiters and waitresses were confused and were not sure what we order, we ended up not getting two of our dim sum orders. we were told the kitchen recycled our paper where we placed our order...lol. after our first time with poor service, we wanted to give them another chance. we went back a week later and this time the service was even worse. we sat at our table for a good 25 minutes, no one came and asked us if we wanted water or even gave us the menu. we decided to leave the place. until i hear the service has improved, i will not waste my time and money at this place.
my husband and i have been together for 38 years and have eaten a variety of oriental foods in a number of countries, states, towns and cities. never have we had a worse one. i ordered seafood fried rice and got a plate of white sticky rice with nearly invisible pieces of what purported to be seafood, each about the size of a newborns ring finger fingernail. my poor husband ordered sweet and sour pork. it was literally inedible, consisting of nothing but grizzle and bone. service was slow and the woman who was a friendly hostess worked in a booth behind ours sneezing and coughing her way through readying silverware. a horrible but memorable experience. we will certainly never forget it!
i order rad bean jellyo. it tastes like plastic! and the price are too hight. general tso chicken charges ¥14 .  the restaurant gets rid of us.
food is just ok. maybe 3 to 3.5 stars. kind of salty, which is not what dim sum is supposed to be. youll not need soy sauce at all as they make the dishes very salty. service is bad. no star at all. they brought a dish we didnt order along with 2 other dishes we did order. later they brought the 2 dishes again and realized the error. what surprised me is that they altered our ordering sheet to include the dish we didnt order. at checkout, the owner insisted that they didnt change anything on the paper, but we are pretty sure what weve ordered. thats just dishonest and disgusting. she did admit that one dish was put in incorrectly, and offered to give me that one for free the next time. next time? hell no more. the same owner also owns a chinese restaurant on state street. sneaky biz practice there to charge 18 tips regardless of the group size. similar tactics here that group of 5 or more will add 18 service charge.
my grandchildren and i threw up right after we got home from nani.  we all had upset stomach.   it was our first time there. there were chunks of fat in all the dim sum we ordered.  it was kind of gross.   if you are the chef of nani reading this,  please cook healthier food for others.  food poisoning is not a joke.  im feeling very disgusted thinking about your food.
worst customer service ever!! i was the first customer of the day and when i got seated other customers were coming in too. i finished my ordered and told the waiter but he just walk pass me and went to help chinese speaking customers first! they had like 4 waiters yet no one came by and they just greeted customers they knew. theyre more friendly if you can speak their language! i waited 1 hour to finally get my order in and waited a total of 1 hour to get all the food i ordered even though there was barely any customers only like 45 tables. the food is expensive for the portion you get. only come here if youre dying to eat decent dim sum.. will not plan to eat here again unless i am literally dying to eat dim sum.
i actually want to give minus five star! im from hong kong and my wife is from beijing.  weve had our share of chinese food.  after going there for our first time, my wife puked and i felt like puking.  she suspects the oil and the meat is not fresh.  you can tell they heat everything with the microwave.  the tea taste weird too. also the price is more expensive than very good dim sum in chicago! please shut this place down because its not safe!!
terrible experience. the restaurant chair broke, hurt my friend, and tore a hole in his pants. not only did the owner not apologize, she actually was angry about my friends complaining about it like its my friends fault. ridiculous service, avoid if possible.
food was ok but service was terrible! check was put on the table even before we finish our food, the owner doesnt want us to pay with card and said it would take a long time if pay with card, she kept asking us to pay with cash even when i said i dont have enough cash embarrassingly! my friend had to pay for my food in the end! they better wish that there will not be a second dim sum restaurant in madison!
i came here because they had told me that the 10 yrs 100,000 miles transfers over w the car brought here because the check engine turned on and now they tell me it does not and to just check whats going on in my car they charged me 130 dollars for doing absolutely nothing
one misleading and dishonest dealership that should be avoided. purchased a used 2010 honda element from them on july 7th this year with an advertised promotion of a no cost one year subscription to siriusxm satellite radio. all i ended up with was a trail 3 month subscription which expired oct7th. attempts to get the to honor their printed promotion has lead only to additional failed promises of the  check is in the mail .  do yourself a big favor........shop somewhere reputable for your next car!
really, really wanted to like it...........but was a horrible experience. after custom built on grand canyon and flamingo closed down last year, i was really looking forward to a new buildyourown pizza place to replace them.similar to pieology, you can add as many toppings as you want for one price, 7 per pizza. similar to pieology, it is cafeteriastyle. not alot of personality on the walls, pieology at least has some fun quotes to read while you wait for your pizza.first, they dont hand toss their dough, so the crust was just okay. they were predone, maybe even frozen?? didnt see a dough press so might be the case and the resulting cardboard crust.sauce, several options to choose from, the marinara was okay.here are the two big issues and why i will not waste my money by going back:1. they dont have a pizza oven, they have something similar to quiznos  a conveyor style rack that heats the pizza and melts the cheese. how can you possibly expect good pizza without a real oven???2. unlimited toppings. i wanted pepperoni, mushroom, peppers and jalapenos. i got 7 pepperoni even after asking for more please, exactly six mushrooms, scant amount of sliced peppers and five jalapenos.how disappointing. i didnt even get a bite of each topping on each slice. wrong place to be skimpy guys, wrong place. especially when you advertise unlimited.i will have to keep looking for a good custom built pizza i guess.
i love this place  ive been to alot of nail salons but this is the best... i like that they take the time they do such a great job definetely i will be coming again12915so i went back today like around 6  because my nails were very long i was not able to work... at the beginning they tell me that it was going to be 15 even that the price was  25 but at the end of all they began to speak in their language i do not understand the language but i dont need  to they were very unpleasant to me started making my feel like i was asking for something free they start doing everything in a harry it was a very bad experience i end up telling them to charge me the  25 because i dont want a bad treatment just because of the money at this moment i dont feel like going back to do my nails there anymore....
the guy that owns this company is an unlicensed plumber named dani yacobof. he jumps around from state to state scamming people by either not finishing jobs or causing very costly damage. in new york and maryland, hes worked under the company name jerusalem plumbing. he stole parts, materials and tools from my house after improperly connecting a water heater and creating a life threatening situation by not properly venting it. dani also damaged other pipes while in the process. to top it off, dani claimed he was too sleepy to finish the job and would come back first thing in the morning to finish. dani never returned and never answered phone calls or returned messages. this after actually receiving significant payment in advance. this guy is a thief on all levels. dani is short, stocky, egg shaped, has black hair and walks like a troll. i have pictures of him if additional information is needed. beware! he also has used the following phone numbers: 9173747587, 7029453664, 3477337999, and 9176407770. if you are crazy enough to take a risk with this guy, at least ask him to show you his plumbers license up front as well as documentation regarding all this warranty crap he claims to offer. its all lies! ask him to show you this stuff, youll see.
would not recommend!!! went here to get lash extensions and had a terrible allergic reaction! swollen, red, painful, itchy eyes. i called to have them removed immediately! the salon was booked and couldnt get me in to have them removed!!! i asked if they could stay past 7 and remove them and they said no! the gilbert location offered to squeeze me in but it is an hour and a half of drive time to get there and back so i am scrambling to find another salon closer to remove these.
dont waste your time if you want any semblance of an actual starbucks. literally no products for home purchase and they dont accept starbucks rewards cards.
there is a female barista that is really rude and unpleasant every time i stop here... you can tell she just down right hates her lifejob and takes it out on customers.  i thought maybe it was just me but friends and family have also complained about her poor people skills.  im really disappointed because this place is extremely convenient however, with the limited availability of normal menu items and the terrible experience time after time, i think im about done with this place.
i want to support this place because there are few easy healthy options in the area, but when it takes 1520 minutes for 5 oatmeal in the morning and are late for work because of it, i cant justify coming back. i dont fully blame the guy working because he might have been understaffed,  but everyone else seemed to get their food on time. oh well.
horrible customer service. i was completely ignored, as the staff talked to themselves, so i gave them a couple minutes while i stood there. eventually, i left and went to another business. normally i would give a new business the benefit of the doubt, but i was the only customer there and didnt even get a friendly hello. probably wont be going back.
i would have appreciated if the guy behind the counter last night would have told me that the broccoli cheese soup contains raw cashews in it as its base. after being in the emergency room for 5 hours last night because of a serious nut allergic reaction, i called this morning to find out the ingredients of my meal after the fact. what a miserable experience. thanks greens  protiens.
i thought the location would mean a nicer store. i was wrong. ill start off with the layout of the store: terrible. its as if the designers were trying to make it as difficult as possible to get around. the quality of the products is also terrible but i guess you get what you pay for. the worst part of this store and winco in general is the quality of people that shop there. ive never seen a more inconsiderate, lazy, and obnoxious group of people in one building. between parents with six kids running in all directions, and the penny pinchers dragging 3 carts behind them, its impossible to maneuver my way around to get the 4 things i wanted in the first place. considering its a new store, the same people stand in the middle of every aisle trying to decide where to go, oblivious to the fact that they are in the way of other people in the store. if you care about your health or the sustainability of the food youre eating, i dont suggest going anywhere near the meat. many of the egg cartons we looked through had at least 1 or 2 broken or missing eggs that we later discovered broken on the floor of the cooler. and off we go to check out: there were three cashiers open with lines at least 8 carts long. having less than 15 items, we went to the self check out lane. out of the six brand new registers, three were having problems. the two attendants were running back and forth between all of them. the sensors on the bagging areas cant seem to recognize when items are or are not placed in the bag. it would have taken less time to stand in line with all the full shopping carts than it did for us to get through the automated glitches. moral of the story: if you want to buy a years supply of chicken nuggets, cereal, and macaroni  cheese for your six kids with food stamps, then this store is right up your alley. otherwise, i suggest paying a few cents more per item, earning fuel points, retaining your dignity, and shopping at frys....or safeway...or albertsons...or sprouts...or trader joes...or even walmart, yes, walmart. any option is better than this store.
super disappointed! i went to winco off bell rd and 11st last week and got a money order. i did not need to use it so since i live in the west valley and it was past the 3 day limit they have to exchange it back then i went to this new location. my son was attending his class around the corner so i stopped in with my 2 young kids. i stood in line at the customer service desk and their was a guy in front of me with ice. he was greeted and helped then i was next. the lady did not say one word to me and gave me weird looks. finally she said do you need help. um obviously, im standing in line with s cart and 2 kids in it. i proceeded to tell her that i needed to turn in my money order and she asked if i bought it there and i told her that i did not, i bought it at the other location. she immediately said she cannot help me and i can only turn it in at the location i bought it from. on the back of the money order it clearly states that it can be turned in at any place that has money gram. i told her what it said and she got very rude and would not help. at this point i turn around to walk out embarrassed, i was crying, i needed to get this money because i had no cash and needed diapers. i did not have enough gas to drive 50 minutes one way just to turn in a money order. when i got to my car i called the other location that i purchased it at and they said it can be cashed at any winco as long as its past the 3 days. i am truly disappointed in the new location and how they treat their customers!!  i will not return
no credit cards accepted? huh? what century are we in? this is a major retail store right? anyway, the employees here are terrible. yes, i know you have a job putting the fruit away and i am sorry i made you tilt your head to look at me but can you atleast point in the direction of the body wash instead of the head move and a good old over there. i like low prices just like any other person but when you make a customer feel insulted by the actions of your employees then its just not worth it to me to go back. its not like it matters though, walmart is still in buisness and they are the worst with service so i see this company and its shitty emloyees having a long life without me.
for what its worth, heres my input on your new store in surprise, az. its a disaster.  i just returned from my fifth shopping trip to the store at 9:45 a.m. on a saturday.  not many customers.  i know some of the reasons: 1.  why would you have a fork lift on the floor at this time of day going beepbeep so loud it was very offensive?  whats wrong with a silent pallet jack?2.  for goodness sakes, turn down the volume on the p.a. system.3.  try to buy a watermelon.  none last wednesday, none on saturday.4.  dry produce looked ok but wet produce looked like walmart and thats not a complement.5.  twice i have found the seafood section unmanned and customers waiting, looking for help.6.  in five trips, i was greeted by one employee and he may have been a manager or assistant. the checkers are not greeting customers nor do they thank you. sign me,just an old grey haired senior, but there are lots of them in surprise just like me.
hey this place look nice. but the place is a shithole.service department sucks. you have to talk to a manager to understand whats going on to your bike. and they have my bike for 5 days. still can fix the f..... problem. if my bike is not under warranty. i wouldnt come here....this is after i spend 2300.so if you need to get your bike fix or service it, and then i recommend you take it somewhere else.
we were so excited to see what this place was all about. walking in, we were the only customers. we were treated very kindly but man alive, even my teen mentioned that the music volume was crazy loud. we kept having to lean forward to hear our cutie pie cashier. it would be great if the employees could explain the menu better than just tell us the 1 ordered drink name. we didnt even understand what the jelly bead things were all about and the concept in general. the workers should be energetically sharing everything, finding out flavors we prefer,  and offering samples even. we didnt like that we couldnt get a decaf tea in our drinks. youd think that would be an option. another employee kindly came out and offered to use water instead of tea, which we went ahead to do but really, why not decaf teas? fyiwater vs tea still does taste good go figure. as our drinks were being poured into the blender containers, a new customer walked in and instead of them just greeting her and finishing our drink, the mixer gal left that post and took the other customers order even though there was an employee that was in the back that could have done so. i found that unprofessional that our drinks just stood there while the customer read over the board for awhile, asked questions, then they mixed hers before finishing up ours. then, instead of our 2 drinks being done first, the gal behind us got hers. i questioned the apologetic employee about that as well. we received our two drinks however they were two totally different sizes. i pulled my receipt to show we paid for the same size. yes, they fixed it but again we had to wait and this time the place was very busy. we walked out with three drinks in hand and guess what? our replacement larger drink was still wrong. they forgot to just use water instead of tea! that totally changed up the flavor and is of huge concern since we do not use caffeinated drinks for health reasons. needless to say, we didnt bother telling them of yet another mistake and just tossed it. we were disappointed in the drinks flavors we ordered overall. honestly i think its a texture thing for us. if you are a texture person, the bubblesbeads will probably mess with you too. getting a sonic drink, a bahama bucks, a smoothie, or whatever is a better and more economical choice for sure. again, nice employees, way cool cups and straws, but more training on customer service, teaching how to educate the customers, turning down the music, and adding decaf selection would be way better.
im still in shock. i just watched the barista drop my cup on the ground, pick it back up, and make my coffee. disgusted! taking this all the way to the top!!
they have a real problemtried to have breakfast there and was told there was a 30 minute wait although there were several open tables they said kitchen was running slowi am not impressed they are going to need to step it up if they plan to succeed as for me i will not return
the place was clean and the staff friendly. the food however was a different story. i ordered the corned beef hash and it was awful. the potatoes were cut too large and the meat was simply cooked brisket perhaps from the bbq next door. the bloody mary bar that greets you when you enter is just plain weird. the decor is sterile and unappealing. never again unless you like surreal experiences.
this is the worst experience i have ever had at a restaurant. we found this place a few weeks ago and were so eager to try it out. safe to say i will never be a patron at this gimmick of a restaurant.our experience this morning was similar to larry k.s review. however, we werent even given a wait time or a chance to be put on a guest list. the answer was simply, no, we are full, even with three empty tables in sight.in the middle of arguing with the hostess  an older white haired lady  to try and figure this mash out, a middle aged woman  entitled soccer mom looking lady who claimed to be the owner; shes not  tried to jump in to resolve the situation and ended up trying to reprimand my boyfriend. heres a tip: youre a new restaurant. every customer should be equally as important to you. plus, you should understand the whole situation before you jump in and assume the worst of people. i was a hostess for six years. when there is a wait the first thing you tell the patron is the wait estimate and then you offer to put their names on a guest list. this is fundamental and was not communicated to us. you cannot blame a patron for getting upset when we asked for this information several times and were just told the restaurant is full.first one star review ive ever written. well deserved, hash kitchen.
wow!  we were treated so rudely by the hostess that we will never return. it was a sunday and 2 hostesses were working.  it was the woman with the gray hair and black and white striped top.  we came in and were not greeted nicely, but told that there was a wait unless we wanted to sit at the bar.  we were happy to wait, standing patiently and quietly, looking over the menu.  after about 15 minutes the hostess approached us and said it would be another 15 minutes at least, and was not very nice about it.  there was a table set and unoccupied since we arrived, and several others waiting to be bussed.  there are lots of places to eat in scottsdale, and if the first person you encounter in the restaurant acts like she doesnt care if you eat there or not, my feet and recommendations to others will patronize other establishments.
ugh. the note below is probably why your restaurants are always empty.you did not understand the situation. you asked me no questions about why we were getting frustrated and did not give your hostess a chance to explain the situation to you. you merely interjected when he came up to the counter upset and then you dismissed us with zero apology. what kind of customer service is that? i might have expected that from a shift manager, which is what i thought you were based on your behavior, but never a restaurant owner. what my boyfriend said to your hostess was she didnt even offer to put our name down. valid complaint. was his tone the best? probably not. but we expected basic service which you didnt deliver. you, mrs. restaurant owner, are the one to blame for not training your staff well. your actions were ruder than both my boyfriends and your hostesses actions. unacceptable. we were willing to wait. like i said, we were excited to come try out your restaurant, but we were not even given the opportunity to wait. where was the wait time? neither you nor your hostess gave me that until i had to ask several times. the fact that you had two similar instances within the matter of a few days should tell you that there is a problem with your service. larry probably wanted to wait as well but was not given a chance. service complaints are so easily rectifiable. your hostess has had three similar complaints on here in the last two weeks. train your staff.finally, way to go and get your friend, yvonne, to write a review about your restaurant to counter mine. very professional. just like your response. zero friends, two reviews, the other one for your failed restaurant, cuttlefish? nice try.people  dont waste your time here. you can get a better bloody mary cart at the henry. a better breakfast at butterfields. and better service anywhere else. this plaza for example: soi 4, chez vous crepe, pomo, naya... hell, i will even go to pei wei. youre in a spot with a lot of competition, lady. step it up. again. one star, well deserved.
why must creativity trump execution excellence?  the menu reads well, but taste is disappointing.  the location had me doubtful, as the former cuttlefish was pretty slow and sad.  to my surprise this place was pretty happening, perhaps if food which is priority to a restaurant was made well, it can truly succeed.  service wasnt all that either..  had high hopes as it seemed to get high marks.
just had the chorizo frittata and it was just ok lacked flavor. i was expecting way more from this place and it did not deliver. coffee was very good lavazza. service was ok but noting inviting. the server just delivered the check and did not ask if i wanted anything else. they have donuts! oh boy! think outside the box! lol basically i wouldnt come back to this place and i dont recommend, unless you like tasteless food and donuts! lol dont waste your time, plenty more to choose from. i like the concept but they fail at implementing it. high priced dennys. you got one star for coffee...
second time here was a cluster. the front staff was very unorganized and unprofessional. i was told our wait would be 15 minutes. they proceeded to seat people that arrived after we did. we waited 25 minutes i finally asked the hostess and i was told the owners doctor got precedence over us. that is the last time i attempt to eat here.
i came here the first part of august and found some great bottoms and tops.  store was very busy, tons of help and best of all they did a flash sale, 3 bottoms for 100!!  today i came and it was horrible from beginning to end. to start, there was a football game but other than traffic i really didnt think parking would be an issue.  they tried to charge me 10 to park which i flat out refused to pay, even after i was told it could go towards my purchase. i parked for free. upon entering the store i was greeted and told where the sale items were. i went to the racks where the pants were. not only were they very ugly outlet store they were all priced at 89 or more. seriously not much less than going to the normal stores and getting great merchandise. the help wasnt any better. in the back they were dancing and all the others were having private conversations.  oh and did i mention that i was the only one in the store. it was pretty pitiful.  im not real sure if ill ever be back.
we booked a foursome for early in the morning 8 a.m. and arrived before our tee time.  after checking in we asked where we could get a coffee and some muffins to take with us and were told there were none.  no kitchen service until 11 a.m.  really?  then we asked when the beer cart started and were told there was no beer cart for the course.  really????  our breakfast choices were snickers, mms and peanuts.  seriously, we cannot recommend this course because these are basic, everyday expectations people have when they go golfing  food and drink service!!!!we eventually got fed but it was after our golf game.  as for the course itself, all cart paths are dirt, bathrooms are portapotties and the greens and fairways were just ok.  this is a duffers course with zero oncourse service.  bring your own food and drink for the duration of your game.  we wont be returning...
so im at the mall tonight with my family and we see this new burger joint called he burger factory.  if you know me you know i love burger...period!  so i eyed the menu out and was going to get the mushroom swiss burger.  the problem was there was no employee at the register.  i stood there for about three minutes and still no employee.  into the third minute i saw an arm.....and then a mop handle and then the employee.  so she kept moping and im sure she saw us.  the problem was she continued to mop.  now heres the dilemma.  i really wanted a that swiss burger but i came to my senses.  if your customer service is that bad am i going to get a good burger from this place.  ill try to come back another time maybe during the day when the employees are a little attentive.
my burger was great. the service was slowish, but not too bad. youll definitely have a little wait here its not fast food. the big thing for me is that my food was undercooked. i ordered a side of onion rings and received four rings, three of which were cooked. between receiving such a small portion of rings and biting into one to find out it was raw, i was pretty disgusted at the end of my meal
i am rarely one to complain, especially about airport food, but this italian bistro sandwich is possibly one of the worst sandwiches ive ever had. if the soggy, thickly cut white bread masked by the name sough dough doesnt turn you off, the herbed mayo slapped onto the outside of it definitely will  and earn you a few crumpled napkins. if you dare to continue, ignore the mediocre cold cuts inside and just eat the side of chips. not worth it.
horrible!!!! just horrible!!!!  the tech, cory, came out and said the problem with my water heater was probably an electrical issue, not a plumbing issue. as a result my home warranty company called an electrician.  the electrician took one looked at my water heater and said the tank was the problem, not an electrical issue. the electrician showed me where the tank was all rusted and explained that the actual wiring was fine, but the tank could not be rewired.  i called coyote plumbing back and they told me that my hot water tank is solar and they dont fix solar hot water tanks.  i tried to explain to their secretary, debbie, who finally returned my call after 2.5 hours and 3 messages from me that i have 2 hot water tanks 1 solar, 1 electric and the problem is with the electric tank, hence the electrician being called.  debbie insisted that both of my units were solar and there is nothing coyote plumbing could do because they dont handle solar water heaters.  mind you when i initially called i total debbie at least 4 times i had both an electric and a solar hot water tank and i did not know which tank was the issue. debbie told me that that would not be a problem. she did say that if the solar unit was the issue they would probably need to send a different tech out. at this point, i am on hold with my home warranty company waiting for a solar water heater plumber to be willing to take my claim none are willing at this point.  coyote plumbing is still telling my home warranty company that both systems are solar so my home warranty company will not allow another plumber one that might actually be able to help me that deals with electrical hot water tanks to come out.  tomorrow morning it will be 3 days with no hot water.  i also lost a day of work and i had to pay a service fee for a the tech to come out.  they just seemed to want to argue with me rather than actually listen to what my concerns were.  i am still at square one with my issue and still not heading in the right directions thanks to coyote plumbing.
in competent employees. not able to get drinks correct. employees arguing because they dont know which drink is which. food was not in kfc standards. ordered 2  5 fill up chicken strip and received 3 tiny pieces of chicken 2 inch sizes dry and shriveled!! what a joke! second box had 2 small 3 inch strip of tender shriveled and hard and one tiny bone in drummette!! wtf! ended up ordering more food elsewhere. lady in drive thru unpleasant. did not offer me any sauce and gave only 1 spork for 2 mash potatoes. i guess they expect us to share the spork. horrible experience!! went to this brand new location since its close to mtn edge. will not eat here ever again. come to this location if you want to donate your money to them. enough to feed a bird. 17024005641 sarah who oversees the restaurants.kfc website has a contact page to voice your complaint. hopefully it gets back to the corporate office.update: left a message yesterday with sarah and made a complaint to the corporate office. corporate contacted me after 2 days and sent a voucher. sarah finally contact me after a week and half after corporate contacted her but it was too late for apologies as i had voiced my complaint to corporate. i told her it was pretty sad that it took her so long to return my call. i see why this place is a joke! dont waste your money here! go down the street to raising canes where food and service is always great!
went here one time and got the family meal for 20. when i got home there was no cole slaw or gravy for the potatoes. i drove back and explained what happened, i asked the lady esmeralda if i could have an extra gravy for my troubles. she scoffed at me and said no its 1.30. im not opposed to paying but was grossed out at the lack of any customer service.
ive been to this location twice. both times bad! this last visit..my son ordered the 5 fill up after his football game he was hungry ..got 1 drum stick and one small wing. suppose to have 2 drumsticks in it...the phone number on receipt is 2815694640 and website here says 2815614640.. nobody answers.. and why is it a texas phone number?? it is a business in las vegas!! i used my debit card...they charged me a 39 cent fee for it..and could have used it as charge for free... but they didnt ask me!my fries were like hard crispy sticks!  never again!
we came in for lunch mid week. we didnt order any sushi, just a couple items off their a la carte menu. the korean bbq beef and a bento box with chicken teriyaki. the chicken is all dark meat which i personally think they should let us know. 95 of japanese restaurants use white meat for their chicken teriyaki. the korean bbq beef was overly sweet and the beef texture was a little off. like it was sitting in the marinade too long. the service was really slow because it was just one server for the entire place. we ended up paying 28 bucks for a cheaper cut of chicken and beef that sat in their marinade for a really long time.
i went in here and it took them awhile just to assist me first of all. second of all, i asked for a miso soup to go and the cashier gave me a very rude response and thought it was odd that i was ordering it to go. lastly, it took them 15 minutes just to get me the miso soup to go and they werent even that busy. dont think it shouldve taken that long. will not be going back for anything.
i was all excited to go to this new store.  they say it is the first outlet location in the country.get there and its mostly outdoor furniture.  mostly no full sets though.  and tons of bar stools.  there is also a little bit of this and that, but not much.  worth the first trip to see but definitely not a second.  but the worse thing was at check out.  we found this cool rug for 50.  normally it would have been 200.  we were about the 9th one in line, there were 3 cashiers.  it took over 35 minutes to get checked out.  i knew the line was moving slowly so i went next door to home depot to grab a few things.  and when i got back we were still 4th in line.  the cashiers were allowing the ones ahead of us to exchange some items, to look at new items matching some selection that some woman already had.  i thought when you check out, your selectionsshould already be made.  this was ridiculous.  had i been by myself, i would have left.  there were a couple people who did just that.  when we got to the cashier who was very friendly, but,  oblivious to the groans going on in the line.  paid cash, and thank god that didnt confuse her, she knew how to make change.  and we got out of there.  never going back.
what a disappointment. do not waste your time coming here unless you dont mind scratched, dented or dirty items.  we live 2 hours away, received an email this outlet was opening and we were so excited as we order from frontgate quite often and like their products.  the store is huge but in total disarray and the only items i could find in perfect condition were the packaged sheets, towels and bath mats. there may have been some bar stools that were not banged up but by the time i got to that part of the store i was so unhappy by the offerings that i was more than ready to leave.i couldnt believe that they would have rugs that were dirty and moldy on the showroom floor! this is a highrent area and with a store of 36,000 square feet, we expected this to be like every other outlettype store we have shopped.
this place was a waste of timewe got there at 7:30 walked around a little and as i got towards the front the gal asked me if i needed help i said no thx just looking. she then stated ok well just so you know we are closed.wowunbelievable i was taken back at the rudeness of the employee never again will i shop there
hi welcome to portillos! try the salt its great! we can even give you a beef sandwich or fries to go with that yummy salt while we prepare your tasty salt bombs you can wait ............................over............there, yes by all those other people, listen careful for your number, and please dont sit till we give you your food, no matter how long thats going to take. i couldnt wait for portillos to open and after lunch today i feel i was duped!!! it wasnt the plentiful and polite staff, or the disney esque big top meets roadhouse interior, it wasnt what seemed like reasonable prices, or even the hoards of crowds most restaurants only dream of.alas it all came down to element number 1, the food. i had a hot dog with everything. this shy dog wasnt too shy with the celery salt, it completely over powered all other flavors. as for the texture of that barker it was so soggy the bun seemed to drip off, and the peppers so tough i had to take them out of my mouth. the pickle on it was far bigger then the frank that just seems like reckless pickling!my beef sandwich was amongst the worst i have ever had, the meat was dry and mealy, the bread was lame, crunchy on the outside and almost as wet as the dripping hot dog paste bun on the inside. what struck me hardest was the massive dose of salt!!!! yikes i even like salt. i couldnt get back in line and wait twenty minutes to try over, so my lunch today hit the trash can!!!!i may have caught them on a bad day, it was certainly a busy one, but my first try will be my only try. there are better options around town and with less circus!!!
i honestly didnt care for this place in chicago but i figured i would try it out. not only did their food suck like usual..they got my order completely wrong. needless to say.. i will not be going back.
anxiously awaited the big opening and finally went. not impressed.while sitting and picking through the food that we got, we overheard a female manager picking apart and employee! right on the dining room floor at a few tables away from us. she wrote him up, suspended him and we overheard her disappointment in him. poor form lady. wouldnt an office or even the outside patio be more appropriate? it was embarrassing for the employee, her and the restaurant.
let me start by saying i was introduced to yelp, august of this year while vacationing in seattle. it made a great vacation better by giving me directions and ratings of restaurants in an unknown territory. thank you yelp.unfortunately, for my first post, i must comment on a most unpleasant experience i had today at portillos hot dog. ive only heard rave reviews about this chicago iconic hot dog palace, so i had to try it for myself. i decided today would be the perfect day since i was having company over for the game. i drove to the tempe market place location from south phoenix, ordered, paid and picked up my order then headed home.to my disappointment, items i ordered were not included in my take home package. i called portillos and explained my situation to the lady that answered the phone and she said  let me get my manager and placed me on hold. when the manager got on the phone , i explained my situation to him stating i ordered items that are not in my bag. the manager asked me for my receipt number so i told him. he then asked me to hold while he checked on it. he returned on the line and quickly apologized. he then asked do you want to come back so we can make it right? i said no, i live too far to come back! did i mention there was a charity run going on in tempe. this is important because the normal three lanes were shut down to one lane for traffic making it a nightmare. the manager then said, not very kindly, then what do you want me to do, i can contact our corporate office and they can send you a coupon. at this point i felt the conversation was not going in a good direction, so i said thats ok, i dont think ill be returning. the manager then responded then there is no reason to continue this conversation. so i said  youre right and hung up my phone.maybe next time they are fronted with this situation, they might offer to refund the money for services not rendered. just a thought. i wasnt asking for anything i didnt pay for just what i did pay for. in my opinion, this is poor customer service.
although i enjoy the food and service from the chicago area, the service at this location was horrible and i will not be back! thankfully the scottsdale location has good service, so i can still get my fix. the people at tempe were rude and mindless robots forcing you along and not answering questions. furthermore, they spoke over us when i tried to explain how we wanted our order as if reading from a script.  apparently in the rush to open, they forgot to train the staff how to respect the public that pays their wages.
i loved portillos when i was a kid living in chicago. when i heard they put one up in tempe, i couldnt wait to go stuff my face. instead i felt ripped off. 17.75 for a combo beef sandwich, 5 chicken tenders, and a small drink. there wasnt much beef on the beef sandwich, the tenders were tiny, barely larger than a mcdonalds mcnugget, and standing in line again just to get a refill of iced tea from behind the counter? forget it.the food was decent tasting but i couldnt believe they didnt have any sauces like ranch or bbq for the tenders.  i wont be heading back unless i hear that they lowered their prices or doubled their portions.
nothing about this place appealed to me. there is a large crowd for sure but i cannot figure out why. food lacks taste and character as does this location.
the most impressive thing of this place is the size of the restaurant and how packed it was.my experience though was far away from great.i ordered a hot dog the lady who helped me said it was their flagship dish an also ordered a cheese burger for my companion. i also got cheesy fries.after a long wait because they wrote the wrong number in my order no apologize, effort to make up, anything i told the people over there two times that i thought my order was the one that has been sitting there forever. they called the number again and finally gave it to me.the styrofoam cup for my drink make me start thinking that that place wasnt as great as ive heard but i continued to my table. i mean, im not a tree hugger but styrofoam is a little too much. when we arrived to the table i opened the bag and i saw that the burger was also in a styrofoam box. i mean, even one of the public enemies, the one with the golden arches, quit using this s!t like back in the 80s, ayfkm, portillos?now the food. the hot dog was totally uneventful and super small super cheap as well, but i didnt want to make the line again.the burger also forgettable as well as the fries.after posting on fb that i wasnt impressed, some people told me to try the beef sandwich.i might do it and might update this post.not impressed at all.
i had been told these guys are like the innout of hot dogs. and the hot dogs are good. everything else sucks, especially the service. the burgers are mediocre at best, the chicken is terrible. and if they make a mistake on your order, they will not rectify it. theyll promise you theyll mail you a gift card, but it will never show up. when you check on the status, theyll tell you theyll look into it, but again, thy wont. save yourself some money and get better food and service at innout.
bad drive through service, the cashier repeated my order wrong and then dropped my debit card out of the drive through window. my french onion soup was awful, salty and flavorless. i dumped it out of my car window after a few spoonfuls. no idea what was floating in it, rubbery cheese and tasteless bread. the hot dog was edible, at least. i will never go to portillos again.
hate the place. walked in and left. the food looked totally processed and the ambiance, crowd and everything about this place is revolting.  confirming i dont like chicago style food which is why ive taken up cooking my own food.  sorry guys who love this place but just givin my opinion.
went there the 2nd week it was open and it was beyond bad.i figured i would give it a 2nd shot but sadly they need to close this hole down.food is overpriced and poor quality, staff has a we dont care attitude and the management seems to think they are all gods who are there for you to worship and not help the customer.why do people post good reviews about this place and rave how great it is when it is pathetic..wake up people you are getting ripped off by this waste of space...
i do not have good things to say about this overpriced drive thru.  i dont get the obsession with it.  the food is not good.  i have had 3 salads they all sucked.  how you order through the drive thru is weird.  there is no speaker they use their employees to stand there in the drive thru to take your order.  they hand you a menu and wait for you to decide.  its so uncomfortable i would just drive away but my husband was driving and he is so much nicer than me.
from 1977 2 1998 i lived in bolingbrook illinois, few years later in the 80s portillos open a restaurant there. they served vienna products and were the top dog and polish sausage anywhere. in 2003 i moved to arizona, at portillos moved in a year or so ago . i was thrilled at first because as i said they were the top dog in chicago area. well obviously here in arizona that all came to a stop. the products they serve now are garbage no longer vienna here in arizona at least not sure about illinois obviously to save a buck , and the dogs polish beef are no longer the same. i can get a better be hot dog a polish sausage at chicago land hot dogs in mesa, they use high end vienna products like portillos used to. dont let the conglomerate that is now portillos take your money for an inferior product.
stay away!  the food here is worse than pig slop.  we had a chili dog and an italian beef sandwich.  the presentation both sloppy goopy messes was absolutely awful and the taste of the food was even worse.  this was probably the most disgusting meal ive ever had anywhere.  you can get a better chili dog 12 mile down the road at weinerschnitzel and for 13 the price.  the fries were just like the ore idas you buy frozen at the grocery store and bake in an oven.  limp and tasteless.  you chicagoans must be easily impressed or have no taste if you think this place is good.  one more interesting fact....this is one of the few places that doesnt have a link on your receipt for a reviewfeedback to the home office about your experience....gee, i wonder why!!
horrible, i had the apple walnut chicken salad.  the chicken was rubbery, full of fat, and tasteless.   i had to actually throw it away.  7.79, no thanks.   i wasnt impressed at all, it was lunch hour, only one person in the dining area, dirty tables  full trash cans.
ive had portillos one other time before this incident.. and i loved their jumbo dogs. but after the distasteful behavior from their employees i will no longer step foot into there. i just got my new chase card and had yet to sign the back of my card. so the lady at the register told me she couldnt use my card unless i had my id. wish of course i accidentally left in my other purse. i get it, its a policy. but when my friend with me went and payed for out meals, the clerk did not even look to see if hers was signed. just swiped it. uhhhhm okay? when i asked her why she didnt look at the back of her card the lady just stared at me. when walking away the three girls started whispering and laughing. so unprofessional. ive been in a customer service job for 5 years and would never treat a customer that way. its not hard to look at a customer and explain a policy. word of advice: skip it, go to teds.
this has 3 stars for the exact reason because its decent food, terrible customer service. first of all, lady at the window was not helpful at all, was very short with us.. actually cut us off before we were even done ordering. my apologies for no other places being open and this is the last stop. wont come here again.
i always see at least one person touching ready to eat food with bare hands. always the fry cook, and this time the drink guy was manipulating ice spillage back into the bin..bare hands..boo
not recommended: portillos is the famous chicago hot dog place and sorry to say but it sucked! awful is putting it nicely. to say we are disappointed is a gross understatement. check your order before you leave the drive thru!!!ive heard so many great things about this place, especially from chicagoans...  i dont get it?  how a hotdog establishment  messes up a hot dog is beyond me.  the hotdog was drenched in ranch and ketchup. it had so much liquid on it our kid refused to hold it until we poured ¾ off. my wife order a grilled tuna sandwich and what she got was a dry chicken sandwich?!??  reminds me of joe pescis character in the lethal weapon movies saying, theyll f€£ you in the drive through!  they did. my hotdog was a sad shriveled up sight. the bun was wet and chewy?  must be a chicago thing, as i tend to enjoy my bread not wet?!?!i want my 20 and wasted time back from this place.  ill avoid this place moving forward.
let me start by saying i have always had great food at portillos but tonight took the cake. it downright sucked and i do not say that often. i picked up my usual when i go there as it is 2 maxwells, 2 italian beef and cheeseburger. and before you say it no it was not all for me. the beef was overcooked, the burger was dry even with condiments and the maxwells where to start. they were burnt beyond recognition thought it was a piece of charcoal on the roll. i could not even eat it as it was so bad. i know that you could have a bad night but the people putting these together could have seen that these were not edible. i was really disappointed as i live about 35 miles away and did not check them until i was home as i did not think i would need too as many times as i have had great service there. i was just about ready to drive back there when i decided to post this. one bad service can almost make someone never return again and i may not unless i receive my money back on this poor excuse of a meal. loaded pic check it out..lol
just say no. this place is awful. they gave me a hard cold croissant and a very chewy hot dog that tasted awful. do yourself a favor and go anywhere but here.
i grew up in tucson, az, and i grew up with lukes italian beef on ft. lowell, literally the best italian beef and hot dogs and grinders ive ever had, without having ever been to chicago. so my dad tells me he had been to portillos in chicago and that lukes copied portillos. says we should totally go, and so im expecting this amazing food. we eat out a lot, and usually when we arent impressed then we just shrug it off, but i was pretty disappointed here. we all were. the big beef was decent sized, but as bland as bland could be. bland and dry. i also got a southwest bbq chicken salad and it looked like something from quiktrip. and you know, i honestly think the salads at qt are better than that. it was supposed to come with bbq ranch, but.... it just tasted like sweet watery mayonnaise in there. oh man.... so disappointed. my daughter got the fried chicken croissant sandwich, which tasted ok, but was nothing to write home about. standard fried chicken item, standard fried chicken taste. i sure hope the original portillos is better than this.
my 2nd time here. first time i came i told myself i would never come again. i was hungry so i decided to try this place out again. i got a italian beef sub with little gravy and hot peppers. i got my italian beef fully dipped with 2 little things of peppers on it. the lady was giving me a hard time and she was also rude. never coming here again
yikes. seriously. im about to be really mean and honest, so if you are scared, stop now.this was truly the worst hot dog we have ever had. they are supposedly good quality, but they were so undercooked and nasty, we could not tell. we had to send the french fries back because they were cold and soggy. the college blank stare brigade standing around at the pickup counter acted like they needed to find a teacher to figure out how to replace the fries. my husband said the relish was scary and he is not picky about hot dogs...he eats them at gas stations and said they are 100 times better than portillos. go to mickys and get a sonoran dog! we did.
very disappointing experience. my family visited the tempe location on wednesday june, 10 2105. we arrived about 7:00 pm. the place wasnt busy and there was no line. after spending 52.00 on a dinner for 5,  the wait to get the food was long. on top of it, the order was wrong. why write what we order on the bag if the people making the food dont read it. it wasnt a complicated order. the food was subpar at best.  seriously, for the money we spent it sucked.   my predictions is you will out price your customer base with the service and quality of food you serve. you have numerous people working, yet nobody managing how the production is completed. from the lack of attention to detail wrong order to the lack of sense of urgency length of time to get the food your company is not worth my time or money. i expect this from mcdonalds or another fast food restaurant but not when i drop some serious coin on food. im taking my business elsewhere portillos.
chicago! ! i never had hotdogs that tasted bland and overpriced,.i believe they buy cheap hotdogs at food city, overprice them, call.it chicago hot dogs and sell it to the fools who will pay the price!nothing special!! buy your dogs at costco and save your money!
worst food and worst costumer service ive had in arizona we decided to try it out instead of in and out. it was outrageously overpriced, food was low quality
actually still sitting in the drive through, which i dont mind.  just placed a pretty large order, and was handed a menu after the order was placed and asked to call ahead next time in a very rude tone.  very simply couldve asked us to pull forward and wait.  horrible customer service.
i really wanted to like this place. it has a drive thru which is a huge plus with kids. but the food was bad. and expensive for what i got. i paid 4 bucks for my small side order of chicken strips. i also tried the bbq chicken salad which was just bad. the chicken was stained an unappealing pink from the bbq sauce. but it didnt even taste like bbq. and the dressing managed to be spicy yet flavorless, a conflicting combo. i was really disappointed. i would have enjoyed mcdonalds more .
ive heard a lot of really good things about this place but every time i come by, its always too packed to try.  my coworker and i noticed the drivethru line only had 2 cars during lunch rush so we jumped at the chance to check it out.  to my amazement they had someone outside taking orders, at noon, in the hottest state in the country during the hottest month of the year with no shade.  after we turned the corner we saw a second person standing next to the menu and speaker box collecting money, again no shade or water in sight.  i was completely appalled by portillos inhumane treatment of their staff.  i wouldnt treat a dog like this and especially not an employee providing a service for me.  i understand that there are jobs which require individuals to work outside under the extreme conditions of an arizona summer but the drivethru line of a fast food restaurant isnt one of them.  so what if your customers have to sit and wait in their air conditioned car a few minutes longer for their fast food, its no excuse to make two human beings stand outside in 110 degree heat when you have a functioning speaker box and two windows to pass money and food.as for the food, my coworker enjoyed his dog but my burger was in styrofoam which is well known to trap moisture so my bun was soggy and my burger fell apart.
food itself is ok, not the greatest, not the worst italian beef ive had. bad thing is they always forget something , when you order cheese fries they forget the cheese. when you order big beef with hot peppers they forget the hot peppers. might seem like a small detail but these are the things that add flavor and taste to otherwise bland food. its like going to a restaurant and they forget to season your food. not impressed at all.
been coming to portillos for awhile but the one in scottsdale. was in tempe and was craving a chocolate cake shake and some good food  what happened to this place? hot dog was tasteless even with every topping possible on it. i always get a chocolate cake shake  lightly mixed at the scottsdale location and in chicago. i asked for that and got the blank stare. had to explain what it was to the worker fml.  got it and of course, was completely blended like normal. went up to the front and asked them to redo it, very nicely. got a rude manager basically looking down on me about it and got a terrible replacement. didnt eat anything and threw it away and walked.never coming back here
red wine and brew fest....lame as hell. disorganized and the venue is far too small. spent the entire time standing in ridiculous lines for everything.
agree with the other posts. terribly disorganized. ive been to beer festivals in tiny towns that had waaaay more to offer than this disaster of an event. i thought about giving it two stars because the bands were good, but the execution was so bad that it really deserves a single.
i set an appointment for today at 5:30pm and was excited and delighted that i got an appointment so quickly. i arrived at 5:15pm at an executive suite at tivoli village where the front door was locked. another woman let me in, she asked me if i was late for my appointment. i told her that my appointment was at 5:30pm and that i was early. she asked if id like water or anything to drink and i said i was good.when i was given a sign in sheet and waiver to sign at 5:40pm by another woman, i casually mentioned that they must be running behind. thats when anna became somewhat defensive and went into this explanation that people are to allow one hour and 10 minutes...including waiting time. i told her that i was told on the phone that it appointment would be about 30 minutes. if she had just said...yes, i am running a little behind, were very popular...but i promise that youll have my undivided attention soon! im pretty sure i wouldnt be writing this.however, it didnt go that way... she asked me if i wanted to cancel the appointment. i said no, that i would wait. she proceeded to tell me that i looked like i was in a hurry and that she takes her appointments seriously. that she charges people 25.00 if clients cancel. that her business is getting so busy that shes going to expand. anna came back to get me at 6:10pm so id waited almost an hour because i was early and walked me back to her office. she took my groupon and wanted to see my drivers license. she wrote my birthday date on the back of the waiver.now i was getting uncomfortable...mostly because how she was treating me. not apologizing for keeping me waiting, or that perhaps things were not explained to me correctly. she did not raise her voice but made it very clear by her body language and tone that she did not want to work with me. i guess i was too much trouble...i explained that i wasnt told much on the phone and when i asked at the time of the appointment about how this all worked, i felt rushed off the phone. she told me that she was the one who set my appointment. i told her that whomever set the appointment told me differently than what she was saying. i was suddenly very discouraged  it felt more like her proving herself to be right than treating me like a paying albeit via groupon client and did not want to be there anymore. so i took my waiver and my groupon, told her that this wasnt working for me and left. she told me that i was not welcomed at her place of business and that she would be reporting me to groupon.i have no idea if it what she does works or not. i just couldnt get past my first impression.
i didnt like this place. i was looking for their office for 30 minutes. its so inconveniently located. the girl who was supposed to perform the services was not very friendly. she was actually a little arrogant in our short conversation. when i went into that small room where everything happens i was shocked. i felt its a scam and i wouldnt see any results. ive had these kind of services performed in much nicer beautiful fancy salons with much better equipment and for the same price. like lv laser services salon. this place is a joke. the room is tiny, the lipo laser machine is not good, i tried it before it doesnt work. i wouldnt go here. i ran from there for my life. but even in a nicer salond these lipo lasers just dont work like they claim. it says you lose noticeable amount of fat in 6 sessions, no i had 10 sessions in a different nicer place and still no result. i stopped believing in all these lipo lasers and cavi lipos and etc.
when i originally purchased this groupon the title was 129 for collagen injections. my fault for not inquiring deeper and doing more research but when i arrived,it was explained to me that  this was a nonevasive procedure. and at that moment i explained to anna that the groupon info l was misleading. but i went ahead since i had already spent 129 dollars.. i didnt see results but im sure every individuals results vary ;  the lasers kept stinging me and anna gave me a custom session due to the stinging in which i felt was a rushed session.  definitely feel i was conned.
i should have known better than to try a business that was not yet reviewed on yelp but alas, i was tempted by the seemingly amazing groupon deal they had going for a lash extension  3 fills for 121. this is one of those times where if something sounds too good to be true, it definitely is!i figured i would this place a shot because of the great deal and the fact that despite not having a yelp page  reviews, they did have their own website and facebook page which looked legit.unfortunately, that was not the case at all. it took over 10 attempts over 3 days  calls  texts  voicemail before i finally heard back to set up the initial appointment for 619. this should have been the first red flag but i really wanted extensions so i figured i would give them the benefit of the doubt since they apologized and noted they usually dont drop the ball but were in the middle of their move to their current location.however, it only got worse when i got to the appointment. despite arriving on time, i waited about 20 minutes so needless to say, the lash technician was rushing through as i was the last appointment on a friday evening.the voucher i got via groupon was actually for a full set of lash extensions and 3 fills. however, at the initial appointment they charged me an extra 25 for the full set as they claimed the groupon was for a natural set which is only 40 lashes. since that seemed pointless to me, everything was rushed, and i couldnt see the full details on my phone while i was there i trusted their word and just paid the 25  for the upgrade so as to avoid controversy. however, when i got home to a computer and double checkedi confirmed the groupon was for a full set and there was absolutely no fine print regarding this upcharge.now 25 is not a big deal for an upgrade and i would be happy to pay it if it were actually for an upgrade. however, nowhere on the fine print of the groupon did they note this upcharge or upgrade option as they should and as i have seen other groupons do. also, the groupon clearly stated full set not natural set. as such, this was a very dishonest business practice in my opinion. now, it has only been a little more than 1 week but so many lashes have fallen out it looks like how it should after 3 weeks at other places. i have gotten extensions at 4 or 5 other businesses and wore them for a total of maybe 6 or 7 months with all the fills and this is by far the worst quality and hack job i have ever seen. i would say about 15 fell out in the first 2 days alone despite my following their instructions to a t and still never wetting my lashes and only washing around them. i have been trying to set up the first fill appointment and after calling  texting  voicemails again for the past 48 hours...no response until today when they are now stating it is a 25 upcharge for an appointment at 5 or 6 in the evening despite their hours being till 7 normally and again, the groupon never stated any of this on the fine print and 5 or 6 pm should not be an upcharge since a fill should not take more than 1 hour.i have been a loyal groupon user for years and never had such an awful experience. save yourself the hasslestresstimemoney and go somewhere that actually cares about the quality of the work they do and getting  keeping new clients cause this place obviously doesnt.
still no one picking up their phone or returning calls despite another 5 attempts...in the past 3 days i must have called over 15 times at different times throughout the day and left 2 voice mails, sent countless texts and with the exception of that 1 text which only noted a 25 surcharge if i wanted to book a 2nd appointment within their usual business hours, as they themselves previously noted, i have not heard anything at all. dont go here. if you bought a groupon and havent used it, call them for a refund immediately!
this place is awful. i called a few times to schedule an appointment and received spotty text responses from multiple numbers which was confusing. finally made an appointment and drove the 45 mins up there they failed to mention they moved to a new location that is very far and no one is available to take me. i got a blank stare and was told it was silly of me to even show up because no one called me to confirm. its been a week and no one has responded to reschedule for the package i already paid for. i reached out to the owner kirin and have not received a response from her either. you guys suck and im sure the beta fish in the dirty water bottle on the counter hates you too.
i found this place on groupon but decided to purchase it in store which was my first mistake. the groupon states 129 for full lash plus 3 fills. when i went to pay i was charge taxes and i ended up tipping price on full amount plus tax so yeah that was my fault. they asked if i wanted volume set which was an extra 25. i said yes and asked if i had to pay extra for full volume each time i get a fill since im getting a groupon. they said no but that was not the case. plus they keep asking you to tip them but i already did when i purchase the groupon!!! lashes lasts less than 2 wks. my 2nd fill 1 eye half actually fell off in less than 2 days and i contacted them and they didnt even care. every time i show up for an scheduled appointment they are at least 40 minutes late. with a half ass sorry we are running late statement but not really sorry. lashes do look good for about 4 days though thats the only good thing. im finishing my last fill as i already purchased but def not coming back and recommend no one to go there.
terrible get your sweets else where! the ice cream was just ok but 7 a scoop? really ? thats pricey even for vegas! the rice crispy treat with marshmallows was tasteless and didnt have any sugary bites. the best parts where the mms lining the marshmallow.
we are gilbert residents and love what is happening with the downtown area. every time a new restaurant opens, we jump at the chance to try it. none have warranted a 1 star review till now.be advised that my review is based entirely on the food. and this was take out.the atmosphere comes out of the same bland design book that all of the other unoriginal fox concept style restaurants on the strip share. all of the houses in gilbert do too so who cares about that.the service was fine, a pleasant young lady answered the phone and took my order at 5:56 pm. she told me 1520 minutes so i arrived at 6:09. it was done. glad i showed up early to the flavor party! again, pleasant hostess, etc.boxes seemed hot when i picked them up and how could they not be right? they are cooked in a million degree sparkly hipster pizza oven nest pa? i immediately jay walked directly across the street to my truck and sped home, anxious to try whatever authentic italian offering was so definitely waiting in my tiny little pizza boxes. we live less than 2 miles door to door from pomo and i hit all the green lights. 5.25 minute drive maybe?  i arrive at my home, whip the boxes out on the counter and fling the tops open. at first glance, the pizzas look like someone dumped campbells creamy tomato soup on a pizza crust. bah! i think to myself, dont let your eyes deceive you! this place is one of the only places on the gilbert strip to get 5 star reviews out of the box.kids!!! pizzas here!!!!do i wait? what do you think?i grab a paper plate and wrestle out a slice of each; the bufala verace and the porcini pizza. well, in this case, my first impression was correct. the pizza was cold. cold. the flavor was bland. bland. the porcini mushrooms had mouth feel similar to cover your ears ...i cant even say it... think garden slug meets oyster. my favorite tomato in the universe, the san marzano plumb tomato was supposed to be the star of this pizza... i think it got hijacked by the afore mentioned tomato soup. the crust was soggy in the middle, reasonably crispy on the edge and salty. like really really salty, and kind of strangely bitter too.enough of the sub par pizza... i would have rather thrown in a 2.37 costco cheese pizza.lets talk price. im guessing that these are 12 pizzas. i measured the box and it seems reasonable that they are. i bought a total of 24 of pizza for a whopping 37.62 thats 1.58 per inch. i dont know why i did that math there or how that relates to anything but i can tell you this: i dont want to spend 1.58inch on any food item unless it really, really knocks my socks off or is to die for!whats that zinburger? i know, i know... i will never cheat on you again... :
wife and i went in last weekend. we have been patiently waiting for them to open and were excited to finally go. i will cut to the chase. we were very disappointed. we started with drinks and an appetizer. the app was their version of calamari and shrimp. it was pricey and very bland. i had to cover it in salt just to make it palatable. drinks were over priced and unimpressive. after the uneventful premeal, we decided to play it safe and order their signature pizza, the pomo. cant go wrong there, right?.... well, it was absolutely bland and tasteless. terrible pizza. not sure what all the hype is about this place. i live in gilbert and frequent the heritage district quite often. believe me, there are far better choices all within walking distance to this place. needless to say, i will not be going back to pomo any time soon.
nice atmosphere.  inside dinning area needs more air conditioning.  but more importantly, the pizza was very mediocre.  soggy in the middle, did not hold the toppings.  very disappointed.
i am always excited to try new restaurants. i wasnt very excited to try this place and now i know why. i dont understand how so many people gave this place 4 or 5 stars. so the menu selection was very disappointing. ordered the mista salad and that was plain nothing special. ordered margherita cheese pizza which was very plain as well just nothing special but the 90 second cook time was pretty fabulous. capellini pasta was nothing special as well just pasta with tomato sauce it seems. everything was overpriced for what you got. overall not impressed and not worth a second visit in my opinion.
food was good, service was poor!!! my wife and i came to downtown to check out some of the newer restaurants. weve been to liberty, zinburger, and a few others already. we both thought, hey, lets try this place, looks nice. we walk in, and get seated right away, outside, because the weather is perfect. this place isnt busy. there are open tables inside, and outside wasnt even close to half full. normally we would expect someone to come over, bring some water, and greet us. nope. 10 minutes later...nope. 15 minutes in, my wife gives me the look. we have seen a few employees walk right past us while waiting 15 minutes for someone to just see if we needed help. finally, someone did. we asked for water, plus i got a peach iced tea, while my wife ordered a glass of wine. another 10 minutes roll by before our waiter come back, asks if we have any questions, then walks off. wow. finally comes back and asks if we are ready to order, which we did. two pizzas. the pizzas come out within 10 minutes. food was great, pizza was moist, and very flavorful. while eating the waiting visited us once. 20 minutes or so, he notices we are finished, and asks if we would like a box. we did, he said he would be back with the check. 10 minutes, nothing. 15 minutes, wow, he made it back. he started to walk towards us, then stopped, turned around and printed up our check. we paid up, still tipped, and left. i just have to say, even with the pizza being as good as it was, we will never go back here. too many other choices around.ok, so management reached out to me, gonna give them another try. ill amend the review if it changes.
great service, however food is not good. we started off with the caprese. this was literally 3 slices of tomato and 3 slices of cheese on a plate with 3 leaves of basilas garnish. no seasoning! it was so bland and was somethings i could have made at home in less than a minute. 9.00next we had the pollo salad. this was spring mix, tomatoes and olives only. tossed in a lemon oil dressing. again was so bland and had no taste! the chicken was warm as was seasoned food though 14.00then our pizza and pasta came. we had the quattro pizza. the sausage was good but there wasnt very many pieces but the crust as good cause it was thin. pasta was horrible, i compared it to canned ravioli and my husband described it as hamburger helper! pizza 16.00 and pasta was 15.00this place is over priced and just tasteless. the menu only consist of appetizers, 4 salads, 2 soups, 4 pastas and pizzas to choose from! again service was great but that is all this place has going for it!
sucked.  cardboard pizza, soggy sourdough bread and slow service.  as we walked down the street, every restaurant was packed except this one  no wonder.  oreganos is 20 yards away with better menu options, better food and service.
worst service i have ever received. it took them over an hour to bring the food out. our waiter wouldnt look at us. we had to ask another waiter to lol got ours so they could take our drinks. the food was bland and overpriced. the pizza had no flavor. i was extremely disappointed. for 8 people, we paid over 220 dollars. and we did not order any specialty anything.
manager and staff are very rude. do not appreciate the service here.
so, they are fast just like they claim. however their food is not that spectacular. i ordered a sandwich on whole wheat bread. one of the pieces of bread was the heel of the loaf not to mention that the bread was stale.this is not the first time ive received stale bread from this location. i ordered extra sprouts on the sandwich as well, and there were barely any on the sand. i guess thats an improvement over last time when i ordered  sprouts and got none.fast is not always better.
i have ordered many times from multiple jimmy johns around town and my coworkers also do. the last three times i have ordered from this location, they have botched the order. today was the last time i will order from them. i placed my order for delivery. i ordered a country club with no tomatoes, a bag a chips and a coke. the delivery guy handed me a bag with two sandwiches  again, i only ordered one . one of the sandwiches was correct to my order, the other was not. i explained to the driver what happened and he asked me to call the store. as i explained to robin  who was very cordial and identified herself as the manager she asked me to return the receipts and they would refund my money and it would take 23 days. i asked how am i to know that it will be refunded and how i would prove the purchase without a receipt. reluctantly i sent the receipt back with the driver and eventually received a call back from robin. she said that due to the way their system is set up, they had to refund the entire amount but would need to place another charge of the amount that should have been charged. so now, they want to charge me again before my money is secured back to my account  putting me out a total of over 30 until 23 days from now because of a mistake they made. i informed her that i would never again order from that location and would pass this information on to my coworkers. very poor customer service.
garbage. pre cooked meat in a non working steam table. confusing choices. grocery store tortillas. my tacos were ice cold. so if you are in the mood for some tasteless cold tacos this is the place for you. and to top it off their fancy coca cola dispensing robot only dispenses water and tea. so if you would like to wash down your cold tacos with a nice refreshing draft soda..... forget it.
terrible terrible service. ive had a dozen cleaners over the last 5 years and never  had an issue with any of them. this business is run by someone who know how to write an app but not provide a cleaning service. i feel like the victim of fraud. i was moving out of an apt  didnt have time to clean. they spent 5 hours cleaning a 2 x 5 kitchen that wasnt messy to begin with.
1st visit  this location, ordered a 12 piece inside the store to go. i got home, i was only given 8 pieces called to speak to a manager, phone busied out. took a drive back explained to the manager what happened, he had an attitude about it, told one of the food handlers to go ahead and get 4 more pieces and added i dont know whatever to one of them. didnt appreciate that i was being treated like i did something wrong by asking for the 4 pcs that were not given to me, not 1 apology from management or staff behind the counter. not very good customer service, definitely going to take this one up chain.
very very disappointed!!! will not be back!!ordered a 4 piece mild strip meal for my 2 kids got to pick up window was handed a box in no to go bag. i opened box and no strips it was 4 pieces of chicken. they guy at window said we dont sell 4 piece strip meal i said why didnt they tell me when i ordered he said i didnt take ur order. i said fine i asked for the 3rd time is it mild he said yes. needless to say my kids diner was ruined and i just dumped 10.00 in the trash it was spicy not mild. my 5  6 year old has a burning mouth and 2 bites each of mac n cheese for diner thank you very much popeyes for ruining my kids diner
disappointed  even though i repeated my order 3 times, it was delivered incorrectly. sides too small for the price. chicken was over cooked and dry. over ran by large staff: confusion and disorganization.
keeping everything in perspective, you should know my wife and i love, love, love cajuncreole food and have experienced the ultimate of louisiana cuisine at places like chef paul prudhommes k pauls louisiana kitchen in new orleans, to far more modest establishments around the country... all of which still provided very enjoyable, tasty and authentic cajun style food.when we visited this popeyes on july 9th, being fast food after all, we did not expect them to rival any of those other establishments, but hoped theyd at least provide a quick cajun fix. unfortunately they failed miserably on a few very key points  i will start with the positive. the staff was very friendly and took our order for blackened chicken tenders, red beans  rice and cajun fries promptly and accurately at 3:11pmunfortunately it all went downhill from there. we received our order at 3:13pm, grabbed some napkins and by the time we got to our table less than a minute after receiving our order the food was cool beans and fries to barely lukewarm chicken. we immediately went back to the counter now approx 3:15pm to tell them our food was cold. again the staff was great and said theyd take care of it immediately. while we were waiting for our meal replacement i noticed a manager, advised him what happened and that he might want to check food temps to see if they met health code standards. he immediately went behind the counter and checked the temperature of the blackened chicken and red bean  rice containers by touch not a thermometer and instructed the staff to pull the cajun chicken from under the warmers. no doubt this was why at 3:26pm i was still waiting for our replacement order. a few minutes later our replacement food finally came and while warm enough to eat, it was not what we would consider to be freshly prepared hot. in addition the blackened chicken was not spicy or crusty as is the case at any real cajuncreole restaurant. it frankly tasted like reheated precooked chicken dusted in bargain brand store bought cajun spice mix.in addition, the cajun fries were a complete joke. for 1.99 we got a total of 16 fries in varying sizes... which works out to 12.4 cents apiece. seriously... 16 fries for 1.99. the flavor was also so unappealing that even sharing the 16 fries between us there were still 3 left when we discarded our trash. havent these guys ever checked out their competition? someone at popeyes corporate needs to walk a block to the in n out to see what the words value, hot, flavorful and consistent quality really mean.no doubt there are loyal popeyes fans everywhere that will discount our opinion and they are entitled to theirs. this popeyes is new and is perhaps not representative of the chain in general, but our experience was so unappealing well never give any popeyes location our business. there are too many better tasting and higher quality choices available.its nice to see companies opening new locations because it creates jobs and we hope for that reason alone they get their act together and are able to stay in business.
a five piece strips dinner should contain five strips, not four. sadly, today was not the first time this has happened to me. plus the four strips i did receive were cold and tasted like they had been sitting there for a while. yuck. get it together, popeyes!
big popeyes fan. i frequent the one on broadway between mill and priest near my work. delicious food excellent service. this popeyes near my house terrible. made me never want to eat popeyes again. chicken was like rubber. made both my girlfriend and myself sick. employees have no idea whats going on. to top it all off they give you 1 tiny little sauce per meal and want 30 cents for any extra. the one on broadway never charges for extra sauce. guess i will only go to that one from now on. i do not recommend going to this one if its your first time trying popeyes you probably wont ever want to go back. very dissappointed.
with this newly opened popeyes location the management needs a lesson in customer service. after my first visit saturday night the place was busy but is no excuse for incomplete orders. after i got home i realized my order was incomplete and i quickly called to let them know, i was given a code for me to get what was missing on my next visit.  fast forward today when i returned but forgot to bring the code with me. the person who stated he was above the manager told me he could not and would not replace my item without the code. now were not talking about national security and the code is critical!! this manager person was argumentative and condescending and kept telling me, its their policy and i said why isnt it their policy to guarantee orders are correct!!! so im out money for an order i shouldve received in the first place.  ill see what kind of customer service ill get from the higher ups who are higher than this person who is higher than the store manager as this mofo kept reiterating....
what a disappointment. 6.00 for a 2 piece combo that was a dry as the desert. take a bite take a drink, take a bite take a drink...so sad. was so looking forward to a good piece of chicken. the bisket and dirty rice was the only saving gracethe service was fast and ask they handed me my to go box getting in the car thinking check the box. .if you get to go please put some utensils in the box.that was the first strike i hope i dont have a strike 2
first off i should mention its way overpriced. seriously its like 7 for like a two piece. second i got a po boy if you want to call it that it was bread slapped with many ions  and some lettuce that tasted really gross and they slapped on 3 pickles and 2 chicken tenders they werent even warm or even so what hot ordered a kids meal for my daughter came with 1 chicken tender what three year old is going to eat just one chicken tender. the chicken not very even good at all i choose canes 100 more than popeyes. im sorry popeyes but it just wasnt up to my expectations. i wont be going back
i wish i could give this place zero stars.  the chicken was mediocre, the dark meat tasted like white meat.  i order dark meat for a reason, so it doesnt taste like dry white meat.  this already being disappointing, i open my mashed potatoes with gravy... what is this?  theres almost no gravy!  we ask for more, saying theres hardly any.  a female manager, short with dark hair, responds without seeming to care at all and in a really rude and dismissing tone that an small cup of extra gravy is 1.99 and they only put a small scoop into their mashed potatoes... im sorry, 2 for gravy when my potatoes were supposed to already have it?  that small scoop wasnt much of anything, it looked like they spit some gravy into my potatoes.  i tried to make up for the lack of gravy by using a biscuit to eat it with, but that was worse than on its own.  the biscuit was dry and flavorless.  i will never come back to this disgusting place again, especially with disrespectful, disinterested employees.
we were so excited to have a popeyes chicken open up in se gilbert. at first, when they first opened up, the chicken was hot and fresh.  but the last few times we have been back the quality has been going down fast. very disappointed once again. this will be our last time going to popeyes. the chicken has been dry.  i swear the chicken has been sitting on the rack all day. the pieces are getting smaller and full of breading and hardly any meat. very disappointing.
i love southern style chicken...   but this place has no southern hospitality.. !!!   the service is really bad..  no good afternoon,  no thank you,  no have a good day,     drive thru they give you the box and sauces stacked on each other with no bag !!  you have to ask for a bag..    no smile..   just terrible..   all employee are the same..  that reflects 100 on management..  if management was good, if management had trained employees to treat customers in a good manner, and if management had trained employees to care, then they would have... but i guess management is not good..   this is many times i go there,  same bad experience..  not to mention, every time something is missing from the order...
well we should of payed more attention to the awful reviews prior to this !! yes, we had a terrible experience.  when we entered the restaurant there was no one except for us there, there must of been without kidding 20 plus employees having their own party among themselves, a massive amount of chicken already prepared, ready for the dinner rush and getting cold as it lay.  we both ordered my husband wanting to try their new peppered chicken what a joke his was less hot then my mild chicken tenders... he had to add louisana hot sauce to make it alittle spicey.the restaurant was freezing, we both wore our jackets the whole time we were there, it was by far warmer outdoors... we mentioned it to a couple people in the back the only answer we got was that was why they were dressed for a blizzard !! no concern whatsoever.my husband mentioned about the chicken with no different taste then the regular tenders mild at that oh well, thats how they come???????what....???my tenders were luke warm at best when i recieved them.  i just ate them, we were already.......upset that we chose this place instead of just any other !!! at this point so upset.so take my advice............look at all these 1 star reviews before you enter........choose another any other i might add...eating choice.
omg, stay away. 30 minutes at our table and we were never served. not even a glass of water. we walk out and call to complain about the bad service and to request a parking refund, as we paid to park for no reason now, but all odie the manager did was defended our waitress and refused to do anything for us. all i wanted was parking reimbursement. then when i asked for her bosses name and times of availability, she got very snoty and told me to call tomorrow as managers dont have set schedules. i cant imagine you will last another 3 months. im sharing on fb, ig, snapchat, already tweeted it. im ok with mistakes, im not ok with rude managerial staff. odie  and corvette need a lot more training.
im not one to typically post a bad review but i felt like i should spare others the bad experience.  had been here for lunch prior in the week so thought i would go back for dinner before a show.  although getting the bill at lunch took way too long figured that wasnt a big deal.  for dinner however it was a calamity of service errors.  30 minutes to get drinks, 45 for food.  wrong food items delivered to the table to the point we just quit telling them.  45 minutes for our wives drinks then food came intermittently in waves.  overall some of the worst service ever.  also my burger was ordered medium and brought out well done.  to the management...... you have a great location and decent food,  get your service together before your out of business.  also two couples walked out while we were there that were sat when we were and we overheard even people sitting at the bar complaining about service.  manager did apologize and comp most of our bill, we that is after we actually were billed the correct amounts, as all the happy hour items we ordered were billed in error.
unprofessional, uncompassionate, deceitful.  the day a doctor was to make a house call, i had called them to find out what time the appointment was scheduled yes, they gave me an appointment for my brother, but no time and they told me they were having major technical difficulty and couldnt promise a visit from the doctor.  where is their lawful disaster recovery  plan?  three people working the phones, all other employees gone.  was a schedule printed up the day before?  ugh, unbelievable. im also a health care provider, if i treated my patients like this, i wouldnt have a job.  shameful.....
based on all the one star responses...i have to agree.  after a knee surgery in 2014, i was referred to md24.  initially, all was good.  but as of late, i have to retract good and revise to plain awful.  first, the schedulers cannot remember i am a dialysis patient.  i am not available mon, wed and fri.  they call late afternoon on the day before and schedule me with no regard to my treatments. then they offer a broad window kind of like a cable tv repairman.  and, when they do show, it is usually a new doc i have never seen before and have to spend the first hour going over med history.  then if you need meds refills, dont call your local pharmacy, cause md24 never replies to any refill requests..  and most recently, i had a dialysis emergency and had to cancel an appointment.  i was told theyd call to reschedule. i waited a week and nothing.  so, i called.  i was told a rep should call within the week.  and no call.  i tried again, same mumbojumbo and still no call.  and, prescriptions are needed i.e. anxiety meds.   and, with all the plethora of physicians, none really do a thorough check up.  maybe a blood pressure check with a discount cuff.  no real exams.  there was one doc who really stuck out and went above and beyond, but  i understand dr moss is no longer with their employ.  i am looking for a new doc, but most are booked through the spring. but i am very tempted to drive out of county for my health needs if needed.
to date after several calls, still no showing.  i was told there are no doctors in my area on my free days.  they have tried twice to schedule on my dialysis days. but, those are days i cannot reschedule.  i was impressed by a yelp reply.  but is just an empty promise.  it has been three months and prescriptions are almost gone and some are required written and cannot be called in.  whats more amazing is the main office is a couple miles from my home. the service was adequate for the time i was not mobile but i guess i have to shop for a new physician.
this store always has a ton of employees on staff yet they seem to only be good at standing around and talking to each other. so beyond incompetent and everyone seems to just be walking around like chickens with their heads cut off.
really weird service. we had three for dinner.two dishes were bad and we did not eat them. at the end of the meal they were left over. as expected they wanted us to pay for them. i said sure charge me if you want but the dishes were not good. start: 10 minutes of guilt and shaming and accusations like:    if you let it sit it wont be any good    aggressively: if you want it crispy i will go in the kitchen and watch over them to make sure it is crispy    you didnt need to cover the dish, it makes me feel bad   oh it went on. they also spilled fish soup in two drinks and two dishes when they put it in the table i dont like seafood and were pretty rude about that too. several dishes inedible by me friends ate em because they were too oily. we had to call them over to accept the ipad orders and to refill drinks. my friend said the last two times he was there service was better. pretty bad experience!
horrible.  i have come before when they first opened and it was nice which was why i came back.  my family and i came in at 4:30 pm today a monday and not busy at all.  it took 5 minutes for us to be seated.  there was only 2 other tables dining in yet no server would seat us.  even the cooks saw us but no one was there to seat us or at least get someone to, which is ridiculous.  by the time the women came to us and seated us, she left.  we thought, i guess well just start ordering, so we did.  she then came back, no expression or tone at all, just blank, grabbed the tablet, got frustrated at the tablet, cleared it what we had ordered, and proceeded with our drink orders.  the food was okay overall, i wish they didnt give out everything at one time.  the food runner was nice enough to say what everything was when she handed it out but the server just dropped it off like she was handing out papers. no care at all, no smile, no look, like a robot.  service was horrible, but there wasnt even service to begin with.  when food came out, we ran out of space on the table and they just stacked them on top of other food full of plates.  the food is average and went quickly down in quality since they opened.  with my family of 2 adults, 2 teens, and 1 child, the food came to 115.72 with 2 teas and a pop with the 5 discount for paying by cash but you have to pay at least a 10 tip before you leave if you have a party of 5 people.  for the cost of food and the service provided, it was not worth it.  i will not be coming back and i do not recommend.  overall, mediocre food, poor service, nice decor, will not be returning.also, the ice cream freezer reeked of old expired milk.  yuck.
this place is a disaster!!!me being a native of texas i was finally glad to see this place open up.  the first time i went there with my wife and son at 630pm for dinner and they were out of 80 percent of there menu.  no ribs, brisket and 1 scoop of cheesy potatoes left.  a few weeks later we tried it again at 630pm and we were greeted by a sign that read all out of meat.  what kind of place is this.  then they had an employee who tried to explain why they were out of meat.  what kinda of restaurant consistently runs out of food at 630pm.  ive been to plenty of restaurants that were new and they were never out of food...especially at 630pm.  they might as well only be open for lunch.  this place would be the laughing stock of bbq if it was in texas.  i will never attempt to eat at this place again.
we went to got que today and will not be returning.. first we told ricky the server that we had need been there before and we asked for a sample.. he looked at me like i had 3 eyes. so said id like to try the brisket and pork and see which i like better. he rudely stated the brisket tastes like brisket the pork tastes like pork. i found this extremely rude. if they dont do samples thats all he had to say. anyways we got the family package of pork.. it wasnt anything that you couldnt do in a crockpot..  the coleslaw we got was horrible.. something was defiantly missing... and the meal was served with sara lee hamburger buns.. aweful customer service and food was nothing spectacular.. if your looking for great bbq make the drive to rudys
worst bbq ive ever had. the family and i were really looking forward to this place opening. the bbq pulled pork was good but everything else was awful. the ribs looked like they were boiled and were gray  you had to squeeze bbq sauce on them after you paid for them. the buns were cold and the coleslaw had absolutely no flavor. cheesy potatoes were nothing to write home about. my husband cooked the ribs for another 2 hours once he got home  at which point they were good. the sign implies the food is smoked but i highly doubt any smoker was used for the menu items. i really was hoping for the best and to get some more mom and pop restaurants in surprise, but i dont think this one fits the bill.
you people in arizona have no clue what bbq is supposed to taste like.... this place is terrible the ribs are plain with no taste..the sauce is watered down also with no taste and the ribs dont fall off the bone!!!!
the price is way out of line for the size of the portions of bbq. the food was average couldnt  really tell with what little portion we were served. the sides were very blan.
terrible service inattentive staffslow food service broken machine staff refused to give owners phone number to tell him how they are killing his business
had chilli dog and got food poisoning. sick for 3 days
ive been twice now. .once at lunch and once at happy hour. ..service is terrible. at 1130 we waited for 10 min before being acknowledged and brought to a take. hh we waited for drinks we waited for food.
ive been here twice and both times i was very disappointed. i ordered the cobb salad vegetarian and i emphasized that i couldnt eat meat. when my salad arrived at the table there was meat on it and she didnt even notice! i had to tell her and she didnt even seem sympathetic. the waitress brought me a new salad and the lettuce seemed wet and there was water in my salad dish. to start, the chips were cold and didnt taste fresh. the wait to get the food took extremely long and the waitress seemed like she hated her job. after giving it a second try i will definitely not be going back.
our family loves carlos obriens and has been many times over the years for occasions at the old location. first time visiting the new location and the service was  absolutely terrible. as a party of 10 we were seated and waited 10 minutes with zero acknowledgement. the busser came by to clean the table from the previous guests and we had to ask him to grab a server. not that the server helped much. terrible attitude and she seemed put out to be helping us. the server was rude all night and came over maybe a handful of times, we were celebrating after each visit from her. drinks waters and chips sat empty for most the visit. countless staff members walked by our table with no efforts to serve.hopefully this is a one time thing, and we will be back again, but extremely disappointed in the service.
i was a huge fan of carlos obriens. i have been dining here for years.  it definitely has gone down hill over the years. we had a reservation yet they were seating walk ins first.  we got to our table and there was trash everywhere, chips on the floor, salsa on the table which the hostess wiped with her hand, trash all around the busing station. if you have ever been to a restaurant that has saw dust on the floor i would say the same here except chips on the floor. the waiter was pleasant and did the best he can.  we ordered appetizer and when he gave me the plates i started to serve the appetizer to my family i picked up a plate and in between the plates was salsa they were dirty!!! i ordered the fajitas and asked for all rice no beans yet we got all beans no rice? my son ordered the chicken burrito and it had bones in it which is very dangerous, luckily he didnt choke on the bones.  when i told the waiter he didnt seem concerned.  still the best salsa in town but too dirty for us.
the new location was very pretty, but thats where it ended. hostess wasnt very friendly. table was wet when  we were seated. food was mediocre at best. my husband ordered a plain burrito, meat only. it came out with cheese. the waiter couldnt understand why that would be a problem. turns out my husband doesnt like cheese, but there are lots of people that cant eat cheese. it shouldnt have been an issue and he shouldnt have had to explain why he didnt care to eat it. my enchiladas came out in an unappealing watery sauce. service was incredibly slow and getting beverage refills was a hassle as we had to chase down the staff. wont be going back!
my family and i dined here recently, and we were disappointed to say the least. i ordered the carne asada medium rare, and it came out extremely well done. plus, it tasted awful. the rest of my family was equally unhappy with their dishes. the only dish that was passable was the carnitas platter. do yourself a favor and go somewhere else; there are plenty of great mexican joints in the valley.
the other location was better i had never had a problem but last time i was there all of our food was cold and tasted awful manager didnt accept responsibility said they cant guarantee our food be warm when we get home and that maybe it was my fault food took over an hour until it was ready our bill was 70 dollars with tip i understand mistakes but the both managers i contacted one of which whos name is corey were not helpful and seemed not to care i will not go back ajo als is closer so i will be going there from now on
so disappointed!  they closed one that did such a good job, and opened this piece of crap.  let us start with the interior, you walk into a greet station complete with seating to wait.  wait, no this is not where you go to get sat, you open another set of doors and are now in the bar, wait what?  here you find the greeting station, and now we wait looking like deer in headlights wondering who is going to seat us.   ahh finally someone seats us right at a waitress we absolutely do not like.  should i say, hmmm sure why not, heidi, if you get her run away.  they must have been in a hurry to get the place open because everything about the decor screams last business in the building including the horrendous panel dividers separating the dining from the bar.  we are sat in one of the booths that is open at both ends.  the booths that are against the wall are raised to where if someone is sitting in them you are looking right at theyre crotch. so we place our drink order and a cheese crisp, and i notice the bus boychips and salsa getter is too busy placing settings at empty tables then to bring chips and salsa to us, by the way there is only 4 tables sat so they so needed the settings done.  we get the chips and salsa and are told the cheese crisp will be out soon, menus sitting on edge of table so obviously we are ready to order, and heidi walks away.  here comes the cheese crisp, and there goes heidi again. ok now she comes back to see if we are ready to order omg. we order and she does her best at saving us money by saying shes going to give us items off of the lunch menu instead of regular menu we looked at.   now for the food her sour cream enchilada chicken,  she picked most of the chicken out of it saying it tasted cooked, frozen and thawed, or it was from a can.  mine was shredded beef tacos, shredded beef had no flavor and tasted pretty dang awful.   lets not forget about the rice,  where do i start.  it tasted old, was very sticky and in wet clump piles.  it is time to pay and get the  out, wheres heidi, shes staring out the front window.the bill is here yay!!!!!!  noooooooo......  2 dr. peppers, 2 dinners, 1 cheese crisp 52 what!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  took 5 minutes to get her attention even though she is helping the table right in front of us repeatedly.  guess what she put that tables order on our bill too......  maybe we wouldnt notice and pay it?????  8 minutes later we get a corrected bill, 30 for half eaten food.  while all this waiting is going on we are paying attention to the wait station.  it consists of i believe a 5 shelve wire rack.  at the top is to go boxes and cheese crisp boxes.  the next shelf down has odds and ends and 2 pitchers on plates, one is water and other is tea.  the next shelf down has the utensils in it, yep underneath the wire shelf with the pitchers on it.  the next shelf is where they are putting all the dirty dishes.  we cant see the bottom shelf.  and the best part is the garbage can is right next to the shelves with nothing preventing the food from flying up as it is thrown into it.  this was chance number 3 at the new location.  there will not be a 4!!!!we are done with you carlos omethinks not!!
we have had myriad issues with these guys, and one good experience.  they have worked hard to earn a never again recommendation.1.  estimated 2 hours to fix flat tire.  would not set appointment for return time.  only option was to wait the 2 hours.  they explained to us that they are a full service shop and cannot just cut us in line, and that they dont make appointments for flat fixing.  the only option was to get in line.  other shops have much better service than this.  i complained to corporate and they said they would discuss it with the management.2.  would not honor treadwear warranty, even partially, when 80k tires wore out in 30k miles.  they said that since the tires were not completely evenly worn they were only worn slightly more at the edges, that the tire manufacturer would not cover them  they wore out early because of vehicle condition.  so i bought some tires elsewhere and then decided to go back and hassle them, for only that reason, knowing full well it would lead nowhere.  i was wrong.  they were changing management and a corporate guy was there who charged his corporate account to refund a prorated amount on the tires.  i had them mount my new tires, bought a lifetime alignment, and told them if they continue to treat me this way i will be happy to continue coming back.3.  each store must be responsible for making a buck.  as soon as the corporate guy was gone they were back to the same tricks, even with the new management.  i did some work on the car which required an alignment check when finished.  i asked my wife to call and make an appointment to take it in.  the guy wouldnt make an appointment, so he was asked what time would be best to bring it in.  he said right then was a good time.  it took two and a half hours to check the alignment.  and he told my wife that the warranty on the alignment is only good if we have them do all the work on the vehicle.  i paid for a lifetime alignment on the vehicle and they wanted to revoke it because someone else worked on it.  when i got home i asked where the alignment results print out was.  my wife said she did not get one, the guy said something about the printer being broken.  at that point she was so tired of dealing with the kids that she just wanted to get out of there.  unfortunately, the vehicle started pulling to one side, so we needed to take it back.  my wife refuses to go back there because they wont make an appointment, and they wont complete the work in a timely fashion.  two weeks after the alignment check i had to go down with her and drop the vehicle off for an entire day.  when we got it back there was still no print out of results printer still broken.  and the vehicle still pulls to the side.  and we are done with this outfit.
dont do it. just dont. tiny crabs, looked like sand crabs, or maybe and std left unchecked way to long. my fingers hurt from trying to eat them. my tummy is rumbling... well just have to see how tomorrow goes, but i may be ill. dry, dry cake. its all just like pieces of a bad dream. just use your better judgment and never eat here. no matter how drunk you are. if you cant resist a good time of awful overpriced food, head over to the seigal suites and give yourself a little punishment.if you really hate yourself, order the crab. hey, it was an experience, thats for sure.even though i would not classify the service as good, the waitress was a very nice person. is that what you say right before you break up with someone?enjoy!
horrible would never recommend.   sat for 40 minutes after ordering and finally complained them left
very disappointed. we got here about 10 minutes before they opened. we waited outside on the deck  and a server still approached us and initiated conversation so my immediate hopes were high. we sat down when they were officially open, and it took about 10 minutes to be greeted. 10 minutes! there was nobody in here! had to wait another 10 to get water. im not sure if the staff was having an off day, or had no sense of customer service. we ordered the pretzel appetizer. it came out in good time. unfortunately there were 4 of us and our server didnt bring us plates, so we had to stare at the pretzel until she came over. the pretzel was delicious so thats the only reason this place gets one star. 3 of us received our entrees, the 4th had to wait another 10 minutes. if you want good service i suggest not coming here.
i am glad other people had a good experience here but we did not. it started out well because we were greeted by a host right away and directed to great seats with a great view. another server brought menus and said your server will be over in a a few minutes no problem, we could wait. after a few minutes  another host came over and said  you should probably just go to the bar and get your drinks, its going to be a long wait.... seriously? we picked our stuff up and moved on because there only a million other places we could go and not be asked to serve ourselves.  good luck with this place, i hope you get served.
first of all the general manager looks worse than the bums on the streetsecond he was extremely rude to my family and i.  also the food  was overpriced and did not give the full portion size....you live and learn and never step foot in the space again... by the way the service was extremely slow like molasses its a 30 minute wait for water...
absolutely terrible experience. food took over 30 minutes to get to our table, watched other tables who sat down after us get their food first. there was only one girl who was bringing orders out and she was running around like crazy. i noticed she was even bringing bowls out for the same table several minutes apart. she noticed we looked annoyed and asked us what we ordered shouldnt that be on their computer screen? shouldnt she be able to look from the number that is sitting on our table?? we told her and a few minutes later she came back with our food. my bowl was the wrong size, we were missing a soup and bread. she came back, brought the bread, asked if it was ok just to bring another small pasta instead of a regular size, and said the soup was being cooked. ten minutes later she returns with the soup. none of the vegetables in the soup are cooked. there are raw mushrooms, onions, and tomatoes sitting in a soup. my spoon falls out of the bowl as an employee is walking by. he picks it up and says guess you dont want this and walks off. i assumed he would be brining another but he never did! the additional noodles she brought out to supplement my undersized bowl are missing spinach. i go to refill my water. none comes out of the drink machine. when we are about done with our food too frustrated to bother with the soup the manager comes to our table and asks us if everything is ok. i said no and proceed to attempt to tell her everything that went wrong. she cuts me off and says she is going to issue a refund. im glad she offered a refund but her attitude was horrible. she did not seem genuinely sorry and i would imagine a good manager would want to hear all issues so they can be addressed with employees. when she comes back with the refund receipt, she has refunded everything except a fountain drink. hilarious! it was just another cut in the already terrible experience. i will never return to this location.i am a frequent customer at the noodles and company on south boulevard. the south blvd location is wonderful, they are extremely friendly, they get food out within about 5 minutes, and the food tastes great. they have made a mistake before but it has been very minor and they seemed genuinely sorry and offered me a dessert!
so i was really upset because we just found out that this bar existed. first of all when you google dog bars this place does not come up and it was super hard to figure out of this place existed or not. then we went to the jackalope website and found a link for this place and we were super excited because we have been looking for a good dog bar to go to. on the website it said saturday had live band and specials so we headed there. when we get there it was closed!!! it was 5 o clock on a saturday!!! no signs explaining why or no reason for it. we checked there website and facebook page and no explanation that it would be closed so we drove all the way there for no reason!!! we called jackalope jacks and asked if they k we why they were closed, they said it shouldnt be closed they are open! we said no we are standing in front of it and its closed!! she seemed really confused! it seems like someone just didnt want to come to work that day! it was extremely disappointing!! maybe ill change my review when i go back and hopefully it will actually be open that time!!
new apartment complex that over promises and under delivers. put a deposit down on a building still under construction... leasing agent showed us a blue print with no compass and read it to us backwards!!!!!!!! now all the apartments are already leased and we have the option of moving again or paying an extra 400 a month for an apartment facing in the right direction. this complex does nothing to accommodate for their mistakes. dont let their facade of luxury deceive you into having to deal with their inefficient management team.
the most dishonest apt complex i have ever had to work with. one minute the manager tells us we will have to wait for corporate to fix their mistake. never hear back.. so we go to the office and are told corporate changed their minds and wont be handling it. it has been 1 month and im still looking at boxes and not able to use the kitchen or build furniture. im paying rent for a place i cant use. the manager is disrespectful, degrading, and vindictive. i hope you dont have a  9 to 5 monday through friday job because the manager doesnt respond to emergencies or concerns outside of these hours. apartments have been broken into and flooded and staff doesnt call or show up for 3 hours. why bother having an emergency hotline? the pool area and fire pit closes at 8pm every night. isnt this vegas? the cave is a neat concept but tvs get turned off when the office closes. im glad they took the time to write a reply when they should be responding to my phone calls and emails. oh, and they never called like they stated in the reply either. imagine that! avoid at all costs!! monkeys could manage this complex better than the current staff.
this review is for pizini, which i didnt know was part of fat cats. i saw it in passing a few times and finally went in to try out a new italian spot. i went on a friday evening and it was not very busy but there was plenty of seating if it was. the place seemed only to be staffed by people in their late teensearly 20s; that isnt an issue but the level of service and actions you see project how people in that age group would act. you can see the pizza being made and cooked in the pizza oven, which is cool, just like chipotle and other places. i ordered the pollo pesto panini which comes with a side of pasta salad. my order didnt take long however, when i hot home and opened the box, i was surprised that my pasta salad didnt have a lid on it so it was spilled in the box during the trip home.unfortunately, the food was mediocre at best. the tastiest part of it was the cheese. there was no flavor in the chicken or even the pesto. the pasta salad had little to no dressing on it so again, less than flavorful. this visit was disappointing so i will not be back.
its hard to book an event or any kind of information from this place because no one answers the phone not a good thing when youre first starting out in business
went to fc using pogo pass. was told they dont accept after 5 pm on fridays.  they claimed they had no control over the rule, although they are clearly the beneficiaries of such a policy. nowhere on their website is this limitation. theyve lost us as a customer forever. they could have easily recouped any loss of 5 mini golf passes, by any money we would have spent on food, games, etc. bad management decision regardless of whose fault they claim it is.update: they contacted me saying they wanted to fix things. gave them my contact info, weeks have gone by and still havent heard anything.
went to fat cats in gilbert for the first time tonight and will never be back. bought movie tickets and ordered food which we were told would be delivered to us during the movie.  45 minutes later... no food.  went out three times to figure out what happened to our food. kept being promised that wed have our food soon. an hour and twenty minutes after ordering went out again a fourth time and was finally given our lukewarm pizzas. at this point wed missed most of the movie so we asked for our money back so we could just leave. initially they just wanted to give us a  10 gift card so we could try them again. had to explain that wed never be back and finally got our money back for movie rickets and pizza  but not the popcorn we had to buy to have something to eat during the interminable wait. lots of other choices for movies in gilbert  anywhere is better than this place.
just in case you might need pc tech support we highly recommend steven skwarkowski at 7023287960. we needed monitor and pc help and steve was very knowledgable and punctual. his prices are very reasonable and hes a nice guy to deal with.
found him on craigslist and he works from home. prices are ok thats why i called and said it wouldnt take long. i took my laptop and charger to him and said it was going to cost 40 if he fixes it. i called back 5 minutes later and changed my mind so told him i would pick it up, he said he already took it apart. and i was like wtf? how? and why? when  before i left he said he was working on another first the  mine in 1 hour or 2. he didnt want to give it back and i told him its ok ill take it like that. i came home and told him he didnt give me the charger. he said to call later and i did and says he couldnt find a charger and that i was crazy. so i told him to check again and i have him an extra 3 days and still nothing. i went to his house so he can see my face and my laptop because all of a sudden he does not remember me or my laptop. this guy swears he sees many a guys with l.a. hats with tattoos going to him with in 4 days.
arrived at 10:00 am on sunday 726.  waited 5 minutes just to reach the hostess stand to put our name in.  they informed us of a 7590min wait for a 2 top.  half the tables were empty and there were more people standing around inside waiting than seated eating. sadly, we left. not worth that kind of wait for hit and miss reviews from our friends.
who the heck sits people outside in the sun at noon in the desert and then acts rude and indignant because youd rather sit inside!?!? the manager was rude!!! i have no idea what the food taste like and really dont care... i realize its new and very popular right now but they should get a clue and not treat their customers like theyre are doing us a favor... we are not cattle!!!! eco friendly establishments with no misters should not have outside seating during the summer!! way to go not impressing new patrons!!
the wait was ridiculous we waited 40 minutes to be seated. after we had a table i had to grab a server after waiting 20 minutes with nobody acknowledging us. the food was just okay definitely didnt live up to the hype. i dont think well be coming back.
very disappointed! the french toast was cold  soggy. visited on a wednesday morning so there should have been no excuse for this type of a result. new place in gilbert however way too much hype. for breakfast in the east valley im sticking with tc eggingtons or crackers cafe. more bang for the buck and much better food.
awful.. waited 45 mins and got a text that my table was ready and it wasnt?? very unorganized!
fifteen minutes after being seated and the waiter never showed up. no water...... nothing....might try it again if they fix their server issues.
i went in to snooze for the first time today after hearing great things. it was pretty busy and seemed pretty cool. after getting seated i waited for 10 minutes. i was never greeted, so decided to leave and go to dennys. i work as a server, so i know its unacceptable for that to happen, and while i was willing to give benefit of the doubt because of how busy it was, there were for too many people working for that to happen. on the way out i also got the most fake smile ive ever seen. i was very disappointed i didnt eat at snooze, and may try again, but im not tipping a server if i have to flag one down after waiting 10 minutes to be greeted, and as a server thats saying something to not want to tip.
after agreeing to the 3.50 charge to upgrade toast to a gluten free pancake, the pancake showed up with hair cooked into in. never going back.
ok so i have to preface that this review is not for the food. we didnt actually have a chance to eat the food because everything else was so terrible.we arrived at 8:30am on a sunday to grab a breakfast with the kids. we quoted 30 minutes wait for a table. not a problem at all! took the kids across the street to grab some coffee from bergies and to wait. after 40 minutes, go back to check on our time. still a wait....30 minutes after that we finally are sat at a table. after a little bit our server comes over she was very nice but could tell she was hot and stressed out. we place our food and drink order right away together. we wait 40 minutes and food still isnt there. server is no where to be found. water is empty. its now been almost 2 hours since we first arrived and still no food or anything. we ended up getting up from our table and just leaving. i tried to find our server to let her know but again...nowhere to be found. i would highly suggest hiring enough staff to handle the demand you clearly have! i dont know if we will ever attempt to eat here again but if we do, ill update my review.
zero stars.....we got there at 7:00am to beat the rush. there was no wait time and we got seated instantly. thats where the good ends, we sat there for 10 minutes never got water or even a server to let us know they would be right with us. it wasnt busy and didnt seemed under staffed, the reason i say that is there were plenty of servers just huddled around talking and making eye contact with us. so five minutes later we just walked out. the couple right next to us were flustered too and were commenting on the bad service. i now know why there is always long lines at this place. i thought it might have been the food but i guess ill never know.
we had a weekday brunch visit. the food was fine, but our bleach blonde server took to my husband right away and proceeded to flirt with him each time she came to the table, while barely acknowledging me. based on her actions, my husband may as well have been eating alone. for example, after our food was brought to the table, she stood there and inquired with him about something random, staring at him intently, and lingered far too long for our comfort. funny she didnt inquire about his wedding band.  we dine out a lot and have never seen this happen. the audacity of this waitress was shocking.
not impressed with the food at all. ive had better breakfasts at other places. it was just okay. not matts big breakfast in phoenix by a long shot. beautiful restaurant but the hype didnt match the quality.
cant comment on coffee because it never came pancakes french toast was dry hopefully other food is better i will not find out this is a one time stop for me.  very noisy and service well let me put it this way his teeth were beautiful but not the service
worst service!! first i would like to say i never do this. but we were excited to go try it out. got there in time not really busy. had service right away took our order and never saw our waitress again. i had to ask 2 different waiters for drinks.  when they second waiter told our waitress she just looked pissied off. food was terrible not worth 40  we will never go back.. wast of time and money.good luck if you go!
cant comment on coffee because it never came pancakes french toast was dry hopefully other food is better i will not find out this is a one time stop for me.  very noisy and service well let me put it this way his teeth were beautiful but not the service well went back with a different friend both us us vowed never to return and we have not. today i am at the hillcrest snooze in san diego well worth the 5 12 drive their  food makes you feel like you are in heaven and the staff there is fun friendly and on top of things. i can actually say now that the coffee is great at snooze i got it in san diegoand the food was awesome in san diego  l hope the manager goes down to hillcrest snooze to see how shehe should be running her snooze until then i will stay away from gilbert
this place managed to fuck up bacon.another trendy, hip gilbert eatery that lures you in with aesthetics but does not deliver on food. got there really early on a weekday to avoid crowds. there were 4 people chatting at the hostess booth, including one cocky little prick that needed a throat punch. despite this ample staffing, we were ignored until we finally broke up their conversation to ask if we were supposed to seat ourselves. sure, they said. so we did. then waited 10 more minutes for a menu, when i finally went to get them myself. this place is always packed and i cannot figure out why. they do have intriguing pancake flavors but they do not taste as good as they sound, and the rest of the menu is uneventful and overpriced. bland hash browns in a ring mold i instantly hate you. blah eggs. blah toast. extra charge for thick, tough, bizarrely herbal infused bacon. i have never, never not eaten my bacon. the disappointment continued to fester as we had an eternity to stare at our uneaten food and wait for the check. 40 for me and my kid. ya know, if i were a server and noticed that my patrons didnt eat their food, i might ask why, but this chick was far too oblivious. and as i walked out, i noticed the font they used on their hours of operation papyrus! unacceptable!!!!!!
i am writing this review based on service. we went in on a friday morning around 820. there was no wait and a bunch of tables inside or outside. we got a table for 2 inside against the window, sat down and looked at the menu. another party of 2 sits down two tables from us about 5 minutes later. now we are waiting for a waitress to at least take our order or offer us coffee or water. now its about 10 minutes and then the waitress comes and takes the order of the party of 2 and even brought them water. she made about 3 trips to that table and didnt even acknowledge us. its not my job to flag her down .....it wasnt busy and she should have noticed us. its been 20 minutes so my wife and i just get up and say eff this place and go to the farmhouseservice there is excellent got our food in 15 minutes. i will give this place another chance and see if service is still the same but ill make sure ill bring a white person with us so we can get some service. just my opinion.
terrible service and the food was good but didnt make up for the lack of attention...
i will start by saying i dont usually rate so low but hopefully all of the low reviews will prompt the owner or manager to take notice that there is much needed room for improvement. my  son and i had been looking forward to trying snooze since we had seen it under construction. arrived on a friday morning and were surprised to see such a long wait for a weekday, we were in no hurry so we decided to wait it out. about 20 minutes into our wait and having to practically yell at eachother from the loud chatter noise preferring to wait inside as it was blistering hot outside with no misters i was starting to have second thoughts about waiting, but figured the wait would never be shorter on a weekend and we really wanted to try it... 45 minutes later we get seated. service was descent at best. my sons corned beef hash was very tasty but we had ordered our eggs over medium and they were disgustingly runny, neither of us ate them. never got a refill on water nor coffee.  i have never been to an eatery that left me with a headache from yelling across the table to have a simple conversation with my son... but this place managed to do that. neither the long wait, food, service nor loud atmosphere was tempting enough for me to give it another try. it just wasnt that impressive to me. id much rather go to black bear diner or the groves where i can enjoy my breakfast without feeling like im at a rock concert. hope they make improvements before the thrill of trying a new place is gone. cant imagine anyone rushing back to try it again.
very little food for the high prices. free coffee while you wait, but then they offer to switch out your mug without saying that youll be charged for it.
been going here once a week for months and really like it always bring my family and have a great breakfast and good service. went today and that all changed so so fast. service to start was slow for a monday but i am ok with that. my bacon had hair on it and by breakfast pot pie had raw sausage in it. when i cut a piece open it was pink and cold. sent them both back and bacon came back fine not sure if it was the same bacon  the hair but i ate it. the pot pie came back out and cut a piece open and same thing. the waiter explain that per the manager that is the way it is the cook it once and then reheat it. sausage should never be pink and cold. the manager did not even feel the need to come talk to me. well lost a very regular customer.
make sure you dont arrive earlier than the rest of your party, dont expect to have your morning coffee while you are waiting for the last person to arrive. they wont seat you!!!  so, if everyone cant be there early, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else, by the time your party arrives you will have to wait another 30 minutes or more because now all the tables are taken.
so disappointed. i had bookmarked this place awhile ago, but only got to vegas this past weekend. when i went in, i was struck by how barebones everything was and how unimpressive the gelato selections were. i thought to myself, huh? why on earth did i ever bookmark this place? but since i was there, i bought some gelato, which was ok, not great, and left thinking i must have bookmarked the wrong place.upon returning to yelp to write some reviews today, though, i note that i did bookmark the right place  just the one from a few months ago. i wish i had seen the reviews that this place had shut down in february and reopened just this past month and was now completely different. all of the pictures of delectable gelato are out of date. the array of flavors are all gone. this is a completely different place, just simply with the same name and location. it really should have its own new, separate yelp page so as not to trade off of the goodwill and reputation of the previous store.
not cool. its not the same product! but with the same name! they should start this yelp from scratch. very misleading.
this place reopened and is now under new ownership and not at all affiliated with the original head chef, though it uses the same store name. the original chef, desyree, is opening another store, gelatology, this fall in a completely different location.i used to be a huge fan of art of flavors, so hearing that this place reopened caused me to see if it was as good as before.it was not. to keep things short and sweet, this is a completely different establishment than what it was before. the gelato was mediocre at best, and the the quirky flavors were nowhere close to what they were supposed to taste pistachio didnt even taste like pistachio. what a disappointment!. the friendly vibe desyree brought to the shop was completely gone, and i honestly left feeling cheated with my experience.i cannot wait until desyree opens up her shop so we could finally have some outstanding gelato back in vegas. this place is now a joke. it should have opened up as a completely new establishment, one that did not bring the reputation and ratings along with it, despite the same name.
definitely not the same gelato. yelpers need to know that it is under new management. my kids didnt finish their gelato and they used to ask for seconds.
attention!  under new ownership!  original owner, desyree is no longer there!  i guess i should have known when the place was a complete ghost town.  walked in, gelato flavors didnt look the same and no one was in sight, not even at the counter.  a man finally walked out, took our order and that was that. never offered us a sample or anything...something desyree would do when anyone walked in. my son got the chocolate which was bitter in taste.  i had to mix some of my gelato chocolate chip with it so he could eat it. how do you get chocolate wrong?  there were no interesting flavors and the gelato was nothing special.  sad the place still looks the same and has the same name but its not.  this place received amazing reviews because of desyree. our family wont be going there anymore.
im not sure what exactly they serve here, but its not gelato.  its kinda sorta looks like gelato in the case, but the consistency is all wrong.  whereas authentic gelato has very little air whipped into it, which creates the smooth creamy texture because there isnt that much butterfat either, art of flavors gelato must have been hooked up to a bicycle pump sometime during the cooking process.  the texture is bad enough, but the flavors are far far worse.  i tried a 12 oz. cup with 3 scoops:  pistachio, bacio chocolate hazelnut, and white chocolate macadamia.  all three flavors had that weird chemically taste of artificial flavorings, and all three were much too sweet and i have a wicked sweet tooth, mind you.  if you have a nut allergy, you could probably eat all three flavors i had without medical incident because im pretty sure there were no actual pistachios, hazelnuts, or macadamias involved at any stage in the gelatomaking process.what really took the cake was that for this cheap, faux gelato, art of flavors is charging premium prices!  5.99 for 12 ounces of dq soft serve chockfull of artificial flavors?!  wait, thats not fair ... dq soft serve actually isnt as bad as this stuff, and its certainly not as expensive.  art of flavors gelato, on the other hand, is truly awful.  and to add insult to injury, its absurdly overpriced.  stay away!!
follow the original owner to gelatology on south rainbow....this art of flavors is a cheap imposter!
if you want a hairdresser who will not listen to you, who thinks she knows what you want better than you do, and who will not do what you want done, then this is the place for you!  this is a onewoman operation.  her name is terri rodman.  i saw a woman in a grocery store and liked the color of her hair.  she referred me to terri whom had been doing her hair for many years.  my husband and i have had trouble finding a hairdresser who will listen and do what we ask to be done instead of what they think needs to be done. its our hair, our money and our decisions!we both went to her the same day.  he needed his mustache dyed  trimmed and his hair trimmed.  i needed my hair weaved and trimmed.  we talked to her at length when we made the appt. explaining what we wanted and our frustrations in the past.  she agreed to do everything we asked, yet did not...but she did do everything we asked her not to do! first of all, terri had been doing the womans hair for years, so she knew the color i wanted.  i also sent her a photo of another persons hair color that i liked.  when we were in her salon, she had a product on display that the model also had the hair color i wanted...thats three references of basically the exact same color!!! i stressed that i didnt like yellow blonde, that i prefer a white shade of blonde like the three references btw, terris hair is yellow blonde...maybe a little competitiveness??  my hair ended up light brown...no blonde...yellow or white!i also told terri i wanted my hair shiny. she talked me into a treatment that she normally charges 50 for, but because of all the other services we were getting, she would only charge me 25.  my hair did not shine nor look any different than when i walked in the door as though nothing had been used.  a definite rip off!she trimmed my husbands mustache exacly how we had explained in great detail we did not want it done and why.  it was also gray again in less than a week.  he called her, and she couldnt get him in until today. she told him he needed to go buy some otc brand designed specifically for mustaches...but did not offer to refund his money!  she reluctantly redyed it and did a lousy job...half of it is still gray!   i asked her about my color which i had done the day she weaved it, and she convinced me that it was lighter than i thought. it wasnt. we were leaving town the next day to attend my husbands mothers memorial in oh, so nothing could be done anyway.today, i held up a part of my hair to the product display that was one of my references to show her the drastic difference in color, and she said that what i wanted couldnt be done.  then why did she try it in the first place and charge me 125???and, when i asked her today about the nonexistant shine, she said you cant get straw to shine.  first of all, my hair is not damaged, its just not shiny, but what a pro to say that!!  and, if that were true, why did she try it and charge me for that also??she was rude, offensive and very unprofessional today.  i would give her zero stars if possible.  be afraid.  be very afraid.  oh...she only takes cash.  guess thats so no one has any recourse to get their money back.
went to get my shellac replaced as i was already in westmount square and it was convenient...told the lady my shellac being removed was soak off. she let them soak for not even 2 minutes and proceeded to kill my nails with the drillelectric filer that totally ruins natural nails. i told her to stop approximately 5 times and she refused. i am a shy person so it took a lot for me to even say anything and i really wanted to walk out but could not find the courage to. anyways, 4 days pass and three of my nails break to the point where it hurts and my nails should not be that long. i bled. on every nail. i will discourage everyone i know from going to this place. disgusting lack of care for paying customers body parts.
this use to be the location for brightchild which is the place i had a previous review for. this review will be for the current kidz kidz kidz... they came in and there were a lot of changes made... a lot of the old teachers left, new policies came into play, new directors came in, new charges , fees . there is no communication between the staff parents here. we were promised that when the changes were made the prices would stay the same.. and then one day they just tried to tell us on monday if we wanted our daughter to continue we would have to pay more. bottom line, they are providing daycare type care, not learning center care. our daughter isnt learning anything. and she is extremely smart. she is 4 years old and all this place does is have her color all day and an occasional arts and craft. she use to look forward to cereal at school and the school started providing apple sauce for breakfast. i provided some pictures of what my child was bringing home to me... i did bring it to the current directors attention... she did say she would fix it.. however then told me our tuition was changing the next day... how about u fix the problem and then talk to me about tuition?! my daughter lost so many of her friends once this company took over... it was hard for her. im surprised i stuck with them as long as we did. another parents little boy who is under 2 years of age had an accident and broke his femur while playing , while in their care and he no longer attends either. lots of parents have left.
this place is a joke, 1 pm over 12 people simply sitting around waiting for food and the staff walking back and forth yelling knife, knife walking. 20 minutes later and i asked for a refund, its a sub for gosh sakes. never coming back to this one thats for sure. one star because there is nothing lower.
sooo disappointed, the staff has no sense of urgency! i was there a few weeks ago and waited 25 min for 1 sandwich! today only 15 min wait but when i got home my order was wrong!!!
let me first start out by saying that this is my very first yelp review. i do not like giving negative reviews because everyone deserves to have a bad day or a rough moment.      when first walking into the store i had a great experience. i came into the store with my boyfriend to look for a couch for my new living room area. the salesman showed us around the floor and we actually found a large sectional couch that i instantly fell in love with. the guy was super nice. my experience in the store changed very quickly when the salesman tried to call the managerowner over to speak with us. stopping to look at couches was spontaneous and since my boyfriend had driven, i left my wallet and id at home.       i think they must have assumed that my boyfriend was going to be buying the furniture because he was the man, however they were wrong. my father recently passed away and he left me a wonderful house. the manager would not come over, he stopped about 50ft away and shouted across the store about how he will not discuss the furniture with me and that no one in 2015 leaves their wallet or id at home.  i can understand being a salesman. i am positive that many people come into the store and waste their time by looking at furniture and then never actually purchasing it. that was not what this man was dealing with here. if he was kind to me i would have been back the morning and purchased his 2000. sectional couch. however, that is not how i was treated. i did not get a handshake or a friendly smile, just some rude sexist assumptions and a badgering comment.         he lost my business. i would not suggest going here. i would go to a furniture store with a better reputation and  more positive atmosphere. that is what i did today and i receive excellent service from rc wiley.
slowest place ever. terrible customer service. all the workers just sit there while one person works.
third time in a row i have been here and there are no pizzas available.  bad for customer service....ill continue to go down las vegas blvd where ive always been in and out. very disappointed
slowest service ever!  they kept serving the people coming in ahead of 3 of us who were here first.  unprofessional, everyone was cussing and joking around and they forgot to make bread in the middle of all of that...waited 45 min for 3 pizzas, wings and a crazy bread.  definitely not coming back...
terrible customer service. checkedin online indicating no wait. arrived at location, with two customers getting haircuts and four stylists present. told the receptionist i checkedin online but the wait time would be ten minutes.after waiting ten minutes with one customer getting a haircut and three other stylists doing nothing, i told the receptionist to cancel my appointment. at that time, i was told i would be taken immediately. too late. i left. will never return to this location.
wish i didnt have to give a no stars went on thursday to have my little boys  he is 2 haircut i have been there once before and angie did his hair the first time so i was happy to see her that on thursday before she sat us down i asked her to save the hair from the cut cause daddy throw the frist haircut out by mistake she no problem even went and got something to put the hair in we sat down she asked what i wanted i told her to cut about 2 inches off the top and trim the back cause i wanted to keep my sons curls the next than i know she had cut all my sons curls off and while she was cutting the curls off she said lets cut this so he doesnt look like a girl it was to late for me to say anything cause they all was gone!!! when i asked her why she cut the back and the curls off she said well theres nothing we can do now we have to move forward needless to say i was pissed!!!! i asked her to walk away and let me have time to cool down she than step toward me and says this is her station after some talking and yes cussing back and forward the other lady name sarah finished cutting my sons hair as we was leaving by this time she was cutting someone else hair she stop what she was doing came to the counter and said here take some coupons for windshield wipers and put them in my purse i told i didnt want the coupons she than asked if my son can have a sucker i told her no she then walks for behind the counter and asked my son if he wants one and when i said  no again my son  like most 2 year old had a meltdown throwing himself backwards hitting his head on the concrete the coworker sarah said angie stop!!! i asked sarah if she would get me sons hair that angie saved before all hell broke lose thats when angie with a smile on her face says thats she throw it away!!!!! call the manager on friday   cause she wasnt there on thursday  all she offer me was a free haircut and says for me to make angie isnt working that day.  she needs to fired!!!!
bad service. spoke with the person that runs the place and got hung up on. will never deal with them again.
i had him replace the coil on my ac unit. he put in an oversized unit that caused my crawlspace ductwork to constantly drip water. he refused to fix it and i had to get it corrected by a qualified hvac contractor. he even installed the oversized unit incorrectly. waste of time and money. he wont even attempt to live up to his 1 yr guarantee and its only been a month!
might be the worst manicure i have ever gotten. made an appointment for a gel mani and gel pedi.  melissa is very nice, but her manicures are not. to begin with, the selection of colors is a basketful of less than 20 stickybottled colors. i choose one that was closest to what i intended to get. the pedicure was okay. the manicure was pretty bad. there is polish on my cuticles and the base edge on each nail is erratic. i pointed this out to her, but she did not fix it. the worst part was that i showed her a picture of the nail shape i wanted from pinterest, which was not an unusual shape, and she didnt even come close. she filed in the sides and made my nails look tiny and pointy, not anything like the rounded nails i showed her several times. i hated the look so much that filed them down to almost nothing when i got home. melissa is a very nice woman and maybe she is great at hair, but not so much for nails. and it was pricey even though she gave me her groupon price!! never again.
pleasant woman and very friendly, but my and my mothers gel manicure and pedicure is not good. at all. there is polish all over our cuticles and the skin around our nails when i told melissa that the corners of my nails felt sharp and it inhibits my job she barely ran the file over them and quickly moved on. i had an absolutely beautiful manicure that had just grown out that she had me soak in acetone for about an hour and did not even remove all of the polish when she was grinding my remaining polish off yes, it was gel polish not acrylic so i have a few lumpy areas and air bubbles. basically we were both just very disappointed all around. :
so, i think maybe i went in with too high of expectations. all these amazing reviews and the boys own description of their shop had me all starry eyed. they do not sell unique plants not a single one. same goes for the pots. standard houseplants, a couple air plants, and some scrawny looking cacti. they had several ikea pots i wish it wasnt so but alas they had them scattered throughout out the small space. i will attach a picture of the ikea sadness. so much for being unique bosque.
oddly listed as cakes by elen on yelp, despite still featuring cakes de la flore signage and website, it is almost impossible to believe how rude the two men running this bakery were on friday, accosting me with questions of why you take pictures the second i stepped in the door  a photo of the exterior snapped just moments after getting out of my car.explaining to them that i take photos of what i eat and maintain a blog, i was immediately told we dont want your pictures, we dont need your help  download them from the website and sensing unnecessary hostility i explained that the none of the items on the shelves remotely resembled the fine pastry online, a suggestion that the men neednt be so rude quickly prompting them to ask me to leave  me uttering the word ahole and a middle finger my parting gift from behind the counter as i pulled away from the curb.
i unfortunately didnt have the same good experience as the last posters. something that is important to me are fixed prices posted for the customer to see without having to ask the price. they dont post any prices?! this leads me to perceive that they may change the price on the whim, to make certain revenues for the day. i was charged 20 for a trim; nothing too difficult and the barber took a very long time to complete my trim. he said he has 10 years of experience so i was surprised by the exceptionally slow pace i am usually in and out in 1520 minutes. they also still dont have their charge machine up and running, so they only take cash.  i had to leave, go to the atm and then go back. which was rather inconvenient. i would never go back.
we went to check it out but we were not greeted as we came in or when we sat to order a drink. finally a guy shouted that he would be with us on a minute. we waited but he did not return. there was only four or people in the place so he was not busy. i believe if we were hispanic and not a white couple we would have been waited on . discrimination is what happened here. the next time i go back is when you are closing your doors to say good riddens to another crappy casino.
i have visited the new strawberry fields 3 times in the past month and each experience has been a bit sad, but this morning was the saddest of them all.  upon driving up, the door on the cafe side was propped open but the sign on the stores doors said they were closed, yet their hours said they were opened.  the lights were all turned off.  i tried the doors and they were locked. i walked into the cafe, half expecting that the person at the counter would tell me that the store was closed, as each time i went into the store prior to this morning, there was never another customer.  the person operating the cafe seemed a bit confused.  i asked if the store was open, trying to assess if i could shop and was then asked do you have a question?  i explained that the lights are off, doors locked, and the sign says they are supposed to be open.  i was told i could shop and check out at the cafe.   in the dark, i rummaged through the store to find the items i went in for.  in the mean time, the back room behind the cheese counter, had several employees chatting it up, never turning to see that there was a customer, the lights were off and the doors locked.i found my items and went to the cafe to check out.  the person at the cafe apologized for the stores amateur performance.  he explained that this is not the first time this has happened.  outside of customer service issues, the prices are a bit high.  strawberry fields prices were always higher and for some items, i have been willing to pay the price, but im afraid i am done shopping at strawberry fields and instead will support other local health food stores.  the operation of the store is embarrassing.  i dont expect this store to stay open with such high prices, disorganization, and poor customer service.  as much as i wanted to see the store survive, it is an embarrassment to the name. i much prefer the coop, natural gourmet, the farmers market, regular grocery stores, amazon, gardening or even fasting in comparison to the experiences ive had at the new and not so improved strawberry fields.
be very careful about the new strawberry fields. the prices are higher, with expired food on the shelf including milk. 9 a gallon for expired milk. i wouldnt buy anything that isnt factory sealed and dated from there if food gets left out that long which kind of defeats the point of a natural food store, doesnt it?they brag about their new cafe. by the way, unless they specifically say the cafe food is organic, it isnt. sometimes you find some extra pricey stuff marked organic in the cafe area thats your clue. thats the only stuff that was that day. yep, the bakery and coffee areas say they use all organic ingredients, but the cafe doesnt.  in a natural food store. was pretty ticked to realize that.of course, for that to be a problem you have to find them on a day they actually opened on time. got there once and the lights were all off, bakery and coffee open. heard that this happens a lot, either no one was scheduled to work the opening shift, or no one showed up for the regular store, i guess.if youre lucky, you can be like me and  hear the manager come out and yell bizarre paranoid commands at employees and customers. like how the employees are smiling too much. seriously thought the dude was going to yell at me for having a good day. really puts the 9 rotten milk in perspective. i think a lot is rotten there that we dont see.during the old days, used to go there about once a month for special items. never again. never, ever, ever, ever again. frankly, makes me worry about buying stuff at this familys other store.
just want to point out that there are not all new employees, at least not originally the new owners originally hired back the entire old crew. then proceeded to fire or force most of them to quit. seriously, ask people who used to work there about why people have fled this place like rats from a sinking ship. its kind of hilarious. one poor gal was fired for trying a tiny sample cup of a new deli product. fired by the same manager who later that day asked employees what they thought of the new product.
i went to see the store under its new owner. im so hurt that its lost the appeal. the prices are ridiculously high, no cars in the lot and a few of us wandering through the isles searching for a reason that this new owner would trip at least the prices for the products. maybe hell just write off this business. im voting for trader joes and i will continue to support common ground. what a disappointment.
the one star is not necessarily because of the service which was okay anyways. if you have a large sign outside that says 20 off special than you should be honoring that. not saying that you cant get anyone to come to take the sign down. he also told me that there would be new management shortly so that they will have that special again next month. so i came in for service because of the special, the place was dead and i get charged full price when there is a sign outside for a discount?!? thats why i came here in the first place! im never coming back again. second time ive been here and i was the only one in the salon. clearly shows why. unbelievable. even the guy who did my nails said that he will not be here the next time i come in. not that i will be back but..... seriously?!? i want my money back! or at least the discount that i was meant to receive. he told me the current owner is tammy. tammy.... i want my 20 refund.... at least. what a hoax.
that had to of been one of the saddest sandwich experiences of my life. first off it took an inordinate amount of time to go through the drivethrough. it was 10 bucks for a sandwich with chips and a drink. they totally skipped on the protein of the sandwich and it was basically a giant piece of bread with a lot of veggies. mine was supposed to have pesto on it and i didnt get even a hint of pesto.  ill be heading back to jimmy johns where they dont skimp on the protein in the sandwich.

dont spend your money at adams nails  spa!!!! run! dont walk!  today i was so looking forward to going to adams nail spa. i had tried it about a month ago. i understand it is under new ownership. the first time i experience  a pedicure with an older vietnamese nail technician. she was so wonderful and i thought she was the new owner. today i came back thinking it would be a great new place to get my manicures and pedicures.  there were nail technicians that i have not seen before.  i had an unbelievably stressful experience. i came to have my nails and a pedicure.  the entire time i felt like i was being rushed.  i felt like car being pushed through a carwash it was so stressful the lady who did my nails whos name is tina was very impatient and grunted at me the entire time as she was standing over me and giving me a manicure. the place only had one other customer. while i was getting a pedicure from a young man who seemed like he was new to the industry. he seemed like he was getting started in this field because the other nail technicians kept telling him to do it different. he didnt have much experience which i was okay with.   i asked the gentleman several times fix what he missed, eventually they had an older lady step  in and she did a fabulous job.  in that process i was having my nails done and instead of taking me to a station to do my nails tina hovered over me and was very abrasive with the process. she kept digging her nails into my hand and squeezing my fingers so hard that my fingers were starting to turn blue. when tina got done with my nails i noticed that the polish by my cuticles were not filled in with the color and it looked very disheveled so i asked her to please fill those in. she did do that with a very nasty attitude towards. tina kept pulling my hand towards her and kept on grunting at me and tapping where she needed my hands to be instead of asking me to place my where she needed them. i tried to talk to the establishment about my experience and ask them to talk to her. my experience was three other technicians standing and arguing with me and making excuses for tina.  i will never do my business there again and i implore you not to spend your money there. you will feel more stress leaving that establishment then when you arrived there.  i would never wish this upon anyone!  please excuse any typos and or run on sentences i am not the best at writing.
went there with a group of 7 for champagne brunch on a saturday.  the seated all of us at a table made for 6 in front of the place that had a couple of metal signs right next to us.  every time half of us got up to eat we had to go around them.  the hostess also embarressed one of the ladies in our group.  she said champagne comes with the buffet but not for you since you are expecting and she is not pregnant.  that comment ruined her meal, her day and the rest of her trip.  not to mention that we had to hear about it for the rest of the trip.  the food wasnt too bad except for the crab legs.  i am not sure if they were old or just not prepared correctly but the meat was sticking to the inside of the shells so it was almost impossible to eat.  i have been to las vegas multiple times and with all of the dining options for 25 i would skip this place next time.
this was awful and i was drunk, which is really saying something. only half the stuff was labeled. the fried chicken needed to be dipped in water to make it edible. desserts were terrible too. stay away, spend your 24 elsewhere.
gross.  well done prime rib.  unseasoned food.  missing several items that were advertised.  pasta station not open.
i wish i could confidently support this place but the majority of the food was either dry, cold and lacked flavor.  the tables around us were left dirty, wrappers and paper napkins left on the floor.  i saw the a rated signs they received and i am perplexed at how and who they had visit this buffet.  dont waste your money.  run away if someone tells you to eat here.
horrible waitress.....never do i do bad reviews but ill make an exception. went there tonight, it was prob my third time there. good environment good food.but tonight was horrible. went with my boyfriend  we sat in a 4 people table. took the waitress about 15 min to come by to get our drink order. she seemed angry but we ignored it. brought back drinks prob 10 min after that. not exaggerating then i ordered a burger well done burger comes back with red. i tried to get the waitresses attention but every time i did it was always the one min response. finally i stopped trying to call her over. she finally came to the table,no joke about 15 min later to ask how everything was. at this point i was over impatient. so my boyfriend ordered another beer  i decided to get one as well. also decided to re order my burger. 7 min later my food comes burnt patty literally burnt.!!!! i didnt even bother with the food anymore. yet our beers no where to found. she comes back 5 min later asking us if we would mind if 2 people sat with us, at this point i was irritated  in no fault was it the people who were waiting for a table fault but i was so angry with the waitress already i told her no, i dont want anyone sitting with us keep in mind these are 4 people tables small  cramped tables.... she continued with the worst attitude and says too bad we need to fill up the bar.. seriously what was the point of asking then.? i was beyond livid. my boyfriend just said ok i guess we will be okay with two strangers here.. just bring us our beers that we ordered 20 min ago  she said she forgot.!!!! really.?! she was the worst waitress i had ever dealt with.. when we were heading out the people in the next table said yea we feel the same way about her, we are heading out too becca was the name on the receipt. horrible service from her. not going back because of her. dont say you werent warned.
i dont care if the food is good or not. i ordered two orders of fries and when i asked for a cup of water, they simply said we dont have water cups. im sorry but to not provide paying customers with water in the desert is just bs. to make it worse i was told jimmy johns next door has water cups. come on guys. thats just terrible service.
the most horrible experience i have ever had.  hands down the most dishonest  car salesmen ive ever seen. i bought a truck from them and it was utter crap. cost thousands in repairs one month after purchase. the problem is that most of the things wrong with it were hidden from the naked eye like rust inside the injectors and tie rods that were so worn that if they had fallen apart while driving, they couldve killed me and everyone else on the road. i tried to go into mediation with them but nick is a liar and has had problems with the irs so why would i think he would go into mediation with me? he avoided me like the plague. i will be filing a complaint about this company with dmv. if anyone has had any problems with them, please file a complaint with dmv and help to penalize them it only takes 3 complaints.  i am not going to give up and walk away from this. im leaving reviews on the internet and i am also filing the dmv complaint and taking it to small claims court since he is avoiding arbitration. know your rights and do not allow these charlatans to take advantage of you. my mistake was costly, yours doesnt have to be.  avoid like the plague !!!!!!
worst deal ever. bought a mini cooper from salesman promise to fix the lock and the window. only did the window and refuse to fix the lock. dishonest and not trust worthy.
too bad zero stars isnt an option.  it really needs to be, but that would be too many even for this place.  i took my dodge ram diesel in because it was acting sluggish and not shifting right and they told me it needed a new transmission for 4,000!  i took it to aamco for a second opinion, and they discovered a blown hose clamp that cost about 5 to fix.  avondale dodge tried to steal 4,000 from me!!!  do not ever go here unless you enjoy being lied to, cheated, and stolen from!!!!  also, please read their filtered reviews!  all are obviously real people that are also really upset.
the sales people were good people, the service department takes 3 hours for an oil change, rotation and balance...even though i scheduled an appointment. if you dont want to be here all day wake up early and get here before they open up. edit: after waiting 3 hours i drive off and 10 minutes later my tire blows out...i proceed to drive back to avondale dodge service. i tell them what happened and they proceed to tell me that it wasnt there fault  i need to buy a new tire. although i bought the car,tiresonly 12k on them from them and they worked on the tires 15 minutes prior even going as far as to say i have 15k at least left on the tires it is no way shape or form there fault. im absolutely disgusted by how the manger acted. said and i quote  if you get in an accident when you drive away from here is that our fault as well?... the customer service is abysmal and i will never buy dodge again solely based on the events of there representatives actions today. its not like it happened a week after or hell even a day...it happened 10 minutes after they worked on the tire... i will make sure i talk to somebody whos higher up monday morning.
well little more of an update now a few weeks after the first blow out of my tire i had another one blow out for no reason while driving so i replaced it. i go back to this place for oil change and auto butler which i personally think was the first time they legitimately did even though i been there to have it done numerous times,but that a different story for a different day.i told them i would be going on a long trip and to make sure everything is good tires,brakes etc. they said everything was great and i just needed a filter. i got the filter and proceeded to take an 700 mile trip.during the trip i could feel my vehicle pulling significantly to the right more than the usual youll get my vehicle was also shaking. i just had an alignment and balancing less than 3k miles before. i took my car to a les shwab tire center in california and told them the issue, they immediately identified the issue, the tires i had got from the dealership and two that already blew out were not wide enough for the actual rim! they showed me the wear the two original tires had after only 18k and said it was only a matter of time before they blew out as well! not only did i go into this dealership a week prior and they said everything was good they gave me tires that were not the correct width putting my safety and safety of others at risk for an accident! i have now spent over 1k on tires on a vehicle with less than 20k miles. ill be completely honest i regret buying my vehicle solely based on the inept maintenance people. you pay a premium because your suppose to trust these guys because they work on your type of car everyday but i will not get anything besides oil changes and auto butler here anymore. also the auto butler thing if you see them drive your car through their car wash and your car comes out 5 minutes later for you to pick up then they didnt do the auto butler!
i called 4 days ahead to get my van serviced, the service advisor stated,  we need our certified  promaster mechanic here for it, scheduled for saturday. i bring it in friday evening, so they could have it all day if needed. the same guy that scheduled the appointment, acted like he knew nothing about it. and his own employee states in front of me, you set the appointment, robert. i make my living in this van and cant afford to schedule time off, to have some incompetent individual, screw it up! do yourselves a favor and find another service center!!!! oh and i should also mention for the last 15 years have always been a faithful dodgeram guy... i own 3 new dodgeram vehicles... they will be my last!
this place is a joke starting from there service technicians to make a long story short they quoted me 4000 said i had all these problems  and were quick to try to give 1500 for my 2010 avenger and get me in a new car what a joke would never buy a dodge again thx to these crooks beware everyone  taking your ride for services  there oh yea when u contact  all the big shots they dont do anything all excuses to screw hard working americans way to go dodge
i start off by saying i show up once and they hounded me for months. then when i do attempt a loan, they never bothered calling me or my wife back to explain anything about the deal and whether or not it could be done. so i called them after almost two days and got a sales manager who said he would look into it and call me, he never did. so i call arthur back since he hadnt called me either original salesperson and he had a nonnonchalant attitude about not being able to help us. then he lies about my sons fico score to try and make it look worse as his scores are way higher then he stated to me on the phone, just very unprofessional. ok.. so fucking call the person and tell them, dont string someone along and not call them back when you say you will, the sales managers are horrible which explains why the sales people are too.. very unprofessional people there at avondale dodge.
high hopes but sadly disappointed. not expensive but added up quickly. girls seemed like theyd rather be anywhere but there with a splash of conceitedness. we asked if the habanero guacamole was really spicy or just had a hint of the flavor and the employee said it wasnt spicy at all. so for 6.00 we got it and the portion was ridiculously small. robertos gives more food than that and actually would have rather gone there . the portions were way smaller than expected especially bc the heavier set girl said they were big enough to share. wrong.
shrimp tasted like white rubber, inedible. beef tasted like jerky. black beans had no flavor, like out of the can.  better options nearby. did not have drinks.
i went to this place with my friend was waste a money and time ,first restaurant experience the  both doors of the bunisses was close in bunisses hours with costumes inside the place,we had to get the atention of the server that was on the patio with the patio door close inside to to open the door for us than we went to buy our food the ladie on the cashier offered a terrible customer service, we said ok lets sit down and wait  for the food .the food did not taste good and was grease we couldnt eat that .we did ate the chips and the guacamole was ok.while we were eating chips and guacamole  a man did clean 4 tables with the same smelling dirty rag.so we decide to leave the place and again the both doors inside and patio was close again.what a disaster.im sorry for the bad review it is honest and truthful i know this place just open i hope them can fix the issues plus the doors for the safety of the customers and workers.
i was going on a first date, and my date told me to meet her at boca park for some drinks. i wanted to go to kona but she said she wanted to try this new mexican place. its about as tacky as a spencers gift shop, the food was highly over priced taco bell i actually think taco bell is better, and i hate taco bell, the drinks were a joke. i paid 10 bucks a margarita for what was pretty much ice and lime juice. the staff seemed like they wanted to jump off a building. but i guess if i worked at a worse chipotle i would too.
let me start off with the most important part of the review,the food. my wife and i ordered an array of tacos, the ribeye taco, kung pow shrimp taco, barbacoa taco, the chicken taco. ribeye taco was dry this is their version of carne asada. we also had the mango habanero guacamole. the flavor had no hints of mango taste like regular guacamole. the rest of the tacos were greasy overpriced and had little seasoning. the restaurant is known for inventing the original margarita, so i thought id give it a try. they definitely want to charge you for the history and a margarita was quite underwhelming. now onto the service. number one, the manager never checked to see if our food was any good and asked us if this was our first time, which replied yes it was. the order taker thinks speed equates to service my wife and i could not understand a thing that was coming out of her mouth. the food expediter didnt explain one taco and placed my wifes napkin in the guacamole and just walked off. please do not waste your time with this restaurant.
located in the old embers space in boca park, this place offers no reason to return.  10 for 2 tacos.  do i need to write more?  ok.  the woman behind the counter  it is fast food, akin to chipotle or cafe rio  told me the tacos are very large..worth the price.  not.  the carnitas taco was flavorful, the fried avocado taco was not.  neither was large  about the size of a street taco if you are familiar.  do yourself a favor and go to cafe rio or chipotle  cheaper and better.  i was not drinking, so i didnt try the best margarita in town.  maybe thats worth coming back for.
i dont often leave behind a whole plate of food ive paid for and look for a second restaurant for dinner. thats exactly what i did at hussongs. my wife and i ordered chicken nachos, steak tacos, chips and guacamole, and tried all of their salsas at the salsa bar. my wife and i only ate half of a steak taco, three nacho chips, two bites of guacamole, and a few dips of salsa. everything but the chips was terrible. the chips were just standard low end chips.the nachos, chicken, and salsas can be summed up with the phrase, what is that flavor? for the chicken it was something red that doesnt quite taste like tomatoes. for the fresca salsa it was something that tasted like tomatillo but not, and was much stronger. for the hotter salsas it was something that reminded me of a mole, a deep rich flavor that clashed hard with the salsa. for the nachos it was a combo of whatever makes the chicken gross and something green that i have no idea what to compare to. the steak tacos were a complete joke. easily some of the lowest quality meat weve had. even by mexican restaurant standards. we werent expecting filet or ribeye, but this meat was just pure gristle and tendon. totally unacceptable. finally the guacamole. it might as well have been a bowl of cilantro. there was so much cilantro it was completely inedible for both of us. my wife looked at me incredulously when i called it inedible. sometimes when it comes to cilantro i can exaggerate a bit. so she took a bite, looked at me with a funny look on her face, and said, wow, youre right: inedible.in the end  about 4 minutes after the beginning  we got up, still hungry, and walked away from a stillfull table of terrible food.i lost 30 so you dont have to. youre welcome.
1st, i swear the beans are hormel chilli. ..which is just ew for a supposed mexican place. just no. why? the rice has no flavor for cilantro lime...chipotle is better.  2nd the margaritas are awesome and strong maybe so you get drunk and forget that the beans are probably chilli from a can?. so, go here fo the bar and not for the beans. the steak tacos were good but we just couldnt get over the beans and rice...yuck! even worse that they had the nerve to put those godforsaken  beans and rice in my husbands burrito. double yuck!
totally fell in love w this place last week , then we went in today for thursday night game .. well the whole staff was different very sad cause it didnt compare to last weeks staff.. not only did the bartender spill a full beer on my wife she had the balls to yell out to everyone we had a whooping 16 dollar bill it was happy hour btw .. she couldnt apologize or comp or take care of the fact she spilled a full beer on my wife , just in case i forgot to mention it .. again not coming back again .. parkway tavern wins again
what a joke!!! after a lovely date night with my husband, we decided to stop and watch the football game and have a couple beers. the female bartender not only spills my beer on the bar, it spilled all over my phone, my purse and me.... she only was concerned about my phone and the bar countertop. she didnt offer to wipe my purse or offer to give me a towel to dry myself up. i had to ask for one. and to top it off, charged me for it!!! good job bartender!! a comped beer wouldve been the right thing to do.....
worst customer service....my wife asked for flour tortillas as she ordered and was told no next time its too late...it didnt end there ill never waste my time or money going back...staff needs more customer service training...food was ok but not up to par for boca park
what gives vegas? not a single mexican joint worth a shit in this town, this one included. how hard is it to make mexican food!? apparently real damn hard in sin shitty.
we wait for at least 10min they not even offer is a water... we just leave....  bad customer service and also i went to the taco register they just ignore us.
changing the name from cabanas to the prescott does not change how bad this complex is. unless mark taylor is planning to gut the property and redo everything its still the same horrible complex with a new paint job. fire, flood, broken ac, no screens, bugs, threats of towing for having an old car. worst place ive ever lived.
these are by far the worst apartment complex ive ever lived at, the ac is always out when in az is ridiculously hot, they take ages to fix things. theres always some plumbing work they have to do therefore you cant use your water for a whole day. if you have friends or family dont move in here because theyll never be able to visit you. theres only 12 visitor parking spots which by the way are all taken by residents here but cant get a pass from the office because its only a car per person. when you have a question regarding updates the management is making, the staff always responds with to be honest i dont know their responses are always negative i cant, no, theres nothing i can do instead of giving you some options. if you work after office hours and you forgot to put money in the prepaid card to wash your clothes forget it theres no way you can wash your clothes because the machine is inside the office. in the mornings theres always noise by either the plumbers or people who are blowing the leafs at like 6am theyre not considerate at all, but we have to be understanding but when the residents are having an issue the staff cannot be understanding. thye thought that by changing the names from cabana on thomas from prescott on thomas the bad reviews would go away, but its still as bad as if not worse! everytime someone writes a bad review the manager replies back with an im sorry if theres anything i can do come down to the office but still theres nothing they will do for you. when you first come here they want you to move in so bad, everyone is so nice, but once they have you they dont care at all about the residents, all they care about is your money.
walked in, checked out the menu and went to order. i think i bothered the girl talk g orders because she had that what?! look on her face. i asked for a. steak plate and she replied were out of steak, read the sign as she pointed to a the hand written sign taped to the register.  sorry to have bugged.
this review is not based on the food, as the lack of customer service drove me away before i could order food.i sat down at the bar, after a lesson with madison log rolling across the street awesome experience!, at approximately 7:10 p.m. on a thursday.  there were four or five other guests at the bar, and the restaurant was about 13 full.  i looked at the menu for about a minute or two, then set it down and looked up.  what i saw when i looked up were two bartenders maybe one bartender and one server who were chatting it up.  they both sorta looked my way, without actual eye contact, and then went about their business of chatting, placing a glass in the dishwasher, straightening up menus a the cash register.  okay, i thought to myself, ill wait a bit longer and then one of them will make eye contact and then i can indicate im ready to order.  nope.  no eye contact, in fact, it appeared they tried to avoid turning in my direction.  no, i was not sitting in a corner at the back end of the bar, i was sitting in the open at the front of the restaurant.  at this point, i was hungry and pissed, so i walked out.  i was not going to spend my hardearned money on bartenderservers who dont know how to take care of customers.  i headed back to the capital and spent my money there.
always order weiner schnitzel when i go to a german restaurant  its my favorite. have lived in germany so know good schnitzel.  what was put down in front of me was a piece of meat with globs of red cabbage covering the whole piece.  i like red cabbage but wanted to taste the meat  not the cabbage juice on the meat.  the potatoes were cold and covered with globs of onions.  when i said i preferred tasting the meat our waitress told me the restaurant was doing modern german food  whatever that means. the pretzels and mustard were very tasty along with the beer i ordered.  but my meal didnt look at all like the picture in the ad!!!!
