ok our friends recommended this place. last tuesday i took my daughter and grandbaby. holy cow... amazing! brian, our server was the absolute best... first class all the way. today we went back again, of course with brian. the shrimp napoli is beyond delicious. the lunch special again was superb, pasta yoladina ??? so good, i had it for the second time. the lasagna is forget about it. lobster bisque... wow. but my one year old grandbaby loves the bread, shrimp, kids chicken parmesan and brian. very kid friendly. this is such. find!!! did i mention the shrimp and bread??? omg we finally have a five star italian place in our neighborhood. also, the peach sangria, get the pitcher, is so good... kids get pizza dough to play with. superb!!! go brian!
it was a great dining experience. i loved the food the lobster bisque is amazing and my meal itself was hearty and delicious. i also had the most interesting take on a gimlet in my life. totally recommend
tried bravo for the first time over the weekend. met some friends for a nice lunch. the outside looks amazing, a nice upgrade to the galleria mall. we had a reservation, but it didnt seem that busy for 1pm on a sunday. the waitress, daniela was very attentive. my group hadnt seen each other in a while so it took us a while to look through the menu. she was very helpful at recommending and making substitutions for our table. i ended up ordering the 5oz filet and i was pleasantly surprised by how tender it tasted. very melt in my mouth.. yum! i would definitely order it again. daniela made sure we had everything we needed and we never had to worry about refills. excellent service! hopefully, this place will pick up because it is a great addition to the restaurants in the area.
had brunch with some friends on sunday. brian c. was our server and he was excellent. he was very patient with all of us 3 kids all under the age of 6 and 5 adults. he took all the drink orders right away and even got the kids orders started immediately. everyone had great things to say about their food. i ended up ordering shrimp scampi which was very good. brian also brought out some dough for the kids to shape into anything they wanted and when they were finished he took the kids to bake the dough in the oven. he sat them down in front of the oven until done baking and then brought them back to the table. very nice touch. kids menu pizza and grilled salmon are big portions and a very good price as well.
seriously great italian food! appetizers were delicious.. great happy hour! had a ginger pineapple martini that was to die for! the manager of the restaurant was very attentive  cant help but compliment his hair! this restaurant has the best personality out of any italian restaurant i have ever enjoyed hands down! i will definitely be back!
just ate lunch here, place looks great! the food was super lightweight and delicious. i had the caprese salad, the calamari, and the chicken  pesto spaghettini. i wish the caprese salad had thinner tomatoes but overall it was delicious, the dressing they used was sweet, but not overbearing. the calamari wasnt as crunchy as i hoped it would be but i was a big fan of their sauces on the sides. the spaghettini was so good! it was absolutely perfect. i loved how much vegetables were in it, their ingredients tasted so fresh!our server was also very attentive and my overall experience in this place was very pleasant.great food, great atmosphere, and awesome customer service! im definitely coming back to check out more of their menu and their wines. :
have eaten here twice for lunch now. lovely restaurant and service. i especially liked the server rebecca. she was extremely attentive, approachable, and friendly. she also recommended a great pasta dish with sausage and red sauce i absolutely loved cant remember its name .today i had a lunch special pasta which had a light garlic sauce and chicken. for 8 it was very savory and worthwhile. the lobster bisque was also flavorful and a generous size with nice pieces of lobster in side. appropriate portions for the prices and a great selection. another thing i appreciated about bravo was the rewards program, i got a 10 welcome reward just for joining. : thank you very much!this will definitely be a hot spot for lunch, and i look forward to enjoying dinner here as well sometime.
everybody was super nice, our server bryan went above and beyond. id definitely recommend him to anyone, also our food got to us in less than ten minutes. and the food was phenomenal, great experience overall.
wow!  best service ever. their bar stools are so tall i couldnt get up on them 78 years old. lol   we wanted to do their happy hour but had to leave. when we left the server jen came after us and said you can sit on the patio and we will put the misters on. we said that would be nice. we thoroughly enjoyed happy hour and great food. the shrimp is a must try. jen and the manager came out periodicity to see how we were doing. definitely will recommend.

i usually wait for a couple of visits at the earliest before i write a review, but this place is great! great food, great service, great atmosphere. if youre trying to decide on somewhere to eat, you cant go wrong here.
i go in regularly for a drink and some appetizers. jenn is a great bartender! if your lucky enough to have her serve you, you will notice she is fast, shes sweet and she makes all her guests feel important. best service i have had in a while.

had dinner there last night and it was everything i was hoping for! cesar was our server and he was excellent!  the fried ravioli and meatballs with polenta apps were delicious.  i enjoyed the salmon and husband had the sausage with pasta. both amazing!  ended with their creme brulee cheesecake, so good!! cant wait to go back and try more yummies!
pasta fra a diavolo is great and the caprese salad. october specials are very generous. bogo pasta to go pasta of equal value, included with ordered pasta
came here tonight for our anniversary. we were seated right away, the ambiance is perfect for a relaxing date night. we were served by yul who is very cool, attentive and friendly. in fact, all the other staff checked in on us and greeted us for our anniversary which was sweet. it was such a lovely experience. food was delicious. we ordered the crispy ravioli very good and addicting for an appetizer. we also took advantage of the dinner for 2 promotion. my husband and i left happy and full. we will surely be back and will recommend bravo! to our friends and family.
went to dinner for a family members bday! the menu is such a good of variety! the atmosphere is so nice, seating outside too! defiantly will return soon, had the salmon salad one word amazing!!!!
the happy hour and food were excellent. the service was awesome. im so happy we choose to come here.i will be back.
im not yelpin yuppy like the rest of the people here that write a 500 page review on pizza and tattle tale on a restaurant, so ill just say this.great prices great food great serviceall around good family restaurant.
my first visit and it will not be my last. i was curious about what kind of restraunt  would be at a shopping mall, but was pleasantly impressed once inside. a large room with comfortable seating inside. lighting bright enough that i did not need to pull out the iphone to use the light. bar off to the side and tables outside. staff is extremely friendly and attentive. the mahi mahi came with incredible vegetables. the snap pees were crisp and sweet. the sausage sacchetti was served with incredible sweet sausage. the essence of anise was incredible. the stuffed cheese pasta blended wonderfully with the sweet sausage and red sauce. the desserts were wonderful. the ambience was wonderful. try it, you will not be disappointed.
my boyfriend and i both loved our lunch date at bravo. we both ordered delicious meals. our server bernadette made our experience at bravo very welcoming and enjoyable. thank you bernadette for your service! definitely will be back!
excellent service in the bar from bryan.  great fresh food.  i have to say, bryan did seem a bit overwhelmed at moments being the bartender, server, and patio server.  i got the chicken milanese on his suggestion.  needed a little extra sauce.  i cant wait to go back.
we had our rehearsal dinner at this bravo location and it was one of the highlights of our wedding weekend! the staff was extremely easy to work with, starting with the reservation all the way through the service at the event. picking the menu was very simple and easy, and the printed menu was cool to have for our guests and made dinner selections very easy. we had their large private room to ourselves, which was really special. they let us come by a few times before the event to scope it out. and we also had access early in that day to drop off things like giftscake so we didnt have to bring them with us that night. we were able to control the music and the air for our own room. and we could even closeopen the curtains to make it more private or not. our party was for about 24 people, and when we first sat down, the tables were a little crowded. they brought us extra tables and set them up without even disturbing the dinner. the service was 5 stars throughout, they even cut up and served a cake we brought ourselves. our guests kept talking about how delicious the food was, too. really special, and a great way to kick off our wedding weekend!
excellent food, service, and prices.  the three of us were very satisfied.  walking in we were immediately seating by friendly hostess.  waiter was attentive and aware if anything was needed.  waiter brought us refills before we asked for them; a sign of a great waiter.  food was very good with good portions and the prices were very reasonable.
i am floored at the prices on their menu. i will start there. when you walk in, its like you walked into one of the fancier restaurants in the area. yet, their pricing is so amazing. service was impeccable. they were more than willing to move me seats when i asked we were seated near the door to the patio seating  i get cold very easily. completely professional wait staff  floor staff at all times. our waitress, i believe her name was rebecca short blonde curly hair, made amazing recommendations. i had the chicken marsala sp? since they didnt have chicken parm on their menu for the day. it was only 14  honestly big enough to feed 2 people. my daughter got the kids chicken parm, which was only 5  as big as an adult plate. i am so baffled at the ambience, the pricing, the food quality,  the serving sizes. this place does not cut any corners. i highly recommend going  i am not upset with myself for not trying this place sooner. thank you bravo for this amazing lunch! you earned yourself a new repeat patron today!
i have been to bravo 4 times since i have moved to las vegas from brooklyn new york some of the best italian food you can get is in brooklyn new york so when i first came to vegas and went to bravo i was totally taken back not only by the food but by the service i have been there with friends and cousins from new jersey they have all raised about the service and the food it is now my favorite italian restaurant in las vegas
are you kidding me!!!?? the best food ever! i dont even write reviews but i had to stop midway thru my meal to do it! this is too yummy for the price. the atmosphere... the service.. five stars hands down! wish i lived closer or there was another bravo by my house.
i did not expect this place to be so good.  its just outside the mall, but is excellent!  the food was great, service was great, and atmosphere was very nice.  ill be back for sure!
my sister and i ate here for dinner and left with nothing but a five star experience from the food to the service. we started with a caprese salad which was very good!! i enjoyed a pork chop that was cooked to perfection with a side of delicious veggies and amazing mash potatoes. my two year old had the grilled chicken with veggies and the freshest fruit ever off the kids menu. i also ordered lasagna to go for the hubby which he thought was absolutely delicious as well. cant wait to bring the family back!!!
i have to say this is one of the top 3 happy hours in vegas henderson. great bar menu, great pub grub great place for a first date. very friendly wait staff and yule your a real pro. thx.
amazing service and delicious food!the food here was so good!!we also had a fantastic server!thank you jennifer for being so efficient and attentive!
i will see this show again, she has an amazing voice! i grew up watching her shows and i never knew she could entertain like this. she is the full package, a perfect vegas show for the family.
love love love it! i loved the show, she has a great voice. the showroom is small but makes for a very intimate show. the screens above the stage were a nice touch. sitting at the front area of the balcony the screens made the venue look larger. i cant wait to see it again.
i was pleasantly surprised as a friend invited me a long and i did not expect much. the smaller showroom was actually a plus for me as we were close to the stage and felt more a part of the show. suzanne has an amazing voice which i had not realized before watching the show and she looks amazing still. i will be back soon with my family!
when i heard that suzanne somers was going to open her show at westgate i thought, who in their right mind would start a residency in las vegas, of all places, at 68? and why?? granted, she was just on dancing with the stars and she has written a couple of huge best sellers and she is a regular guest on the oreilly factor; love bill, but can she carry a whole show? the answer is yes. she can!her show was very entertaining and reminiscent of old vegas meaning, very little props, real musicians and a microphone in the on position. not very common in our city these days. she connected with the audience by sharing nuances of her life and career. brought back so many memories of her tv shows and uso tours because i was living in germany at the time and that was a base stop on the way to destinations unknown. she sang mostly standards taken from the great american songbook. some i knew, some i didnt. but that didnt really matter. her voice was clear and her presence ethereal. plus its hard to miss those legs! her band consisted of just 5 members but the sound was full and they were excellent! i especially liked the sax player who occasionally was spotlighted. i have an affinity to the sound of a saxophone as my father played sax in the army band and i grew up listening to him practice and play.suzanne never skipped a beat even changing, effortlessly i might add, on stage. she looked great, i loved the last gown, and i could tell she was at home and in her element.the only grumble i have is there were no photo ops after the show, otherwise, if you want to see a real las vegas show with a very talented star and cast, see suzanne sizzles. you heard me!
my husband and i saw suzanne sizzles at the westgate last night. we loved it!  suzanne somers is really entertaining. she has a great voice, wonderful stories, and shes just so likable and downtoearth. it was so nice to see an entertainer who wasnt  just going through the motions she loved being on that stage, and it showed. it had a cabaret feel to the show, and the musicians were great. the theater is intimate meaning theres not a bad seat in it, with a nice bar in back. we were thoroughly entertained, and would definitely go see her again.
another reason to love suzanne somers!we loved her as the mystery blond in american graffiti. we loved her as the ditsy blond in threes company. now we can fall in love with the beautiful voice and warm personality that is suzanne somers at the westgate.youll be tempted to argue that shes lipsyncing. shes that sweet and consistently strong. watch closely, its really her singing live and lovely. whod have thought it? she especially hit the mark with leon russells a song for you. wonderful rendition.three costume changes and she never leaves the stage! from the moment she makes her entrance to the end of the show, suzanne somers is in charge. she generously and warmly shares the stage with her band especially the incredible sax player and a very lucky audience member. but there is no doubt that it is her show.and the production itself is worthy of her performance. the sound engineering is top notch. cant say enough about the lighting. perfectly set the mood for each number yet never upstaged them.the quality of this production is comparable no, better than!  many of the high budget shows elsewhere in town. supurb!thank you suzanne for coming back to the stage. we missed you and didnt even know it!
the wife wanted me to put the following review for this show. super sultry, beautiful set, seamless costume changes right on stage, gorgeous woman with a voice to match ! her stories of frank sinatra  the rat pack, american graffiti, barry manilow and her many uso shows for the troops were captivating. great show and a great evening out !!
theres a reason everyone has given 5 stars so far  suzanne delivers.  i went because i wanted to see a celebrity and had zero expectations other than to hear a few classic tunes, hoping suzanne would be a passable singer.  well, it turns out that shes not only a passable singer, but a true entertainer in the classic vegas fashion.  you can tell she put her all into this show, and isnt relying on her mere celebrity to carry it.  her vocals were surprisingly strong i was expecting to hear chrissy singing!, pitch perfect, and her acting background ensured great phrasing and delivery  she sold every song.  the songs were all woven into many interesting stories and anecdotes around her career and her famous friends, as were her several onstage costume changes.  the best part  you could hearunderstand the lyrics  the wonderful band didnt overpower her vocals so common these days.  suzanne got up close and personal with the audience  lots of interaction  and was humble in that she expressed her sincere gratitude to the audience for attending. i noticed the legendary steve lawrence in the audience who lost his equally legendary wife eydie gorme a couple of years ago, and suzanne paid an emotional homage to him and dedicated one of eydies songs to him  shes a real class act.  one other thing  this lady is in fantastic shape at age 68, or any age for that matter. i guess the thighmaster must really work!
we had a great time here! the food was excellent as was the service and atmosphere. our waitress sheena was the best and even staff not waiting on us asked how we liked everything and made sure we were happy. the whole staff is amazing attentive. i cant wait to go back again and again!
opening night for this restaurant and they are doing great.  bacon cheddar tater tots were great, a must have.  thanks josh and vanessa!  well be regulars here.
first visit to public school. i was eagerly awaiting the opening. just ordered an ice tea and the shaved brussel sprout salad for a light bite. salad was loaded with blue cheese, super yummy. highly recommend. ill be back for more!
we have a winner! summerlin residents, we have tried every new restaurant in downtown summerlin several times. right out of the gate, this was very good. beer selection is amazing, i had the best beer in my life, thai chili, best apps and an amazing chicken and waffle entree. excellent layout, tons of outdoor seating and on the east side of the building, smart play.
went to opening night and was extremely pleased. food was amazing, service on the mark and drinks over the top. decided to return this evening for happy hour. the waitress brittney was very attentive and informative regarding the food and menu items. we were given water immediately and the drinks came within a reasonable time. the atmosphere is relaxed with class. prices reasonable. we will definitely plan on coming back. i compliment the staff for the organization and positive atmosphere while opening a new restaurant, they seem to have worked many of the bugs early! by the way try the crushed velvet and the lavender vanilla  they are fantastic drinks.
im very impressed with this place just opening up! husband and i were seated immediately and our waitress, christina, came over shortly after. she was wonderful, right away she told us all about the place and pointed out some of her favorite options, which im always pleased with when its not just the most expensive. also, i liked that they have about 6 dishes that can be made vegetarian by request. we started with the buffalo cauliflower, her suggestion, which was amazing and i am not a fan on cauliflower. its served with a blue cheese aioli and franks red hot sauce on the side. it was a large portion for the two of us and i would get it again! also, we got the ahi tuna wonton tacos. they were good. not amazing but good. i dont think i would get them again though since the cauliflower left such a big impression. for dinner i got shrimp and grits with a beerblanc sauce. it was perfect!!!! i would order this again. the shrimp are cut in half so it looks like you are getting more than what you think you are. i didnt mind this because i like cutting the shrimp in smaller pieces so that i get some in every bite. the lady sitting next to me ordered this and she recommended it but said it was a bit to spicy for her. i enjoyed the bit of heat the dish had and didnt feel that it was all the spicy. i enjoyed just smashing and mixing everything together so that i would get a little of everything in every bite. the portion was large enough for me to take some for lunch tomorrow too which i liked. husband got fried jidori chicken  green chili  cornbread waffles that had a bacon red eye gravy on the side. he ate it faster than ive ever seen him eat before! he loved it, he said the waffle was a nice savory accompaniment to the fried jidori chicken. i was able to sneak a bite the chicken was the most juiciest and moist chicken that ive had in a long time it was very delicious. it was the best tasting chicken ive had in a long time it was creamy yet firm, and had the best chicken flavor ive ever had! the atmosphere was very hip with all types of decorations from a classroom. the ceiling over the bar looked like a gymnasium floor, they have beer pong, jenga, table shuffle board, and darts. the patio is beautiful, reminds you of a nice back yard with cool seating options. each cabana like table has their own personal fan for the summer and heater for when its cooler. they have a variety of seating options anywhere from two toppers to larger parties which i liked because it seems like you wouldnt have to wait as long for tables to get pushed together for parties of 6 or more and they had round tables for larger parties which i like.  this will definitely be our new go to. i cant wait to try the rest of the menu, everything looked scrumptious.
all i can say is wow!!! awesome food. great service. the beer selection and variety is sweet!! delicious food. dont pass this place up. unique food with unbelievable flavors. it will definitely be on your favorites list.
great first experience.  happy hour has great food and drinks!  try the fried cauliflower!
faro salad, and the chili wgreen chili cornbread, paired with the uinta 22nd anniversary sourbeer.  tasty, tasty, the cornbread is awesome!  vanessa, my server, was very attentive and knowledgable.
i went late wednesday night with some friends, we had ryan as our bartender and he was amazing! made excellent drinks and was very attentive. we also ordered some food after partaking in a few shots. we ordered the deviled eggs, pepperoni pizza, and the fig pizza. the food was okay, nothing special but it did the job. i will be back very soon, maybe not to eat but definitely to drink. the whole place looked amazing and was decorated very cool.
great place. bacon cheddar tots are great. tuna tacos, watermelontomatoes salad were light and also delicious. i had the shrimp and grits and the best thing ive tasted in a while.
this place is literally too cool for school!!!finally, dt summerlin offers a place where couples can go on double dates, single people can meet someone cool at the bar, families can bring their kids, and birthdays can be celebrated... adult style! talk about a onestopshop for whatever! the atmosphere is nostalgically collegiate in every way. even the smallest of details have been addressed. you definitely cant compare it to any other restaurant or bar youve eaten at. its in a class of its own!pun intended
what a cool place. we just had drinks, but a great selection of craft beers on tap.  the second story patio is great on a nice day overcast day not a ton of shade.  the food looked incredible.
went for brunch, amazing again! amanda from portland was the best. happy hour tomorrow. ..be there!!!
the service was amazing katie and brittany were incredible!!! ryan at the bar was great too! the food is amazing! nothing is frozen, everything is fresh. these girls were funny and so friendly i will most definitely be back! beer pong and shuffle board available.
my new favorite restaurant in las vegas. ive lived here 5 months and have eaten at several restaurants around town, this one is easily in my top 5.  great service, food and ambiance. get a gin and tonic with their housemade gin, and the buffalo cauliflower.  yowza.  ill be back sooner than later!
love this new and much needed addition to dt summerlin.  we have visited 3xs in a week.  food is excellent, craft beer menu very cool, and a skilled bar tender shakes a good martini.  but all i ask is that you turn down the tunes.  what is the point of music so loud you leave diners  bar visitors screaming at each other.  if i leave w a headache i wont remember how good the food is.
i have absolutely nothing negative to say about this place. we came here having found it while browsing on yelp. we checked out the menu and decided to give it a try. first of all, the interior is so neat. i love the play on the school theme. we made in time for happy hour 3:306:30. our food was amazing. we had: farro and brussels sprout salad, crispy ahi tuna tacos, 2 carafes of the house white, the bbq bison burger with fries, bbq mustard, and sriracha ketchup, deviled eggs, and the nutella cookie sandwich. all of which was amazing and reasonably priced. we will be back again for sure. our server was christina and she was awesome!! she took great care of us as did the other ladies who helped out.
wow!  i was blown away by this place. there are several good eating choices in downtown summerlin and im glad i chose this place. the drinks were original and tasty. there were so many food selections that i want to try that ill definitely be back. i recommend public school 702!
simply put, this place rocks.  i went to dinner here last night for some surprise birthday action and was really impressed.  the servers let us slowplay dinner by leaving space between drinks, appys, and entrees.  i didnt have any appetizers but i did see the faces of those that did...and they were very happy ones. : a few of the apes they ordered were: buffalo cauliflower like hot wings, but fried cauliflower instead and deviled eggs looked awesome.between the 13 of us, everyone tried lots of different food  i had the farro  brussel salad with seared scallops and it was incredible!  the flavor profile was unique with a sweet curry dressing and the scallops were cooked very well.  i feel like its so easy to screw scallops up, and they did such a good job!  the bison burger looked fantastic and the mac and cheese looked even better.  oh  and the beer menu is legit!  plus...can we discuss this amazing thing that happened at 9pm?  a crazy buzzer went off and for the next 15 minutes, all the draft beers were just a dollar.  15 minutes later, the buzzer went off again, and they went up to 2. they do this every 15 minutes til 10pm. also  one of the servers, jamie f, was freaking awesome.  i asked her to help me choose what to order and she was super thorough and went through the handful of dishes i had questions about.  plus, i ended up getting what i really wanted.  she even stopped by to make sure i liked it afterward.  she really made the experience that much better for us!i will definitely be back!
the service is amazing, mac  cheese melted in your mouth. if your looking for a great friendly environment to bring your family for lunch this is the spot to be in downtown summerlin.
another welcome addition to downtown summerlin, recently opened a couple of weeks ago, they sure got it together pretty quick. it is a huge restaurant and has a very large outdoor area with booths and even ceiling fans as well as beer pong, it appeared. i didnt go outside because it is an oven here in vegas. i was shocked that people sit outside and eat, there were like 5 tables of people when i went sitting outside. go for it, if that is your thing. we sat in the bar area which i felt was pretty spacious but it filled up quick. my friends arrived at 3:30 when it first started and said a couple tables were available. when i arrived around 4, the place was filling up quick. i think we left around 5:30 and i saw a wait, about 610 people outside. if possible, i suggest coming early to reserve a spot for happy hour recess. this restaurant is really cute on the details without going overboard on the school theme, but if you look close you will see flashcards above the bar and all kinds of little fun cool details everywhere. i am a teacher, so i dont need to be reminded of school please, but for me the decorations were cool not annoying or cheesy. we ordered:crispy cauliflowerserved with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese  sooo good!farro and brussel sprouts saladdelicious!!dip duo not so great, the bread was not crispy nor soft, it seemed old and had a strange feeling to it, dips were just ok, nothing special speck  eggs i enjoyed this. it was salty but good. crispy naked wings i am not a big fan of wings, but these were really good. crispy ahi tuna tacosi enjoyed these too!parmesan truffle fries i have to say i have been unable to find a place that does truffle fries just how i want it. to me, these were just right! loved the lemon aioli dipping sauce on the sidemy hubby had beers and he did not complain. i wish they had some girly cocktails on their happy hour menu, not just well drinks. that is kind of boring. service was good, plenty of workers everywhere, and i am happy we have a new good restaurant to go to, especially with such a good happy hour.
we are on a satisfying flavor overload! from the appetizer to the dessert, we couldnt ask for a better experience to celebrate our anniversary. just look at the pictures, and imagine the scrumptiousness that follows when you try this place! and despite what the reviews say, we were lucky to have such a knowledgable server...ask for amanda!!!
came here for the opening day and again a week later. everything was delicious. food came out quick and the servers were very friendly! cocktails and beer were exceptional. loved the atmosphere and the interior design. many people here are complaining about slow service and im not sure why. public school is a band new restaurant they are still settling in so its expected to have a hick up here and there. will definitely be back!
my teacher friends and i have the chance to be students at ps702 on friday, june 19th. i can truly say i have never had more fun, good food and great atmosphere in my life. there were 10 of us total and we tried everything on the menu, food and drinks. we played some other the games and just soaked the place in. it was fantastic. we had so much fun we will be having are july birthday celebration there.
public school 702... first time here amazing! it has only been open a few weeks, so happy we stumbled upon this place. downtown summerlin is lucky to have this place. our server was extremely helpful and seemed to really know the menu. we had a few sample beers prior to deciding on our favs. we were recommended to try the buffalo cauliflower, the truffle steak salad and the bison burger. all of which were very flavorful. our server was selina she has incredibly sweet and very helpful. the decor inside is decorated just like a school setting, nice touch. its the little details that make customers want to come back for the experience.
this place is awesoooooooooooome!!!! cool vibe, nice interior, lovely outdoor patio. came here on a wednesday night with some girls, and a dj was playing some awesome 90s hip hop, alternating with some karaoke action. bacon and cheddar tater tots 45. everyone loved it but i thought it was good. summer succotash 45. good stuff but not to die for. first time eating succotash and apparently it doesnt get any better than this. deviled eggs35. good but nothing special. truffle fries 45 good but ive had better. mezza plate 35.  the waiter recommended this. i didnt think the hummus and anything else was that great except for the fried garbanzo bean that was crunchy on the outside. shrimp and grits 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!! great sauce flavor, shrimp was perfectly cooked, and the grits patty that looks like a hash brown was absolutely delicious. id come back for this dish hands down. phenomenal selection of beers available here. one extra star for carrying my fave beer...greenflash ipa. service was excellent. its slow because it was busy, but our waiter jared was super helpful, friendly, and made sure we were taken care of though keep in mind service is generally slow and our food took a while to arrive. kyle, the gm came by to say hello and he was super nice as well. i like the ambiance of this place, and the dj who played awesome music really made the night for me. met a lot of cool locals. id definitely come back to try the jidori fried chicken as well as their burgers. kudos to jared for putting up with us ladies on our girls night out! ;
this place was awesome.  really loved the atmosphere its very fun and the food amazing. bison burger, lamb burger. and adobo tacos.    and desert was amazing
best restaurant in summerlin! possibly my favorite in vegas. cant say if i like the food, the beer or the service best. all are top notch. the beer list is full of unique treats you can not find anywhere else. if you are a beer fan this is your home. have been here a couple times and have yet to have something on the food menu i would not rave about. the guy who waited on us the first time has made it a point to stop by and say hey each time we have been back in. dont get that often in vegas. definitely worth checking out!!!
the service and the food was amazing! the recommendations were perfect! the tots were fantastic and all the crushed velvet was so good! i ordered the bison burger and it was cooked to perfection! what my favorite part of this dinner was the spectacular service we received! everyone was great and the atmosphere is pretty cool too! definitely coming back!
place is legit great beer selection friendly staff and a nice party scene highly recommend. o ya this cool ass doctor bought shots for the whole bar!
food was excellent. we had the fried chicken and waffles. the bison burger and the adobo tacos. would order all three again. we finished off with lemon dessert. so good. service was prompt without being overbearing. comfortable atmosphere without being stuffy. would consider bringing my kids next time around. will be back.
the decor and ambiance of the restaurant was excellent, inviting and a place to relax.  the food selection doesnt seem like there are many options, but as you read through the menu there are actually quite a few.  had the bison burger with the kale  brussels slaw.  the quality of the food combined with the taste was superb!  pricing is very reasonable and not over priced.  service and friendliness of staff was great!
came for brunch for our first time here and had an absolutely amazing experience!! 10 all you can drink brunch cocktails and beer is the best deal in town and the food was equally as good. had the watermelon and tomato salad which was delicious and refreshing and also the white bean breakfast toast which was amazing!!! our server sean was great and brought me my next drink without even asking for it. overall an exceptional experience and i cant wait to come back. my boyfriend was also super impressed with their eclectic beer menu.
josh was great.  came with 3 friends and we order apps and entrees to share.  great food, great atmosphere and great service.  we will definitely be back.  considering the 4 of us have a f and b background, they hit the mark here.  cauliflower, bacon and cheese tots, chorizo mac, and the burger all worth mentioning.
fried cauliflower is awesome need to have the ahi tuna tacos every time i come. fig and prosciutto pizza is amazing. the beer menu is pretty good, the rotating drafts are even better. try a new beer that youve never had, dont stick with the same old cap. expand your horizons! dont order coors, bud, miller, shock top, or blue moon here, try their other beers! you might find something you like!
pretty excited to discover this cali gastropub was arriving at the swanky downtown summerlin. great beers and our server was not only fun but extremely knowledgeable and turned me on to the whimsical and tasty golden monkey. outdoor patio is great place for a late night meal. and best of al locals get half off their bill on mondays. how good is that?
lunch was amazing.  excellent choice of options, perfect portions, great draft beers with rotational selections, highly recommended this place!
what an awesome place!  great food, great service!  we made a reservation, and were glad we did!got there just in time for the tail end of recess aka happy hour.  decent variety of drink and appetizer specials, with enough that should cover everyones tastes.  bartenders were very knowledgeable and very friendly, even though it was packed.dinner, things just got better, we tried the fried coliflour, as has been reviewed here many times.  it was really good, but what outdid it was the bacon cheddar tater tots.  yum!  for my main, i had bangers and mash.  really good, the sausages were excellent, though not quite true to the english form of bm, but still very good.  my wife had the roasted pablano, shes not a vegetarian, but  it would have worked, and it was delicious to boot!our friend had the short rib, which he reported was out of this world good.  his wife had the shrimp and white cheddar grits.  best grits ive ever tried.just wish there was more than 5 stars to really make this place stand out even more.  we will be back for sure!!
the menu is fresh with a great selection of beers and a rotating list on tap, the food is good and the decor is fun and unique but what stood out the most was the customer service. we had two beers and two appetizers and one beer was a little late and so was one appetizer 30 min late. we didnt complain but when our server realized what had happened she immediately sent the manager over who came to make sure we were having an ok time. and then he comped our entire bill and even asked our server to offer us free dessert. we declined and were impressed at the efforts they made to make the situation right. this is a place you wont be dissatisfied with.
check out this spot! from the service, theme, food, drinks and culture this is a must visit. we arrived and were told it was going to be about 30 min but were sat in about 15. the hostess was friendly and even though she was talking to someone she was able to still look at us, smile and let us know she would be with us in a minute. simple acknowledgement goes a very long way!the menus were like black notebooks which immediately caught my eye and the beer list was typed on notebook paper. very original.started with a vanilla, blueberry canned beer called the big blue van and surprisingly it was really good! they specialize in a lot of crafted beers so if you like beer i recommend this spot. next we had the tuna nicoise salad and then the short ribs. the food was prompt and very good. service was 5 stars. even though we had one server many others touched out table to make sure we were ok or to check if we needed anything. i will be back for sure!side note: cool spot for group gatherings that have a oudoor patio area with its own bar and.... a beer pong table!!! lol
from the progressive and adventurous beer list to the exciting twists on comfort food, ps702 won me over within minutes of sitting down.  after sitting in a booth in their spacious bar area, we took several minutes to peruse the menu.  our server, katie, was incredibly helpful in steering us to choices for beer and appetizers.  she brought us samples of no less than 6 beers from their draft specialsi cant even remember the last time there were 6 beers on tap that i was interested in.  the decor, an eclectic mix of old school school memorabiliaincluding obsolete encyclopedias, composition notebook menus, and various sports ballsis whimsical and charming, at once evoking nostalgia and chuckles.we couldnt narrow our choices and ended up with three apps: bacon cheddar tots, fiery calamari, and chorizo mac  cheese.  the tots won immediate approval from dh, with him declaring i must get my own order.  indeed, they were creamy, salty, bombs of delicious, only made better with the justtherightamountofheat sriracha ketchup.  mac  cheese had huge chunks of chorizo and a smattering of kale, just enough so you can pretend its healthy.  the al dente campanelle smothered in an emmental and cheddar sauce really held the sauce and sausage well, even if it was a tad difficult to serve with the undersized spoon provided.  the calamari, dusted with japanese togorashi pepper blend and served with a light, but potent, ginger aioli wasnt a revelation, but it was a cut above the standard and would be a good choice for a group. just be sure to ask for extra of the outstanding aioli.  after overindulging on appetizers, we split the lamb burger.  melted brie and tomato cranberry jam made just the right complement of tangy, sour, and umami to the perfectly cooked lamb patty.  the burger belied its simple appearance, rivaling more complicated offerings from other notable valley restaurants.  the accompanying kale and shaved brussels sprout slaw wasnt just a throwaway either.  creamy, bitter, and pungent with red onion and blue cheese, it still qualified as comfort food while providing a much needed veg on the plate.  dessert was a ginormous version of the ubiquitously trendy ice cream sandwich, but the additions of nutella and bacon brittle made it too, a standout.service was excellent too, with food served up quickly from the knowledgeable staff.  katie in particular went above and beyond for us more than once.  i highly recommend requesting her when you visit.ps702 is open late with a dj on the spacious patio on wednesday, saturday, and industry night on monday.  they have more typical hours on the other days.  our next visit will likely be for their weekend brunch, which features a limited menu of delicious sounding breakfast items like fried jidori chicken  green chili cornbread waffles or eggs benedict pizza.  the high light though is the just about bottomless drink menu which includes mimosas, micheladas, bloody marys which im told are garnished with a chicken wing and something called a beermosa, a must try combo of oj, wheat beer, creme de peche, and lavender.there is nothing i didnt love about ps702, and i plan to be back soon and often.
such a fun place! love love love how much the theme is incorporated. vegas needed a fun spot off the strip, with great food beer that wasnt like every other restaurant. anyways! the beer selection had a nice variety! they even offered a few tasters. for apps we really enjoyed the buffalo cauliflower cheddar bacon tots. blue cheese at this place is delicious too! another starter that i really enjoyed, but my family didnt was the heirloom tomato watermelon salad. really refreshing, but different! for entrees the fig prosciutto pizza was good. loved the balsamic reduction drizzled on top, but didnt love how hard the crust was. my sister said her tacos were great, and my dad enjoyed the fish chips. for dessert we had the nutella cookie sandwich.. there was too much bacon brittle on it for all of us. we did still manage to eat the cookie ice cream parts though. overall! the service, menu, location, atmosphere will have me coming back for sure! yay.
this was one of the best meals ive had in a long time. was surprised to discover they were open at 11 on a sunday; turns out they have brunch starting at 10 with bottomlessish mimosas, micheladas, bloody marys, and other choices i already forget. he had the smothered burrito and i had the chefs stuffed blackberry lemonade french toast. the burrito was delicious with a perfect blend of flavors and the french toast...you had me at lemon curd. even the mimosas werent halfassed, with a splash of blood orange. and the prices were way more than reasonable. we will be back.
i would typically never give a 5star review, even if i was really impressed by a restaurant or server, but i strongly feel this place deserves it. being a beer lover, i was stoked about their selection of craft beers on tap. my server colby like the cheese, lol was very knowledgable about the food and drinks and sold me a dawn of the red brew that i really loved while i chowed down on ahi wanton tacosalso delicious. i would have never considered putting ahi in a crispy wonton but it was magic. despite the fact that im a beer loyalist, they had such an interesting selection of craft cocktails i had to indulge while i was finishing up my meal. colby said that the crushed velvet was very popular so i gave it a try. nice refreshing take on a moscow mule. the fresh lavender was nice touch. i cant wait to go back and work my way through their great tap selection, and ill definitely ask for colbys section because ive never had such great service at a casual concept.
went to this place yesterday its such a great place to hangout with friends. all the food i tried was delicious. everyone that worked there was really friendly, the manger tommy was super great with his customer service love this place it is definitely a place i will regularly hang out with friends. i would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
my wife and i tried this restaurant on the 4th of july, and couldnt wait to go back a couple days later. finally las vegas has a great restaurant with great craft beers in a great location! the ahi tuna tacos are a musthave, and every entree weve tried has been perfect, from the andiron steak to the fish and chips to the short rib. its not a greatly diverse menu, but that is refreshing. everything they do, they do well. and a shout out to jared, who took great care of us. im a las vegas hotel concierge so ive eaten everywhere...and this is my new favorite restaurant!
amazing service and outstanding food. plus theres games you can play, like a giant version of jenga and even beer pong! i highly recommend the chorizo mac  cheese along with the crispy cauliflower during happy hour!
i had a great dinner here the other night! it was such a cool and fun atmosphere  and the food was amazing. lots of variety and options for everyone and everything delivered well! our waiter was zoe and he was great! very nice and gave us on point recommendations since it was our first visit. he was friendly and attentive. loved it! will definitely be back and will sit in his section! great time.
its been a while since ive given a restaurant five stars.  this place is definitely worth coming back to, over and over again.  we decided to hit up their happy hour.  5 apps and well drinks. you cannot beat that.  we had everything from their wings, margarita flat bread, sliders, fried cauliflower, to ahi tacos.  nothing got left behind. we devoured it all.  im not a fan of cauliflower, in fact ive hated it since i was a kid.  my friend ordered it without me knowing.  when it came out, i grabbed one, again without knowing what it was and damn it was amazing!   once you have one, you just cannot stop.  it definitely made me want to go home and make it.  thats how great it tasted.  the wings are awesome as well.  this will definitely be our new favorite spot. cant wait to go back.
food was awesome, great beer menu that changes daily and awesome service. the vibe of the restaraunt is great with a comfy feel.
the patio is quite enjoyable with its oversized jenga game that we played. i recommend the speck and eggs, the cheddar bacon tots and the huntsman burger. like i said, everything i tasted was good!! the service was great, everyone was so friendly and the food was amazing! we ordered so many things and ate them before we could take photos! haha.  we were a large party of about twenty and the accommodated us extremely well. so well, we even returned after our movie for another drink!
i went to public school last tuesday night and i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys a great meal with excellent service. all the servers were exceptionally well but the one that stood out the most was the manager tommy. he was so energetic and i could tell he truly enjoyed his job  the company he works for. he was able to answer all my questions about all the items on the menu that i wanted to know more about. tommy knew the menu as if he wrote it himself. he was very persistent  would always come back to the table to make sure we were doing good. something most managers in other places dont do. this was the best service ive gotten in a long time. he kept a smile on his face  continued to be extremely helpful. i will be sure to come back here while also advising all my friends to go. if i could give him 10 stars i would, but i guess 5 will do :
first time visit last night  we were absolutely impressed! we joined another couple for happy hour at 4:00pm  were seated at a very large booth in the bar area the moment we arrived which was great because it was pretty busy  continued to fill up to capacity. lauren was our server  was at our table the minute the hostess left, she asked if we wanted to order drinkswater which was appreciated since the other half of our party was running late  we were ready for some refreshments. cold water arrived immediately, drinks followed within minutes which was a surprise since, again, it was pretty busy!as soon as the rest of our party arrived lauren was back to take their order, within a minute or two. she took care to answer the boys questions about the large variety of beers  made some helpful suggestions, she mentioned that she was a bartender as well, so she was really informed on the bar offerings. she returned less than 10 minutes later with the additional drinks then answered questions about the menu, again offered a few suggestions. we selected the farro salad  dip duo, both arrived within five minutes, both had great flavors and nice presentation! lauren did not hover, but did check in to see how we were doing, we sent her away with more drink and food orders...round two! we ordered 2 orders of crispy ahi tacos, crispy cauliflower, wild mushroom pizza and another order of farro salad it was that good!. again, everything came out very quickly  was perfect, each item was a very good size and did well to fill us up! we even ended up with a free order of speck  eggs due to the fact that one of the other servers mixed up her tables  had an extra, they were tasty as well!lauren checked in on us a few more times  made sure that we had everything we needed, all in all we were there over three hours and she never made us feel that we were holding up a table, she was a perfect server  we will ask to sit in her section the next time we come. we enjoyed the atmosphere and the cool designdecor and will definitely go back, cant wait for cooler weather to enjoy the patio!!!
best food and drink in summerlin! great place to sit and meet new people. the bartender, scott and the manager, tommy are very friendly and provide great service. highly recommended to all!
ahi tacos are amazing!!! nutella cookie is to die for but the best part was simon the bartender!! super friendly and funny!!
great price, atmosphere, service, food and drinks! we went here for a date night and will definitely go back again. we got a seat on the patio which i highly recommend. they have a great selection of different draft beers and upscale bar food. we enjoyed the the cutting board, ahi tacos and short rib entree. everything was on point!!!
this spot is located at downtown summerlin. quick and easy to get to. the staff is very friendly and full of answers. any of your craft beer questions they can answer for you! kortnie was my bartender. she did a fabulous job at describing different craft brewed beers and pairing them with items on the menu. she kicked ass and gave me great service. this place rocks!
picked this place for a girls night without knowing anything about it and was pleasantly surprised. the decor was really cool and it set the mood for a good evening. we chose to sit on the patio which had some fans but could use a few more it was really hot there was beer pong which surprised me but it was totally fitting. later the dj set up and played lots of great things even started karaoke at the crowds request. food:summer succotash was amazing and came highly recommended by jerrod s. our very helpful, knowledgeable and enthusiastic serveri really enjoyed the shrimp and grits the most though it was not what you expect when ordering this southern favorite. the mezze plate was a miss, i wouldnt order it again. the deviled eggs were good because i didnt have to make them myself! i especially enjoyed the crispy prosciutto on top.there were so many other things that we wanted to try but just ran out of room! i cant wait to go back and try it all!drink:amazing beer selection! i got to try a lot of new things, they had a bit of everything but i dont remember seeing any sour beers.
new favorite place in summerlin.  decor is the quintessential farm to table americana, reclaimed wood, exposed steel, etc. great atmosphere for a monday night. food was pretty good. just had appetizers.  highly recommend the tater tots with bacon and cheese on the inside. beer list is short, but quality. no wasted space with any domestics or faux micro brews ie shock top. get here before 6:30 for happy hour and a spot on the balcony.
we came here on a sunday evening for dinner. we were seated right away on their awesome patio. there is a great selection of beers and i love the school theme! the food was amazing and they have a lot of interesting options. we got the bison burger with quinoa salad, bangers and mash and the ice cream sandwich with bacon for dessert. our waiter, zo, was especially helpful and offered a lot of advice on what we would like. he definitely sold us on the dessert and it was well worth it. we cant wait to come back!!
first time we visited ps 702 and can happily say we had a great lunch and experience. we each had a beer and shared a cutting board chucarterie. we loved it. the meat and cheeses with the olive oil bread was excellent. we also shared the 4 mini tuna tacos appetizer. the atmosphere is awesome and we will sit outside next time. our server lauren was friendly, knowledgeable and efficienta sweetheart. the general manager bought a beer for us. 5 stars all around and we will be back with guests and try some of the main entree items. kudos to all.
the decision to eat here is the best las vegas decision ive ever made. our server, sister katie was knowledgable on every item and wasnt afraid to make recommendations based on what we were looking for. just like a real sister, except we are not even related. lauren also stopped at our table to make some drink recommendations and helped us decide which dessert to choose ask her how they apply the nutella....its a treat. ill be back with friends for sure. oh and try the steak with the mac and cheese.
in found the spot in yelp it fulfilled my every expectation and beyond! the menu is here is creative and full of flavor! i loved the decor and concept of the restaurant service was ok. in my opinion patio seating is the best way to go its has beer pong and a large jenga game its probably best you make a reservation. when we arrived we were told a 1hr wait but it actually turned out ti be about less than 15mins. we ordered fried calamari, specks and eggs, banger and mash, skillet steak w chorizo mac n cheese, lemon meringue beware very tart!!!!, and crushed velvet drinksthe only thing i didnt like, its pretty but way to much ginger. over all this has become a top 5 casual place to eat in vegas for me
great food!!!!! the only thing, they dont filter their water. how hard is it to get reverse osmosis so that i dont have to bring my own water? hopefully...
omg they introduced a new entree to the brunch menu. pecan crusted french toast it is indescribable. not to sweet, but the grilled peach with a sweet cheese is amazing to finish the plate. i love how the chefs use their creative  imagination and in depth palate to make such a dish. two thumbs up!! i am looking forward to the winter menu. matt was our waiter and he made the brunch a blast. he was attentive, on the ball with everything we needed. he really enjoys his job and his new home in las vegas.
great food. the wait can get long. so suggest going on weird times. ordered the pizza twice. one to take home. vanessa is great!!!!
my husband  i decided to check out this somewhat newer restaurant at downtown summerlin tonight. we were given the option of sitting inside or outside  decided that since the seating was in the shade wed take outside. the table arrangements are lovely with fans blowing the air so it didnt feel so warm it is vegas in july you know! there were a lot of tables but not so many that you felt you were sitting on your neighbor. i must add that the inside was decorated really neat! there were quite a few colored, lighted globes hanging from the ceiling which we loved! it did seem awfully loud inside with voices so im really glad we chose outside! we were immediately greeted by grace who offered recommendations of their cocktails  wines. im impressed that she knew both so well. i ended up getting the chardonnay that she recommended unfortunately i cannot remember the winery but it was the higher priced of the 2  it was perfect! i love a chardonnay with butter under tones  this one had it! my husband got the crushed velvet which was incredibly delicious! she also gave a couple appetizer recommendations  we order the meat  cheese platter which was truly devine! the prosciutto was thinly sliced  not at all fatty  the salami was yummy! the cheeses  couple of condiments were great compliments to the meat. i especially liked that the toast was thinly sliced  toasted making it easy to bite into. we had a second server, vanessa, assist us who was equally knowledgeable  attentive. i must say that it is wonderful to have servers who have actually tried the food  drinks  can give you their opinion. my husband ordered the short ribs  i the shrimp with cheddar cheese grits. both were highly recommended by both servers  they did not disappoint! my shrimp dish was full of shrimp  vegetables as well as flavor! i ended up ordering a glass of the granache. while it was a very delicious wine, i would go with one with a bit more kick next time as this dish was full of flavor,  not what i was expecting. my husband thoroughly enjoyed his short ribs  said the mashed potatoes were really good with a hint of horseradish  small pieces of potato in it.we had just enough attention by vanessa throughout our meal but not too much that we felt rushed. we will definitely return to try something new! and to think that initially i wasnt so excited about the menu. boy, my mind was changed!
so i asked for a stoli tonic. she looks at me with this weird puss and tells me no stoli, and that the tonic is brown. its like an old school bar  no soda guns, juices are squeezed from scratch, and the cokes mexican. five stars right there for effort. i ordered the margherita pizza. not sure why, i suppose the woman next to me had one that looked amazing. fresh basil, tomato,  yummy sauce and crust. well done. we had such an ass next to us who changed his order, ordered a lamburger rare, then sent it back because it was rare... i almost kicked his ass for being a jerkoff, but jail aint worth it. the decor is amazing. school references everywhere. drinks are amazing. service was fast and friendly. well definitely be back.
josh in the guinness hat circa 2009 was ok...but the cauliflower was decent. wish they had ranch, josh suggested we go to wolfgang puck instead
love this place after 2 brunch visits. i wonder if their dinner is bad since, honestly, brunch is so good here. ambiance: 55 casual, trendy, with a fun, public school theme. space is large, which is nice since they were able to easily accommodate our huge 10ppl group on short notice. service: 45 friendly, but can get a bit slow at times.food: chorizo mac  cheese: 55 so good. creamy, savory, yummy, goodness. scrape the bottom of the plate goodness. also excellent value. id just get this as  meal.bacon tater tots: 55 also very yummy. crispy on the out side buttery flaky on the inside. so good.speck  eggs: 35 good but not out of the ordinary.fried jidori chicken and green chili cornbread waffles: 55 delicious chicken, perfectly seasoned, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. waffle was maybe not the typical texture but you have to remember its cornbread. still very good. also, huge portion.stuffed french toast: 55 very good. sweet but not overly sweet.shrimp and grits: 55 perhaps the best shrimp and grits ive ever had. the grits didnt come in a bowl of mush, but rather in something like a grit cakea little crunch on the outside and creamy on the inside. almost bottomless mimosa: 25 its fine but mimosa is a mimosa. nothing special. and definitely loses out to the bloody mary.almost bottomless bloody mary: 105 omg. it came with a pickled garlic and a...chicken wing. no joke. solid spicy kick, and not too sweet. i swear next time im just coming to get bottomless bloody mary. thats 4 bloody marys and 4 chicken wings. for 10. what more can you ask for in a brunch? amazeballs.
this place just opened a few months ago and i love it here!  they have really good food, especially for bar food and the night life is awesome too.  i totally would check this place out for dinner and drinks or just late night drinks!
vanessa was super sweet and down to earth. she made alot of great suggestions and even danced a lil bit with us with the live dj.  we ll def be back!!!!
just had the best dinner,  vanessa v was the best.  she made great recommendations, had a trainee and still didnt miss a beat.
brussel sprouts and farro salad with scallops was on point. the lemon meringue was outstanding like ill probably have dreams about it.  i loved my crushed velvet cocktail.  overall a bomb outdoor patio. fantastic service.  cool vibe. ill definitely be returning.
best spot to eat, hang, relax and enjoy in summerlin. that server sheena is awesome and definitely easy on the eyes.
service and food was great! the best part was our server jared smith who made jokes and made us laugh. only issue was that management could not find a table for party of 10 for happy hour so that was disappointing. jared made it fun and made some ok jokes but it was funny after a few drinks! i will def come back here with co workers after a friday nigh. i wish they had ranch dressing but it was a great experience after a hard week of work. wish i had more  to leave a better tip. thank you jared for making my first encounter with ps702 a great one. we will def come back here again. p.s. kudos for the chef.
i had the summer succotash and added chicken.. it was so amazing!! i wanted to order another to take home. great recommendation by my server, jared smith. my diet is very restricted and he was extremely knowledgable about the ingredients in the dishes. im also not a big beer drinker but he was able to help me find one i loved. great food with even better service. i live on the other side of town but will definitely be returning!!
first off the location is so convenient.  the decor and theme is unique and just fun. our waitress was informative friendly and made great recommendations. now on to the food part..... the food was amazing!!! we had the cheese and meat tray. im generally pretty picky! i ate everything on that tray and loved it. the chicken and waffles is an unique spin but absolutely delicious. the ahi tuna tacos another tasty treat.  other reviews mentioned 5 drinks. we had 10 near bottomless drinks4 each!!!
i love this place! its exactly what summerlin needed. the ambiance is awesome inside with an equally awesome patio. the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the manager nick even made it a point to stop by our table and ask how things were which really stood out to me. everything i have tried here is fantastic! full of flavor, great prices, wonderful cold beer on draft and the cocktails are delicious. there is one thing that may be a never ending craving for me though and that is the bacon cheddar tots. if i could change my facebook status to married to the bacon cheddar tots at public school 702 i would do it immediately with pride. do yourself a favor and make this your new spot.
i dont know how i havent written a review for this place, yet. i certainly thought i had.ive been here twice now; once with the husband, once with a girlfriend for happy hour.my husband and i are calamari lovers. there is this calamari in georgetown in washington dc that is so good that it is the bar in which we judge all others. public schools calamari is even better than that. it is the calamari to compare all others. perfectly tender, perfectly battered, and complimented with this ginger aioli, it is impeccable.ive had a burger, ahi tacos from the happy hour menu, and bangers and mash. they are all awesome. the best part of the entire meal, besides the calamari, is the slaw that you can substitute instead of fries. it is lemony, crispy, crunchy, and fresh. i would have licked my plate if not in public.go eat here. you wont be disappointed.
christina s took very good care of us. we ordered all the items she highly recommended and they were amazing. the food and that guavalajara drink were just heavenly! great food great vibe! thank you very much!!
food was on point. seriously awesome concept and menu selection. place is beautiful. liquor selection is smaller than i anticipated. great staff and attentive service. went on a monday or tuesday? around 910pm. so it was slow. and i enjoy that pace. i imagine the madness on a weekend, and for that reason i will revisit on a weeknight.
came here last minute date night with wife.  it has a cool casual vibe.  our wait staff was very attentive and gave prompt service.  we had fiery calamari and ahi tacos.  the tacos had sweet bitter contrast which were nice.  calamari was not spicy but had a good taste and crispy.  they had wide selection of beers.  my hawaiian beer was refreshing.  over all, it is a perfect place to chill with a love one.  call ahead for a seat outside over looking the fountains.
this place is seriously legitimate.4 craft beers!shuffleboard!outside patio with beer pongshrimp and grits that you will die overcool atmosphere!downtown summerlin!this place has it all!
valerie made our night the best night ever as our server. very out going and most personable server ive had. food was great and the draughts were on point
great beer. great wings. great happy hour specials. service was slow for a bit but thats fine, it was not bad enough to knock a star off
great atmosphere, fantastic food. server vanessa was not only knowledgeable, fun, and attentive, but super cute as well.  will definitely be back!
the food here is absolutely amazing. we had my birthday planned for a different place, but immediately switched to public school after eating here once. the food is out of this world, and the beer selection is amazing. i recommend the jidori chicken with jalapeno cornbread waffles. make sure to ask for vanessa as your server. she walked me through the extensive beer menu and even provided me with samples of her recommendations. best service ive had ina  long time.
awesome concept and food here! valerie was a great server unlike other restaurants in downtown summerlin!
food and beer was amazing, but the service here was phenomenal thanks to our waitress valerie!!!!! definitely recommending this place to friends!!!!
colby was great. he was attentive and made sure we were happy! he is the only reason for this 5 star. the chicken and waffles won at our table. the lamb burger was good not great. and the steak with mushroom salad, our mid rare steak was cooked properly but the arugula didnt do the plate justice  also the portion of greens was off for the price.
if you havent tried this place you are seriously missing out. the patio is a must and everything on the menu is amazing. a completely cool experience. and if you can land vanessa as a server you are in for a a great education in the beers they offer both on special and the regular menu. she rocks!
cant say enough good things about public school 702. this is my third time here and everything has been great. fried chicken and waffles with the green chile cornbread waffles are so good. ahi tuna taco app was also really, really good. brittany is a very attentive waitress and lots of fun. she is smart and very knowledgable about the menu. trust her advice. this is one of the best places in vegas.
excellent seared scallop brussels salad and salmon plate.  also the tuna taco appetizer was delicious.  we sat out on the patio and the ambience was very relaxing.  awesome place.
i have been schooled...and i liked it!it was my sisters last night in town, and we decided to try something new.she said it was one of the best meals of the trip, and i agree!everything was delicious!we started with 3 appetizers  mac  cheese....sprinkled with potato chips! i know sounds weird, but was really great!bacon  chedder tater tots.... good flavor, the homemade ketchup was awesome. they were a tiny bit soggy and mushy. they lacked that wonderful tater tot crunch.and buffalo cauliflower just...yes! yummy!we all loved our entrees. chicken and waffles was a big hit! the flavor in the shrimp  grits was fantastic.over all we really had a great meal!
first visit and will come back! excellent service by sean!  loved the calamari, steak salad and fish and chips. my friend thought his fish was the same as hed eaten at remedys but cooked more well done a good thing. 2 jungle juices later and still sober so just a heads updont order for the tingling feeling, just order cuz it tastes good!
me and my husband really liked this place. it has a nice vibe, we both were saying how it would be a nice place to bring out of town guest. the food we had was delicious too, i had the watermelon tomato stack salad, absolutely delicious and so refreshing for this summer heat. my husband had the best tasting chicken and waffles made of cornbread and bits of fresh corn with the most flavorful gravy with bacon just put the diet aside for this, lol. we also shared the lemon meringue pie in a jar, yummy. my husband had a beer he really liked that had a fruit flavor to it and i had a watermelon mojo that was good too. our food suggestions were, thanks to our awesome waitress kaila, she was really helpful. i just love a well informed server when its your first time at a new place this is especially since my husband can take awhile to figure out what he wants, lol!. so kaila saved my tummy, she was so enthusiastic with her suggestions on the food my husband could make a quicker than usual decision. all i can say, is that you wont be disappointed if you stop by, and yes well be back.
this place is tucked away overlooking the cool quad space by crave and wolfgang puck. its really a neat space, and its perfectly situated for people watching and long brunches. i loved the green chile chicken and waffles, and the peanut butter and jelly french toast was pretty good, too. the nearly bottomless mimosa was the best ive ever had; its clearly handpressed, fresh juice. the staff is also amazing: they really get what a great customer experience should be, and they take pains to ensure every guest is having a good time.
the food was really good and our server venessa  was wonderful and made our experience extra special!!!
vanessa was the bomb today for brunch! last time i was here i was disappointed with the service so she really redeemed! ill be back for brunch! really great service!!! and ice cold mimosas!
crispy cauliflower. thats all you need to know.great cocktail and craft beer selection as well.live music and patio games round out a perfect evening in vegas.
i came in for brunch the other day and it was great! the service was quick and food tasted great, thank you vanessa! my favorite was the eggs benedict pizza. the atmosphere was bright, clean, and the public school theme was fun. we even planned to come back for brunch next week!
visited this new spot last night for beers with my buddies and was really excited to see variety on the menu, some new craft beers, authentic cocktail mixes unique to public school, and fabulous views of downtown summerlin. we sat inside because of the muggyhot night but once it cools down, the patio will be a nice chill spot to hang out!!i had the bison burger medium rare with house made fries and it was amazing. perfectly done to order. cant wait to come back and try out more on the unique menu here!!
great place! love the decor and food. they executed the school theme well with the composition book menus and homework togo boxes. very clever! i had the bison burger, and it was delicious ! the meat was tender and cooked to perfection! the side of fries were excellent as well and i really enjoyed the siracha ketchup. i also recommend their house pepperoni pizza. it has a thin, crunchy crust, and is topped with fresh jalapenos and incredible pepperoni. this is great place to come with friends, especially during recess aka happy hour. definitely will be returning to public school 702!
surprisingly good food, attentive staff that works as a team  not common  , and again, really good food.  the beer selection is solid, and the seating is great. also have charging stations in the booths.  study hall, pizza and beer  killer spot for drinking and studying.  the pizza is the sleeper, as well as the mezze appetizers.  mmmmm.
katie the server and sheri are so fun! the food was great as always but they make the experience top notch!!! i will always ask for one of these 2 when i come in.
public school impressed me. the concept was creative. we had the chicken and grits.our waitress was ruth, amazing! down to earth, knowledgeable, and to be frank,  shes very charismatic. the only thing better than the food was the service see previous paragraph   this place did it right!!!!!
had an awesome meal here last night!  the crispy buffalo cauliflower was totally craveable, and my farro, brussels sprout and scallop salad was delicious!  the scallops were perfectly cooked, and the combination of flavors and textures was awesome!  wish i could make vegetables this delicious!  cocktails were fantastic, and the decor was lovely and creative. will definitely return soon!
vanessa was incredible, the drinks were amazing, and the food was great. get the flat iron steak and mac n cheese. cancel the four roses and replaced with woodford in the lavender cocktail. thanks vanessa!
my girlfriend and i hit this place up for happy hour on a wednesday. the first impression is that this is a cool place, its decorated with a highschool motif and all the little details are incredible. their craft beer menu is excellent, although only a few beers are available at happy hour prices and their cocktails are very reasonably priced, but also not available at happy hour prices. the food menu is one of the most unique i have seen and the chorizo mac n cheese is off the chain! also, the service was excellent, tyler and mark were the kind of servers you usually only get at much more expensive establishments. we will definitely be back.
great atmosphere. good beer selection. on weekends they have bottomless mimosas. ruth our server was fantastic constantly checking to see if we needed anything. highly recommend going here if you are in the downtown summerlin area. get the cutting board, it is an excellent varied selection of meatscheesesetc.
everything here was fantastic for brunch on a saturday! the delicious coffee was served in a cool little cup with free refills. we ordered the jidori fried chicken and jalapeno cornmeal waffles, salmon with succotash, ahi tuna salad and eggs benedict pizza. the fried chicken was moist and delicious gravy on the side; the cornmeal waffles were the highlight of the dish. the pizza was out of this world delicious. it was a thin crust pizza with egg and hollandaise sauce on it. the salmon was so moist and perfectly done. the succotash with citrus sauce was an unexpected delight. even the standard ahi tuna salad was really good. i am looking forward to coming back here again and trying everything!
solid spot, great draft selection! lots of good local beers offered. they dont kill people on the prices either, i would come here more often but its kind of a far drive. food was decent, but the service was spot on and our waiter was really cool.
i absolutely love this place. the food is great and the atmosphere is relaxing. no matter how full you get, you must save room for dessert. oh  and you should ask for vanessa to be your food server, she made our first experience at ps702 a lasting one! when i review, 5stars are really reserved for all around excellence. if customer service isnt there and the food and atmosphere are awesome, i generally downgrade to 4stars. so  kudos to ps702 for impressing me in all areas e.g., food quality, service, atmosphere, cleanliness. we started with the crispy cauliflower. i know that might not sound very appetizing but it was. it comes with two sauces and the buffalo hot sauce is the bomb with cauliflower!then we each had a sandwich. he had the crispy chicken sandwich with french fries and i had the colorado lamb burger with quinoa and feta. yummy! my burger was perfect. the bun complimented the burger and held up until the very last morsel was gone. most buns seem to get soggy  not this one! thanks for the suggestions vanessa! with my meal, i had a pear cider and he had a bottle of sprite. i like the whole small soda bottles as it fits into the overall recess school lunch time theme. i just think maybe knocking off a 1.00 would make the parents a little happier. 2.75 for a small 8 oz soda is steep, especially on a hot day when drinking five of those could easily happen. good thing i decided to have a cold cider.i was pretty full after our meal but managed to get talked into sharing a dessert please mom please  grin grin grin. we ordered the cookie sandwich with nutella. this was super good! i cant wait to come back during the evening or when it is a little cooler outside. the patio is beautiful!
just had an amazing dinner here with 2 friends.  the waiternoah was amazing.  everything he suggest was absolutely mouth watering from beer to food, and he worked with us to accommodate a friends special dietary needs. we had frito pie, bangers and mash and jidori chicken after our deviled eggs appetizer.  the patio is beautiful. cant wait to bring family from out of town and coworkers here!!!  keep up the good work!!!
went to public school for the first time recently and had a really great experience. the public school theme was really cool. the menu was great. it had a lil something for everybody. the food we ordered was wonderful. our server was extremely attentive. our food came out super quickly. i ordered a guavalajara cocktail and it was one of the best cocktails ive ever had. my only criticism of the whole experience was that the bar took forever to get our drinks to us. however, our server ended up comping a glass of wine to make up for the wait so i cant be too annoyed. i will definitely be going back and recommending to friends.
great weekend brunch!  we enjoyed almost bottomless bloody marys, stuffed french toast and the huntsman bacon burger, yummy!  wow service from the front door greeting to our fun server ruth. the school theme decorations are fun and create an excellent atmosphere.
very comfortable and inviting. service was amazingask for matt he was the best! and the food is great! we went on saturday afternoon so it wasnt as busy which made for a great first impression. we are going back for happy hour next time.
i love this place. the crushed velvet cocktail is absolutely delicious. the theme is adorable here with the menus being composition notebooks and take out bags saying homework on them. i have already eaten here twice in the last couple weeks. love love love this place.
love love this place!!! the fam and i came to vegas to visit my brother and we ended up here. the theme is incredible, the food is yummy and tim our waiter was awesome!!!! will defiantly be back!!
the food was delicious especially the tater tots and chorizo mac n cheese. i have seen the knocks on service and i can honestly say our sever was tyler and he was very attentive and knows the menu very well.. we will be back!!!!
this place is a breath of fresh air in vegas. great happy hour, rotating beer menu, interesting flavor combinations. our service was fantastic. tyler made sure our drinks were filled and our food came out super fast. we gobbled it up. happy hour prices are top notch. i highly recommend the crispy cauliflower and the parmesan truffle frites. in the main menu we also enjoyed the cutting board meat and cheese selections. i dont know where the find all the bearded hotties but i like it.
came in with some of my boys and sat on the patio. brittany was our server. she was really nice and stayed on top of our beers. i dont think my glass was empty the entire night. the food was awesome. bacon cheddar tots were the favorite of the night. overall a great experience. ill be back.
had a great dinner here last friday night with family. tyler was our server and he did a fantastic job. we had a party of 11 with 4 little kids and tyler handled it well. his recommendation of the huntsmans burger was spot on. very tasty. the chorizo mac and cheese was awesome too. i just wish they had more ipas on tap.
located in the new shopping district of summerlin...public school 702 makes its home in downtown summerlin. a very modern and hip restaurant at that, themed after schooleducation like atmosphere. everything from their menus to decorations sets the place off right. this huge place located on the second floor also has an outdoor balcony area that almost rivals the inside seating of course depending on weather. this casual yet up beat restaurant provides quick and friendly service by their staff who are also dressed casual. not quite sure, we came on a weekend and noticed a weekend menu...so there might be a separate weekday one as well. they also have happy hour which they call recess which plays to the theme. menu choices were kinda small but quality and choices were there. it is a bar and grill brewery type of restaurant so expect the usual burgers and custom beers and alcohol. choices of even lamb and bison burgers which were tender, juicy and mouthwatering delicious. still public school 702 is family and kid friendly  very refreshing. as casual as it is, it still gives you that classy feeling with fun elegance. prices are average and maybe slightly a little more for casual dining...but service and ambience make up for it as well as the food. definitely recommend this place, at least to try out once or twice if you are in the area or after a long day shopping in downtown summerlin.
the food was fresh and great! excellent service great vibe and decor great for lunch and happy hour!
its exactly what downtown summerlin needed. craft beer and great food. the atmosphere is great and service is pretty good. hit or miss with service but the beer and food keep you busy! check out happy hour and late nights. bring back the pbj sliders
fantastic happy hour, great light bites such as the mushroom fontina flatbread and the deviled eggs...yes...the eggs! the decor is quirky and unique but just what youd expect at public school. make sure to get there before the buzzer to take advantage of their entire happy hour menu!!
ive heard a lot of great things about public school 702, and i have to say they did not disappoint. the venue itself has a wonderful theme. theres memorabilia all over the restaurant from generations of different schools. the bar area is reminiscent of a gymnasium with bleachers and a scoreboard. theres also shuffleboard, beer pong, and extremely large jenga. right off the bat, i was impressed.we were greeted promptly by our server, jared smith. he gave us a tour of the menu and went over the craft beer list. there are about 40 of them! he recommended the crushed velvet for me, as im not much of a beer drinker, and the tenaya brown for my husband, who is. the crushed velvet was delicious! its like a blackberry moscow mule. next we ordered the mezze plate and the crispy cauliflower, based on jareds recommendations, and both were delicious.for dinner i ordered the salmon with succotash and my husband had the fried chicken and waffles, also jareds recommendations. the salmon was fresh and paired delightfully with the succotash. the combination of the crushed velvet and the salmon was so good i had to order another one. my husband raved about his dish so of course i tried it, and yes it was delicious. a bit too many calories for me, but if thats no concern to you and its not too my husband, then this is the dish for you!all in all it was a great experience and the bill was extremely reasonable. the atmosphere is light and fun, and the food and beverage are delightful. i was very impressed with jared and his recommendations. we loved everything he picked, and he made the experience even more enjoyable. public school  we will definitely be back!
i went to public school in downtown summerlin with some friends on saturday night and had a great time. the place is huge! it is decorated by old public school relics and there is definitely some interesting history pieces of las vegas as well. we sat ourselves in the bar which is open seating and was great since we didnt have to wait. our server was a comical and energetic gentlemen named jared. great personality for a server. the craft beer menu is daunting but he got us some samples of recommendations and we all found something we liked. we ordered food family style so we could all try everything. we ordered the tots, mac and cheese, pepperoni pizza and the tuscan salad. everything was awesome, it came out staggered so were able to try it all hot and fresh. we would have tried the cookie sandwich but were stuffed. well come back and try it next time as well definitely be back. if youre going see if jareds working. he said there were two of them though so ask for jared smithe.
great concept here at downtown summerlin in the midst of several generic restaurants with the same old same old.        the public school theme is fun and the memorabilia on the walls and around the venue gives you a fun look into las vegass local past. the menu looked like a marble notebook and the cocktail napkin looked like a note passed from a classmate.                       our server, jared smith gave us a great rundown of the menu and explained the beer selection really well. we were able to sample quite a few before making our selections and by the time we left the restaurant we had ordered almost all oft them.          i would definitely recommend the shrimp and grits and the cauliflower, delicious. fun place, craft beer, good food, reasonable prices, and fantastic service. ill be back. :
been here three times now and have not been disappointed. mellow environment with both indoor and outdoor seating. the jidori chicken with jalapeno cheddar waffle was delicious. great choice of unique sides. house pizza is also a solid choice.
food was yummy! our server brandon was awesome his knowledge of the food was very impressive.
we have been back several more times and each time it only gets better! the food, the service, everything! we decided to try their brunch today and it was awesome! derrick was our server and he was great. we knew from the moment that he introduced himself that we were in good hands. the chicken sausage grits were great!! we will definitely be back!
the place: public school 702clean and well lit with equal parts natural light and soft bulb illumination. the staff was great and responsive and the place was clean. everything you might expect from a place in the center of the the newest place in town, downtown summerlin.food: c.c.b burger and friesthe burger was amazing with every ingredient showcased in ever bite. my only issue with the burger, it is crazy wet. quite the pool that left my hands sticky from the balsamic and my bun nearly disintegrated for the final bites.the fries are pretty standard in design and implementation but the way they compliment the burger is fantastic. whatever they did to make them work so well is a mystery since they appeared to be very normal fries.drinks: coffee milk stout from stone brewingexcellent lightweight stout with a dark complexion and a dark chocolate finish that is pleasant with every sip or gulp. if you like murphys or guinness this stout should put you right where you want to be.
about ten of my friends and i stopped by for sunday brunch and mimosas or micheladas, or beermosas, etc. and we had a blast. i ended up trying the ahi sandwich, which was pretty yummy  the french fries, though, were perfection.  our server, brittany craig, was super nice and attentive. thank you for a beautiful sunday morning!
what a great experience. my girlfriend  i were looking for a good local happy hour  came across this place. initially when we came around 5pm, it was a little quiet but as the night went on it really picked up. when we first walked in, we werent greeted but no big deal. we quickly found our own seats. our server jared was amazing and the cocktails were so good. the sliders were perfect as well as the adobo tacos. we plan on coming back here very soon! very nice happy hour selection.
came here for mimosa brunch and was not disappointed! 10 for mimosas  food was delicious, had the chicken sausage and grits! connor was our initial server and was amazing! he kept my drinks coming!
went here for the first time on 103015 at around 9pm with a few friends and i gotta say it was great. i liked the atmosphere. i wasnt to familiar with the beers they offered. so i asked tyler  shaved head, kinda built, tattoos... just in case theres another tyler there  our server, he asked what are my favorite beers. i told him him it was dos equis and blue moon. he said they dont offer mexican beers but they do serve a beer close to blue moon that was called hefenweizen. so thats what i got. i did like the beer and tyler was great on choosing the suggestion. and he gave great service to us all. thanks tyler. i enjoyed my over all visit will visit again. oh yea... the food was great too. i had the pepperoni pizza.
great food and great service highly recommended. go there for brunch and try the french toast you wont be disappointed
went for late lunch on a wednesday. service was excellent. the bbq bison burger had that authentic charbroiler taste with just a touch of not too sweet bbq sauce and emmental cheese. the wild mushroom  taleggio pizza had a bold and earthy mushroom taste. fries are served with sriracha ketchup. besides their regular tap beers, they have a rotating list of about twelve or fifteen first rate drafts.
ive come back to public school twice since my first review, and ive been ecstatic each and every time.the ahi tuna happy hour tacos are melt in your mouth delicious. i splurged on them with a friend before my main dish of bangers and mash. the bangers and mash is good, too, but not as good as some of their other items ive had.my last visit i ate the shrimp and grits and it was better than shrimp and grits ive had in charleston, sc. ahmayzing. i ate and ate and ate until i was about to burst, because i just couldnt get enough. the grits come in this fried patty form, but the minute you take a fork to it, it crumbles into succulent grits with a bit of a crunch on the outside. the shrimp was cooked perfectly, and the sauce that they pour over it all is so good id eat it as a soup by itself!weve had the meat and cheese platter, and the fish and chips too. everything is delicious.the only downside is that when the weather is too cold to enjoy sitting outside, the inside is noisy. like, it isnt going to be where you wind down after a long day. it will probably make your headache worse.overall, this is my absolute favorite restaurant in las vegas.
i have gone here for brunch on 2 occasions, and both times have been simply wonderful. i ordered the chicken sausage grits with the just about bottomless mimosas. first off, the grits were like heaven in my mouth. crispy on the outside and soft, perfect texture on the inside. this alone made me want to come back for more. secondly, the mimosas were delicious. for brunch they actually have several drinks options you can choose from  mimosas, beermosas, bloody marys, or michelada  and you can have 4 of them in any combination youd like for just 10, which i can say is more than plenty! the staff were friendly on both occasions and the atmosphere was great for socializing. there are also tvs for those people who want to get their football fix.
great food, good service. came in for a first visit and was definitely inpressed. the menu is a touch fancy but ask for a recommend item and you wont be disappointed. our server sheri was legit,  had to ask to spell her name, and thats the only thing we needed.  even the frys are good. soda comes in a glass bottle  coke  which i prefer as it is made with real sugar!  the sauces and specials are house made, and tons of good rotating beers on draft. we will return
love this place! ahi tacos and buffalo cauliflower is my favorite!! gets pretty busy for dinner so i suggest going early! pizzas are huge.. even the kids pizzas!
sunday brunch... awesome! chicken and waffles were amazing as well as the chicken sausage and grits. loved the almost bottomless mimosas. prices were reasonable and service was great! cool atmosphere. definitely will be back again.
good food, better service.  second time ive been there  the brown bag fries are a definite plus.  tyler, our server, was just awesome  would ask to sit in his area the next time and there will definitely be a next time.
i took my folks to this public school the last time i was in town. the service was terrific, the food delicious. if the weather is nice, ask to sit outside on the patio, where you may enjoy the view of downtown summerlin and, depending on where you sit, some of the gorgeous, colorful surrounding canyons. the portion sizes were good, and the meat was super juicy and tender. i especially liked the mashed potatoes that came with my meal. mmm. my folks and i also enjoyed our dessert. you really cant go wrong with the desserts there. all told, an a dining experience. bravo!

the micro beer and the burger was great, the taste of the micro brew had a nice fruit flavor that i never tried before.  my server was a super nice person
i was searching yelp on my visit to las vegas during the sema show and found this gem of a restaurant and i was so glad i did. the place was awesome looking, inside and out. the staff was super friendly and we were seated right away. the food was really good and the selection wasnt the normal stuff all other places have. if youre ever in vegas, look this place up. i wish they had one in south florida. keep up the good work 702!
love the food! love the atmosphere! super great place to grab cocktails and dinner and chill out on their patio with friends.
great time. came with three friends for happy hour. menu was wonderful and our server tyler was amazing. will return and ask to sit in tylers section.
the food is awesome and the service was great! we had the tater tots with cheese and bacon as appetizer and i ordered the bison burger ; i will def be back here with all my friends.
this place is amazing. the food is so flavorful. we had the fried cauliflower, tuna tacos and the ccb sand which. all of them were amazing. the service here is also phenomenal. our server was conner, definitely as for him. he is one of the best servers we have ever had. he is super friendly, polite and knowledgeable about the menu and all of the amazing beers they have. check this place out!
i went here for the first time for a company holiday party. i was kind of bummed because the menu for it had no vegan options. when the waiter came to take my order, i said id not be eating since there isnt a vegan option and he said hed see if he could fix that. the chef made a wonderful poached pear salad with arugula and candied pecans. then, for desert, i was completely surprised to be delivered a lovely poached pear sort of taco with fried pastry dough as the shell and chocolate and powdered sugar. it was my first time having pears and it was absolutely delicious. i really appreciate them going to far to accommodate my dietary preferences and not just for the entree, but dessert  it was really sweet of them, and they are lucky to have such a stellar chef! many places are nice and modify what they can to make recipes vegan, but pretty much none make a vegan dessert.my coworkers really all loved their meals, especially the buffalo cauliflower. give this place a shot! the atmosphere, staff, and food are wonderful.
the food was amazing! the beer selection is great. i will be back! over  over again ... i miss the place already lol. new fav!!
what a great pick got the family.  tater tots were great!  i had the shrimp and grits, much different version than i anticipated. ..but well worth it! wife had the chocken tortilla soup and roasted beet salad..that was well...just that,  nothing special..but ok. service was great..definitely will be back!
first time order food from this place..love the meat jun and the chow mein.big potions . will  recommend to all my friends
a new restaurant opened near my home silverado ranch bermuda.  i am from hawaii and i love trying new places that serve hawaiian poke and dishes im familiar with from home. my family and i ordered the meat jun, bbq chicken, ahi belly and fried noodles and 12 lb of their shoyu poke.  as i talked to workers the fish is fresh and its never frozen.  we eat sushi and poke a lot here in vegas and this is the first place that i know of that has fresh fish. the friendly cashier explained to me about their menu and the fresh fish.  two thumbs up in my book!!  due to their soft opening their menu is limited. i will be back soon to try other dishes on their menu.  i am a huge supporter of local businesses.
i visited the soft opening of kahuku poke and its is delicious. my family and i enjoyed their bbq chicken, chicken katsu,  bbq beef short ribs. definitely looking forward to visit and highly recommend this hawaiian bbq to all my friends and family.
definitely go here if you want some great fresh poke!  the menu may be limited because it is a soft opening, but the delicious options only left me wanting more and feeling excited for the full menu to be available.  shoyu poke and the spicy chicken are my favorite thus far.
went to this restaurant very clean. i had the garlic shrimp plate and it tasted like when i visited hawaii. brought back memories from my fond vacation. due to soft opening im looking forward to grand opening. the staff was so friendly and welcoming..
this place is ridiculously good. i had the short ribs and the chicken katsu and both were fantastic. best lunch ive had in a long time
happy that this location is closer to my house so i dont have to drive farther to get to island flavor!prices are reasonable and the poke is fresh as you can expect getting shipped in. the restaurant is clean and staff is friendly.
i have came here multiple times during their soft opening and have had a wonderful experience! i understand that it was a soft opening and their would be a limited menu to choose from but that was ok with me! when i walked in the restaurant was very clean and presented very nicely. the menu was easily seen and pictures were displayed. the first thing i ordered here was the small shoyu poke, it was seasoned nicely on a bed of rice and extremely fresh! no frozen fish here! i literally saw them carving up a big tuna through their window, now thats fresh. the next time i came in and tried the meatjun. its was incredible! thinly sliced beef in and egg wash and pan friend served over rice with their delicious spicy soy sauce and kim chi. i will defiantly be back to try out other dishes as well as different types of poke when they arrive! and dont forget the different varieties of hawaiian sodas they have also.
absolutely wonderful poke, got the shoyu poke bowl and meatjun.   rice was perfect and the cashier was very pleasant.    definitely will be a regular here
first time trying today, friendly cashier. ordered meat jun, 2 item combo of meat junchicken katsu, and fried noodles. meat jun was delish, the best ive had in my 13 years of being in lv. better than juns  ross js. the katsu sauce was different than any other hawaiian bbq places and the best yet too. fried noodles were your typical fried noodles you get in hi. the prices are comparable to where i am from on kauai. overall an awesome restaurant. its a must try but just remember its their soft opening and menu was limited as of today. i wanted to try a bento and that wasnt ready yet.
its hard to find good local hawaiian food here in vegas. i was pulling into another place and saw this was new so decided to give it a try. i had the meat junbbq short rib combo, it was excellent. reminded of of dong yangs in wahiawa. i also bought some limu poke after talking to one of the workers. they claim the ahi is flown in fresh weekly from the islands, and i believe it. its definitely not frozen and thawed like many other places around town serve. its a little pricey but it would have to be to have it flown it. and with how good it is its worth the price. overall a great place, ill definitely be back. aloha!
when i am away from home oahu, i miss my poke.  first off, i would not eat any fish that is previously frozen, it must be fresh.  i love the fact that their fish is fresh.  if you are from hawaii, its a must for you to try it!  for those that cant tell the difference between fresh and frozen go to the cheap places.
been here twice and i love it! the guy that takes our order is always so nice. he makes sure that he greets the customers and never ignores them. the food here especially their poke is so delicious. i had the spicy poke and the limu poke, and both was super good. oh! the garlic shrimp is bomb! the only thing is that they close at 8 pm, in which i think is too early here in vegas. but definitely my top hawaiian place to go to.
just had lunch with my daughter  kahuku poke  bbq. what can i say, awesome! i had the 19 loco moco and she had the 40 bbq chicken  beef. the loco moco was great, but i think the bbq chicken was my favorite still debating. we both loved our meals and shared with each other. she is a picky eater, so for her to say it was good really means it was great! at first, i thought it was a little expensive. but, after we got our food, i realized it was a good price because the portions were so large. my daughter turned her meal into two by eating half a taking the rest home for dinner. i unfortunately, did not have any left to take home.  we will return to kahuku!!!
of all the local food restaurants in las vegas this is the best!! fresh, clean and original the poke tastes like i just bought it from kahuku superette in kahuku hawaii. meat jun, roast pork and laulau on point!! thankyou kahuku poke ill be baaaaack! go  big redd
i went there few days ago and also that was my first time to eat hawaiian food. my firs time to eat kahuku was wonderfull!! i never forget it and i wanna go again.... fresh fish!! especially i was so impressed at meat jun and shrimps. i hope our county has same restaurant like here!
this place is awesome. it has some of the best poke outside of hawaii. the bbq chicken and spicy chicken is great. my son loved the loco moco. the service was excellent and the prices are good. it is definitely a place to try out. well be back to try some more offerings from their menu.
i had a wonderful experience here. hands down, the best poke in vegas. im from hawaii so i know how good poke taste like. apparently the owner of this joint is also the same owner of kahuku superette back on oahu, the poke at kahuku superette is one of the best on the island. i just wish the spicy ahi was more fresh, but cant really complain much since we dont leave near an ocean. i dont know why a lot of people are complaining about the price. i think its reasonable  you get what you pay for in a good way. most plate lunch places back home range about the same price. i also know that fresh ahi is limited in vegas so of course they would need to up the price. i ordered the kalbi, bbq chicken, shoyu poke, spicy ahi, and meat jun. they all tasted really good. better than ll in my opinion. they gave a generous amount of meat and 2 scoops of rice with mac salad. the employees were really nice and sweet on top of that. i only waited less than 10min max for my order. im planning on visiting again soon!
poke and barbecue was delicious. i loved their employees when i came in for a visit.  i ordered the barbecue short ribs and it was an outstanding experience! their rips although difficult to cut around all those bones, you will taste tender, delicious , mouth watering meat, that will make you go back for more.  get a small cup for free refills.
recently moved to the mainland from hawaii so was craving some local food. my first visit, ordered the spicy ahi bowl. the bowl literally came with just rice and ahi. felt like it was missing some greens as a bowl in hawaii comes with veggies, but its ok, the flavor of the ahi was good and spicy! i also tried the kalbi, that was so good too, the perfect amount of fat and chared flavor, just like back home. oh and we also ordered quarter pound of the ahi poke  sooo ono, melt in your mouth, fish is fresh!!
went here and thought the prices were outrageous but when i received my meal... omg! it was so much food that me,  my wife and daughter couldnt finish e the mix combo plate... i definitely give this place 5 stars since food was good amount for the price and also quality was the best!
a friend told us to try this poke restaurant. i was pleasantly surprised that it is a full hawaiian restaurant with everything from poke, eat jun, chicken katsu, fried saimin, musubis, loco moco, etc.we ordered  spicy poke and shoyu poke  both were excellent.   the shoyu poke is their signature dish and it does not disappoint.  it has a great tasting bold sauce.  the fish is sooo good.  i have had poke all over town, this is the freshest tasting poke in las vegas.   you can definitely tell this is fresh and has not been frozen.we also ordered meat jun, bbq chicken,  chicken katsu,  and fried saimin.  the portions are gigantic.   my meat junkatsu combo was large enough for 3 people.  you should ask for the spicy meat jun sauce.the staff is very very friendly.   they were very helpful and always smiling.  we will definitely be back to try some other items like the ahi bibimbab.
love this place. foods consistent, friendly employees, clean environment and overall a great place to eat plate lunch hawaiian kine food!!!
we went back to give them another try and it was amazing!we ordered the bbq chicken and bbq beef combo. plenty to share with my partner!cashier or owner remembered me and told me thank you for giving them another chance. next chance poke and i will tell my hawaii friends.
so amazing i came in in the last ten minutes without noticing and they were so nice had no problem whipping up a breakfast for me always amazing food and service why is everyone in coffee time !?

i youre lucky enough to get an invite...youre in for a real treat.  best sushi available in the burgh.
awesome!    invite only place!     fish flown in from all over the world.     snapper from indonesia, tuna and hamachi from japan.    uni from hokkaido.      yummy!!!h
the best crab cakes in pittsburgh
the most authentic japanese restaurant in pittsburgh!
the best alaskan king crab outside of alaska.  i heard they just added a michelin rated chef, cant wait until the next dinner.  definitely hidden gem of pittsburgh
i get fresher fish than them but thats because i live in hawaii. well, its a very very exclusive invite only place and really worth the wait. i think ive been here over a dozen times and each time it was fabulous although they sometimes serve things other than sushi.
they did good work in a timely fashion. rocky answered all my questions about the work and did not disturb my tenant while completing the work. thank you rocky, great job.
we live in mountains edge  far sw side of the las vegas valley. even though our house is only a few years old, the fascia and shutters were faded and last february the hoa said that a repaint was due.doug and rocky did a wonderful job in matching the colors and doing the painting. they held fast to the estimate and showed up on time. they were always courteous and friendly.i highly recommend the fascia kings.
rocky and dan were great to work with.  in the run up to actually deciding to go with fascia kings i did receive quotes from several different painting companies that were at least 250 more than what rocky charged me for the same work.  they showed up on time, colored matched my fascia, and finished the job in a matter of hours.  we are quite pleased with the finished job and would highly recommend them to anyone needing fascia work done.
above and beyond in service! arrived on time, did what was agreed upon and even then some! very reasonable rates! i will use them again! rocky and ken are great people and hard workers!
rocky did a great job with my house!  he came over at the time we setup and gave me a quote.  we agreed on the price and he came over and did the job right away.  the house was painted on time and looked amazing!  he made everything so easy and made sure to clean up everything when he was done.  it was definitely a very easy process and i was very happy with the service.  if you need your house done, you dont need to look anywhere else. rocky is the one to call.  my neighbors were very impressed at how great my house looks now too!
this place is amazing. yea, theyve only been open 2 days, but everyone is on point. menus are the exact same as regular hooters and they are not jacking the price up like other restaurants would do being in this prime poolside location. drink come in a plastic cup because we are next to a pool! they actually stay cooler in a plastic cup over a glass mug.  highly suggest checking this place out, especially when the open the main restaurant in a few weeks.
amberlynn is amazing here! she was fast, reliable, and so sweet. great customer service. i would recommend this new hooters location at the palms to anyone who loves a nice pool view and some delicious drinks and food thank you again amberlynn for such great service. we will be back ;
conveniently located by tye pool area. and is way cheaper than the pool bar. plus autumn really did a good job serving us. shes really cool too.
i ate here a few times during my stay here in vegas last week and over all it was a great experience. food was good took a minute to come out but i just enjoyed another drink while it did; i was not in a hurry to leave, good atmosphere, and service was great. i know ill be staying at the palms next trip to visit you guys again.
seriously had a blast here! i came in on a thursday by myself i know creeper status, but i was staying at the palms, so back off. immediately, i was greeted by bartender autumn and miska. they were amazing! the service was great and the conversations were even better. the staff amanda, autumn, adrienne, kylee and miska not only were very hot and nice... i know, i know, im in hooters, thats what they do. but they really made me feel like i was one of their friends. i will definitely be back!!!
we came in here in a saturday 71815 around 5:45 pm we were seated and soon after greeted by our waitress.  i wish i could remember her name.  she has the sweetest personality, all the other ladies that we encountered were up beat, happy to be working.  you could tell the way they carried themselves they were hard workers.  i guess being that its brand new, theyve had a lot of hiccups, she was asking how the food was when we noticed how fantastic she really was. usually nobody ever asks!  she made us feel so welcomed.i didnt have any complaints about the food or staff.this location is facing the pool so you may want to check it out when its cool day with a light breeze.  personally i enjoy not being stuck in the ac because then you have to eat it before it gets cold. this didnt happen here since its all facing the outside pool area.not a place for kids since their bar is literally right there in the seating area the other half is not open. i cant believe somebody had kids in here with all the video poker being so close by... i cant wait to come back again! we had a lot of fun, we didnt drink alcohol we had a fun time with the staff and music.
great service where it matters most. i left my ipad air at the restaurant and after contacting them, the general manager got my mailing address, confirmed it via email and asked a favor from his girlfriend to ship it out to me since he has a restaurant to run. i am very grateful for the return of my ipad which i use both for personal and work. in terms of food, i ordered chicken wings and it was really, really good. i was in a hurry and the waitress was very nice about it and made sure that my food was served quickly.
i stopped by with some friends on a wednesday evening, 7222015. we sat out on the patio area. fortunately the weather that evening was wonderful. jamie, our server, was great. she paid attention to us and was fun to have around. very nice and energetic too.the downside of our visit was when they ran out of the fresh brewed iced tea, so they didnt have any for refills. the manager chris came over and explained the issue to us, apologized for the oversight, and promised that more was being made as we spoke. we were asked if there was anything else we wanted while waiting for the fresh tea. problem arose, problem solved. how problems are handled provides true measure. chris was very nice and helpful. glad the he was the manager to take care of everything.the food was good, drinks were good. we had a great visit.they are still in their soft opening. additional area plus an upstairs area are still under construction. i was told it would be about another month before the official opening.
i stopped in the new hooters at the palms yesterday and it was terrific. my server, adrienne was very friendly and approachable. the food was well prepared. at this time, the only area open is a small seating area and the patio overlooking the palms pool. when the rest of it is open, it will be the largest hooters in the world. i think it will be an amazing place when its completed based on the laid back, hanging at the beach atmosphere theyve been able to generate so far. great place ! not the same old hooters. check it out !
i was in there last week to check out this new hooters! its a great location with a great view of the pool. the managers and staff are very friendly and helpful! the food was delicious. i definitely plan to go back and take my family and friends.
i go to hooters on tropicana a lot tryed the one at the palms was very good restaurant was near pool they made mistake on order and they gave it to us on house great customer service
although i must admit to being partial to hooters because i married and ex hooters girl r.n. .but when we were served by marilyn jannet you get service can can only be measured by total class act.from beginning, to a never ending service, smile, sexiness, beautiful, charming, and the total package. she makes it where you dont want to leave!!!!!!! i always ask when shes in, there may be better servers but i doubt it.....please let the manager read this, it also doesnt hurt that she has my sister first name. she has dangerous curves that attract attention. service with a dash of sexy smile. if ever a waitress could fill, out a uniformaccept the wife  marilyn does. a smile , a hug, and you dont want to leave......please manager kudos galore.....shes my kinda girl....: mwah!
the service here is very friendly and the wings are delicious! the 83 margarita for 5 is delicious :
this hooters is amazing, biggest hooters i have ever seen, food was brought to us fast and we are a party of 7. seated promptly and drinks came just as fast. our food is amazing as our server amberlyn is just as amazing!!! we wil be back for sure!
met with a friend tonight 9915 at the new huge location inside the palms and had a great time meeting the general manager don and several waitresses and host. everyone was cool and welcoming. very nice open atmosphere with plenty of bar space, tables, 2 floors  second floor wasnt open yet and  pool side tables. there are plenty of large screen tvs and a great energy to the area. food and drinks came out in a timely fashion and was excellent. the grand opening is the first monday night football  and im sure it will be packed. our waitress, christina , was attentive, hot , sassy and knows what shes doing. cant wait to come back!
i cant believe how beautiful this new hooters is the staff is amazing the manager donald was so friendly this is my new home thank you palms!!
ladies are police and attending making sure your taken care of, im just here for togo food and they are all political and well angered ladies i appreciate they are swell and understanding, i love hooters chicken wings they are the best old fashion and delicious. this place is extremely large and have more televisions then ive seen at a bar if you need to watch a game....they have you covered, i dont drink beer so i cannot say how the beer is but i bet you can always get a cold on here from the ladies that bring you great wings!
good service and attentive girls. came here bc im staying at the hotel and love the fried pickles. pretty empty for the worlds largest. legit casino sports bar.
stopped in to watch the ufc fight since i was staying at palms place for a conference. front desk staff was so helpful and nice. we were immediately say at the nicest bartender thanks tiffany greeted us instantly. of course this being my first time she was so sweet and answered all of my dumb questions with a smile
good food, good assortment of tap beers, and really friendly service.  i was in pittsburgh for a few days and found this on my first day.  i ended up going every night during my stay, and would go again.surprisingly good food for a simplelooking bar.
after being refused service up the street i wandered in to see what this place was like, extremely friendly bartender was super helpful and had no problem helping my friend and i think of drinks! will most definitely return anytime im in oakland! great wings! try the super hot sauce!
i found this business on groupon for a pretty good deal. when i called for an appointment the girls got me in right away and came to the location which was closest to my house. shalena the girl who worked on me took her time and did a very excellent job. she was professional and let me relax during my appt. my  lashes have now lasted for about three weeks and still look intact. shalena was very specific and thorough with the aftercare and what to do and do nots... even though i go swimming quite often and love the water . i would highly recommend shalena for lash extensions if youre looking for someone to do them and you dont have someone already already.!!
had a really great experience. the instructor amanda was very informative and helpful. answered all my questions. the class was awesome, learned a lot of dos and donts. the step by step procedure is on point. i left the training very confident. she assured me that shell be there to answer any of my questions. the class included the materials i needed to start eyelash extensions. whats great about it is that she also sells the materials here in las vegas. i would definitely recommend this training to anyone interested in becoming an eyelash extension tech.
my lashes look great! mo takes her time and listens to make sure you are happy when you leave her chair and the prices are great! i definitely recommend her!
definitely an amazing spot i was there for the grand opening and they have the same delicious food as every other alan now i will definitely be coming here often
this place is a must .they have the best chicken that i have ever tried ,i think it is much better than the raising canes.  it is a definitely a quick and easy ,good choice for food .the workers were very friendly ,very good music
bombest ll spot in vegas. great customer service. the cashier was super nice, never had any problems. would most def come here again. thanks gabi!
really like this location,they give u such big amount of food,always get the bbq mix with chicken katsu ,always cooked fresh and you get a lot  lot lot .. the spam musubi is also delicious here ,wonderful experience!!!look forward to trying more food here next time
must say im from hawaii and the fried spam saimin had me reminiscing back to keiki days , to the old manapua man! thanks for the excellent customer service, and the friendly staff for taking there time to help a local girl like me!
good hawaiian food with friendly service and enormous portions. i got the bbq combo plate with beef, short ribs, and i substituted the bbq chicken with chicken katsu curry. the meal was huge and everything was cooked well. after living in hawaii for close to four years, this place brought back memories of all of the good local food you used to eat back in the day. i wish they served meat jun though.
i have purchased from these guys a half dozen times over the last 8 years or so and they are great to work with every time.  i have never had a blind come in not sized correctly.  i did have one with the cord not working right but they sent out a replacement right away.  they have excellent service and are very friendly which is refreshing.
meka is an amazing hair stylist.  she works wonders with color  her hair cuts are spot on.  she spends the extra effort to do a very thorough job.  my hair is always so shiny  soft.  i definitely recommend her for any hair styling needs.  it is such an amazing experience when she shampoos my hair she spends the time to give me a very relaxing scalp massage.  i also recommend the deep conditioning treatment.
loooove it!! so, i wasnt on the same page with my old stylist, stumbled upon meka and the girl nailed it! dull color is now bright and shiny again and the cut she did made my hair look as healthy as ever! she uses fantastic products and spends the extra time to make sure you are happy. dont hesitate, go to meka!! stylist for life!!!
meka  is one of those rare persons who despite her youth is an expert at her craft.  she knows products, styles, colors and gives a great massage when she washes your hair.  i am glad i found her.eva
meka has done my hair for about 3 years. she is the only stylist i trust. i like to change up my hairstyle often and she has proven to be a master at any cut and style. her hair wash massages are very relaxing. meka is a nice person and great at her job. i recommend her to everyone.
meka did such an awesome job on my hair. i have blonde hair but for years it has been on the gold side. my previous hairdresser always said that my hair just pulled gold tones and that it would always be like that. she also said that if i tried to make it an ashy color it would turn green. meka assured me that it would not turn green. not only is my hair not green but it is a beautiful shade of blonde that looks like a natural blonde. it is exactly what i was hoping for.  she also gave me the best head massage i have ever had. i would pay just for that !
went to see meka for a new cut. she did an awesome job! i went from long hair to shoulder length hair. i showed her how short and what style i wanted and she delivered. she did an awesome job! i will definitely be seeing her again!
my family is extremely blessed to be under the care of someone who is following her true passion in life. alica truly loves what she does and it shows in so many ways. she has went over and beyond for my family and been at our beck and call anytime we needed her. she exceeded what was expected! we would have never gotten the care for someone else that we have got from alica. we are forever grateful!
i hired alicia to be my doula and monatrice sp?  she was wonderful. she spent time with us before the birth initial and second meetings and we asked tons of questions. i let her know things that i was and was no comfortable with and she was very accepting. on the day of my birth, we called her first and she came over to see how i was doing and told me to enjoy the day now and to call her when i felt like i needed her. we did just that  she returned after my second call and sat with me and my husband as i had contractions. she checked me when i asked and tried some massage. after, trying a few different positions and the shower, we left for the hospital on my command. she advocated for me in the hospital and answered any questions that i had. she held my legs the entire time i was pushing 2 hours and stayed for about an hour after my son was born to help him latch and talk with us. then she left to give us time together with our new addition. we already had appointment scheduled for my few week check in and that went great. she listened to my concerns and troubles and offered help because my placenta ended up being ruined.  my husband and i really appreciated her support and all the advice she provided us. it was worth every penny to have her there. i would not hesitate having her as my midwife if we ever do this again.
i called to buy a washer and dryer set.  tony had a refurbished set available i asked him about a guarantee  and he gave me a 3 month written guarantee and the set works great and looks almost new. thanks tony!
mon dieu questce que jaime cet endroit ! tommy est un coffee shop qui a ouvert il y a seulement quelques mois et il est deja un lieu incontournable de montreal ! et cest exactement lidee que je me faisais du coffee shop de mes reves ! oui ouitout est parfait : la deco, laccueil, et en plus, il y a du choix ! patisseries, boissons, cafe, the, salades... je me suis laissee tenter par un the chai latte et un cookie a larachide et au chocolat : un pure delice !effectivement, les prix sont assez eleve mais la qualite est bien la ! courrezy :
best latte weve had yet in montreal, and they also do tea right loose full leaf in a filter pot
awesome place. good coffee. i would recommend both carpaccio and mocha here. now i am just type so yelp lets me complete my comment and not bugging me about the comment being short. anyways, the coffee is good
delicious food from a real italian chef. finally, i found italian food in charlotte. not a knock off but the real soul of an italian kitchen. perfection from the service to the kitchen i cant wait to return.
real italian food served with wonderful service! try the primitivo wine. fresh, unique, fantastic.
simply fabulous. my husband and i went for restaurant week and everything we ate was super delicious!! the service was top notch too. the servers here really know how to connect with the diners. very tiny inside and slightly cramped, but they do well with the space and make you feel comfortable.
what a great evening. such a pretty, quiet, romantic spot. the menu changes daily. the food is incredible, and the service perfect. the timing between courses could not have been better. we were able to talk and enjoy our wine without feeling rushed. we split the octopus, the linguine with clams and the filet which had fresh tomatoes and a soft, delicate cheese....perfect.
spectacular! absolutely the closest to an authentic italian restaurant you will find in charlotte. trust me, i know because i am married to someone from italy. we took his parents there and they were so impressed. they are extremely picky when it comes to eating out but loved their experience here. wonderful authentic dining experience.
i was a loyal patron of lili co at the old location in le plateau and i was worried when i heard that they were moving to a bigger space. well fear not my foodies, for the quality is exactly the same, the kitchen and bar are wide open and the food is still soooo good. the feeling of care and thought into every ingredient is still there and the cocktails are incredible more room  more boozy options! best thing about this move? they now do lunch! the menu is always changing, but come for the brunch or dinner and arrive with a group so that you can try a bite of everything! the fish was cooked perfectly, the fiddleheads were divine and my partners meat dish was fall off the bone, melt in your mouth good.
i love this resto.  it is a real montreal gem, creative cooking, casual, servers who care and i will be back!
apres avoir goute le brunch, decouverte des plats du soir avec montreal a table :nous y allons avec enthousiasme et des attentes pour ce repas !pour les entres : flanc de porc, salade de choux, beurre de cajou : une belle decouverte dassociation de saveurs entre le cajou et le flanc de porc!  champignons sauvages poches au beurre, puree de choufleur caramelise, chapelure de pain noir : une bonne portion de champignons sauvages, bien assaisonnes. tres bonne puree de chouxfleur caramelises. tout bon pour cette entree.cela commence bien, est ce que cela va aussi bien suivre ?!?!pour les plats : gnocchi a la fajiole, feves romano, tomates fumees, parmigiano : mmm rien de vaut de bons vrai gnocchis! la sauce est savoureuse, sur le moment jaurais prefere en avoir plus, mais la quantite est quand meme correcte.  pieuvre grillee laquee a lhibiscus, chorizo, edamame, poudre dolives noires, citron : miam miam miam. 2 bons morceaux de pieuvre avec des petits morceaux de chorizo qui vont a merveille tout comme les edamames. un melange entre du sucre, sale et epice. vraiment super plat avec des saveurs particulieres, bravo au chef jai adore :le second service est donc a la hauteur de lentree, finissons avec la touche sucree : beignets maison avec confiture dairelles : bien pour finir avec des bonnes petites beignes. brioche avec boule de glace au miel et beurre de noix : tres bonne glace! vraiment! le contraste de chaleur entre la glace et le beurre fait que le tout se melange tres bien et les saveurs sen retrouvent multipliees!au niveau du service cetait un peu lent au debut mais cetait le temps que cela se lance. apres rien a reprocher, beaucoup de reactivite pour leau, le pain et la presentation des plats.nous navons pas ete decu de revenir ici et on a autant aime que la premiere fois que lon etait venus pour le brunch.que cela soit un brunch ou un autre repas la qualite des plats est au rdv :je vous le conseille sans hesitation

tres beau spot cafeine dans un quartier qui en manque.belle deco, bon cafe de chez pilot.beaucoup de details dans lamenagement qui donnent une vraie identite au lieu.
super bel ambiance !
this cute cafe opened up across the street where i live not so long ago. its very comfortable inside and im kind of obsessed with the graffiti design inside the cafe. being a tea addict and walking in for the first time and noticing that their speciality is tea got me so excited. i must say, they have a huge variety of tea and their iced teas are amazing. the wifi is great, the seating is very comfortable you can also sit outside on a nice day and the owners there is two are extremely nice. we always chat with the one that works in the evening and it makes our visit ten times better. i think what im also really impressed by is their hours. theyre open very early 7 am and close very late which is rare for a cafe in montreal. sometimes i dont really like how early most cafes close here but its nice to know this one stays open late, especially because they have good coffee. i have yet to go there for some breakfastlunch but will definitely be doing so very soon!  hanaer
i was overwhelmed by the wall of tea varieties,so i got a delicious latte and some fresh pastries to take home and share. very cozy and friendly spot.
ive made it a habit to go there at least once a week, its my favourite cafe in montreal. its absolutely awesome. if you love tea, its the place to go, and if you dont, their coffees are excellent as well!
what a stellar spot. i have to thank one of my friends for introducing me to this place! it is such a perfect place to study and the selection of teas and snacks are great for a long essaywriting haul. i got a christmas tea and cozied up in the secret downstairs basement lounge and really enjoyed my time. the tea was great, the service was so so so friendly and everything about this place made me want to come back.
adorable little cafe specializing in tea on prince arthur. when i got there, the cafe was empty, so the barista was extremely attentive when helping me pick out a tea, armed with suggestions and always ready to let me try more. i ended up picking a lovely peachapricot blend that i had with a shot of milk their london fog. even when the cafe got busier later in the day, the barista always made sure to ask if everything was alright and if i wanted more water. later in my stay i had an amazing croissant egg sandwich with cheese and ham, it was absolutely delicious! would definitely recommend this to anyone craving something fresh and savory here.important for all the students out there: their wifi was very fast, they have great tables and workspace, the music is a little on the loud side but if it bothers you you can ask to turn it down. i definitely plan on returning for more tea and good study vibes.
things i love about thrifty joes: 1. great selection, especially for students who have required reading and readers looking to buy used or just cheaper books.2. great prices.  you can sometimes find several different prints, covers, and varying levels of usednew books which also means varying prices depending on what you can afford. 3.friendly, chill employees 4. generally a peaceful, quiet environment 5. also has cds, records, and a mailing center its basically the greatest.
nice little store with more than enough to keep you busy. plenty of books, a couple of video games, but best of all is the vinyl. came home with 2 vinyl records animals and rolling stone they played flawless in my early 80s player. prices are priced accordingly.i will come back for future needs. thanks guys.
this was such a great family owned restaurant. the owners are so welcoming and friendly. the food was excellent and the prices are very reasonable.  definitely will return here.
everyone here is so friendly!! family owned and the food is absolutely delicious. i got the pot stickers and the house fried rice with bbq pork, plus a yummy boba smoothie.the rice was filled with tons of fresh carrots, bok choy, green and white onions. so good! a full plate of it! the pot stickers were delicious and fresh! i watched them make my honeydew melon smoothie right in front of me, tasted amazing. im definitely always coming back when i crave anything from smoothies to rice.
the best i have tried for a while. their house fried rice is so addictive! drunken noodles are to die for, and the wonton soup had the right amount of spices and vegetable consistancy. price is a steal for all the great flavors their food has to offer, not to  mention their out of this world customer service  not like other places in town where they lack in that department . will come here often after they let us know about their karaoke and poetry nights! you guys are great!
this review was for my 1st visit on thursday, july 2ndthanks to other reviews, this place was on my short list to try.  my colleagues and i stopped in for lunch, and the first thing we noticed was the cool celebritylike backdrop on the far wall.  cheesy but fun  a little tongueincheek so to speak.  the 2nd thing to really pay attention to, as mentioned by other reviewers, is the specials board.  hh prices from 11  3 pm.  yes!i ordered the thairitto and the deviled eggs, and my colleagues ordered the beef  broccoli, orange chicken, and pot stickers.  we each tried each others dishes and all were excellent with generous portions!thairitto consists of pad thai with a lime sauce wrapped in a tomato flour tortilla.  so fresh, and served cool.  perfect on a hot vegas summer day!  the beef  broccoli was tender and the sauce was well balanced, not too spicy, salty or overbearing.  the orange chicken was well flavored as well, with crunchy pieces of chicken nothing soggy about this dish and lots of beautiful colors of various vegetables.  the pot stickers were cooked beautifully with a delicate soyvinegar sauce that was also well balanced, not too salty or vinegary.staff is very friendly, and chef popped out to check on us.  my colleagues received a workrelated discount that i did not not the restaurants fault, and chef generously offered a dessert on the house.  wow!  pretty amazing customer service!  we all shared a slice of the key lime pie, which we initially said we were too full and would just try a bite, but of course we ate it all.be patient for your food  its cooked to order.  this is not panda express where the food is precooked and sitting in a warming dish.  it is well worth the short wait!  thank you, jwok cafe, for a wonderful lunch!  well be back...
i always love to eat here it feels like home, good food, very friendly staffs.you have to try the smoothies they are good.
absolutely amazing customer service. their friendliness is a 10 star! everything freshly made, not frozen. most authentic boba in vegas. food was perfect. highly recommend!
first time here! ordered food through yelp. the food isnt oily like other places. i got the drunken noodles and it was delish! again, not too oily. i also bought the garlic chicken with fried rice! it was kicking with garlic, which i dont mind it at all because the fried rice was moist and tasty! prices are bad either. plus, they give discount for police officers, military, and other community service members. not sure about teachers, etc. not to mention, they were very nice and had great customer service! i will be back when im on that side of town!
delicious food thats made to order! i highly recommend the boba as well! super friendly staff and very welcoming environment! i went twice in two days! haha
classy and elegant with a great vibe. a refreshing change from your typical neighborhood dive bar and a wonderful addition to downtown vegas. amazing signature cocktails.
nice place to unwind, great drinks and atmosphere! my favorite drink is the heat. love this cute place!
a great new addition to downtown las vegas located on the first floor in juhl!fabulous atmosphere, drinks, and music.  the staff was great and jerome the owner is there to greet you with a smile!  in addition to list of specialty cocktails, they make an incredible moscow mule!
my husband and i had the pleasure to visit classic jewel last night and it exceeded our expectations in every way.  first of all, its cozy with retro decor.  the dj was playing a cool mix of music.  the bartender asked us our names...cant remember the last time thats happened!  the drinks were delicious and very original.  the owners are as classy and elegant as the establishment itself.  this place really feels like a locals place but also a place where even an outsider would be made to feel welcome.  we will be back!
there is more fun stuff to do every day in the downtown area!the classic jewel is on of the new cocktail spots! we went over to meet a friend for a drink., and he suggested this new adorable little neighborhood bar. it is super comfortable inside, the staff is fantastic! fun, friendly and happy to see you!lots of funky cocktails to choose from, as well as the classics!we had a great night! cant wait to go back.
great place if you live downtown. justine just waited on us and was very pleasant. they remember locals.
great place love the owners ... my second time there i like the fact that its quaint and good music is all ways a plus...,i will definitely be back!!!
i currently live at the juhl, which is a highrise in downtown las vegas. this bar just opened on the ground floor of the apartment building. theyve already made it a priority to establish good relationships with their guests, most of which are residents. try their gin cocktails  theyre fantastic!the only downside is that theres one single bathroom which means you may have to wait a few minutes, but hey  i can just go upstairs and use my own :
this place is the real deal. most professional bartenders and most welcoming atmosphere one could imagine.
dj slo at the classic jewel . best ever  love his music from neo soul to rb to old school  soft jazz .its very romantic  chic with delightful lovey people  . drinks are very yummy  i enjoy their wine selection. live music saturdays phenomenal musicians
the heat amazing margarita. bartender was sweet. the owner was very cool. i highly recommend this place. come watch some games on their tvs.
nice little romantic junt. i was invited by the owner.this is a nice place to chill  rock yo hips  wave and sip. i will return here many more times with the hubby. i just love a spot where there are no yelling children and you can drink and mellow out!
very cool spot, i loved the music and the ambiance. the bartender, justine, was awesome and treated us very well. she was also a talented bartender and made some fantastic drinks for us. i will absolutely be coming back! nicely done, classic jewel!
love the chill atmosphere. love the area its in, and was curious to try because.... i was downtown for life is beautiful, and im a first friday enthusiast, etc. i saw it when i was heading home... i decided to try it tonight with my boyfriend and family.. cool place... i highly recommend. bartender justine was awesome, killed the fitzgerald drink...tasty : i love light and refreshing drinks.
my mother is 89 years old and lives alone.  she suffers from dementia and has not been able to get around very well.. i wanted to have a caregiver to be there for her to make sure she has help with her meals, medication reminders and transportation to appointments.  i was really nervous about having someone who i did not know being with my mother but cerna has helped ease the stress and has provided such wonderful service for my mother.  the caregivers are so compassionate and has given me much peace of mind!
cerna is an amazing company to work with if you or your loved ones need any assistance in their home. all the caregivers provide excellent service and strive to do the best. very friendly and knowledgeable, i would recommend cerna to anyone who is looking for the best care out there.
i have been suffering from allergies for so long!!!!  thank goodness for this clinic....they do allergy testing and immunotherapy.  i have been on this for 2 years now and feel so much better!  if you suffer from allergies  please come and see francia at desert palm!
i see dr. chris here and he is just wonderful! he takes his time with the patient, discusses options and listens to what you want. he even recommended a non medical approach to help with my pain management. he is very thorough and very warm and welcoming. i will not go anywhere else!
nums!!! its really sad to see that simon restaurant is no longer, but this new burger bar is pretty darn good. the burn your face off is a great explanation of how your taste buds are going to be feeling. if you cant handle the heat, stay away from this burger .. my friend had the pull pork burger the smoke out?? something like that .. like anything with bbq sauce expect to get messy with this one ... finally the dr. pepper burger .. a pretty thick portobello mushroom paired with a burger and grilled onions .. my least favorite of the 3 choices that were had. the burger was just too sweet yes sweeter than the bbq burger. oh and you cant leave without trying dessert! def need to try their nutella shake .. okay i have more to say, but im getting hungry all over again .. i shouldve taken photos also .. next time!
nice daytime atmosphere overlooking the pool. the makeyourown salmon burger  angus burger were both delicious. i think 11.95 with a side. wowthe wonderful buttery salty pretzel 9.95 could be shared as an app for 46 peopleyum!
just discovered this delightful restaurant  it is adjacent to the pool on the 6th floor of palms place.  the food was delicious and our server, jennifer added to the positive experience.  loved the big pretzel, blue cheese burger and shake.  good, upscale, casual dining.
cafe 6 occupies the old spot of simons on the 6th floor of the palms place. floor to ceiling windows overlooking the pool give an easygoing and fun vibe to the place. little less quirky than simons... on the menu you will find a pretty straightforward but good assortment of burgers and sandwiches. we went for the fried pickles hard to screw up, but they were excellent and came with some great dipping sauces... and i am a sucker for sauces, huge  soft pretzel and burgers. the pretzel was insanely large.... maybe enough for a whole table to share for their entire meal...definitely hit the spot when combined with their well above average if slightly pricey beer selection. my last adventure: the burn your face off burger. yes, thats really what its called. the manager personally came out to warn me that if i wasnt in the mood for something very spicy, i should get the sauce on the side. i told them to bring it as is and keep the waters coming. as expected, this was freaking hot. not terribly over the top though. the habanero sauce and the roasted pepper on the burger gave it a sweet and spicy taste that made it not only bearable, but enjoyable. it did make me want to go stick my face in the pool though. all in all, simons was an enjoyable experience and i would recommend  hopefully you leave with your face intact as i was able to.
i forgot to check in here when i was in vegas but they have some good burgers. red robin and all those other burger places got nothing on cafe 6. i ordered the smoke out burger and my girlfriend ordered the sloppy joe one. she almost couldnt finish hers but i finished mine no problem. i had my burger with a side of onion rings and a 77. my girlfriend had hers with a side of fries and a sex on the beach. anyway, i would love to go back to vegas to eat here again.
i wish i had been invited by palms pr to come in like many of the other reviewers, but am very glad that my husband stumbled upon cafe 6 and put it on our list of places to try.  the restaurant setup itself is casual, fun to look around, and being surrounded by the pool makes it unique and more fun if you enjoy people watching.  all the staff were friendly and eager to make our experience a memorable one.the menu is fun  format is entertaining and the descriptions of each item were intriguing.  every item has a suggested beer pairing.  we started with the beer battered rock shrimp.  unless you are allergic to shellfish, you need to try this.  55the burgers are enormous and were cooked perfectly.  we ordered the smoke house and dr. peppershroom burgers with the waffle fries and onion rings.  each of these items rate a 55 on my list.  presentation was as fun as the menu, and we received adequate warning on how messy the smoke house would be.had to stop eating when christina mentioned dessert  she boxed up the rest of my burger and we ordered the nutella donuts, which came with a scoop of ice cream and 3 dipping sauces.  we actually ordered these to go, and there were brought out boxed up with a cute message on the container.  couldnt help ourselves though, and tried a couple before we left the table.  4.55oh, i also bypassed the beer for the vanilla bean milkshake im a sucker for shakes, and it was worth every sip!  555 stars  great food, great service, great location.  if i had to note the one but it would be that  our bill was a little hefty, but when we go out, we dont usually order as much food as we did on this visit.  couldnt help it, though  everything looked so good, and cafe 6 delivered.
this cafe is only 2 months old and i must say its starting off very strong.the service was great and she was extremely friendly. the scenevenue was nice. we sat along the window where on the other side lies a pool that kind of wraps around the restaurant. it was nice and i had a good view... giggidythe beer battered shrimp was awesome. it certainly had a kick but it was perfect. 55my wife had a vanilla bean and it was delicious. 55get her burger was good too, she ordered the dr pepper mushroom burger. she gave it a 55, it was more like a 45 to me.i had a smoke burger and that was da bomb. it was big, juicy and messy. 55we ordered nutella donuts to go. scrumptious! 45i love this place but i dont love the prices. and im really torn between a 4 or a 5 star. i wish i could give them a 4.25 out something. but since that burger was one of the best burgers ive had ill give them the benefit of the doubt.
loving cafe 6.  the pretzel is amazing!  they have a dr. pepper burger, with grilled onions, portobello mushrooms, and white cheddar that is absolutely delicious!
great service and great food. one of the best burgers i have ever tried and both me and my fiance loved it. we have been there twice now and enjoyed it both times. thats for sure is a good spot if you are a burger lover.
i was really impressed with this burger. im never real excited about the hotel restaurants but this was really good. the chef stephanie even came out to check on my meal. i will be back tomorrow
i cant believe i forgot to review his place.  i must have been in food coma.  ive been raving about it.  if you like a great dirty martini this place has got it. if you like comfort food this place takes it to another level. delicious.  lets break it down... soft pretzel: 55. a must!  soft buttery and salted with mustard and cheese dipping sauces to die for! yum!hot wings: 55 good in size. bigger that buffalo wild wings but then again that isnt saying much. we chose to have all the sauces on the side and enjoyed them all. chicken perfectly crisp. fried pickles: 4.55 love the dipping sauce and love how they were spears instead of the chips. u pick mini sliders:  55 great variety to chose from!  love trying something new and that i would never make at home. again i was not disappointed!  i did try the burn your face off chicken and loved it!  it had flavor, spice and heat!  perfect but hen again i love spicy things! the other two i chose where the turkey snack and toadstool swiss.  i would get those all again! deep fried oreos with ice cream: 55!!!! the best i have had!  perfectly fried with tasty sweet batter with soft oreo in the middle. chocolate and raspberry sauces for dipping. omg!!!!! heaven!  cant wait to go back!!!! service was great and food to die for.  comfort food at its best!
stopped in for appetizers. pretty limited options if youre staying at palms place. had an excellent server jennifer!!. pretty tasty, delicious chicken tenders. nice spot next to the pool, great atmosphere.
im not a burger person. i was skeptical about coming here... but i am a total fan. its located in palms place where the old simons use to be. we went on a sunday night... it wasnt busy... but it definitely should be! we were greeted immediately and sat a comfortable table. our server was an amazing young man from back east. dang, i wish i remembered his name... probably the best service ive had out in a long time. we ordered the pretzel as an app. actually... my boyfriend and his friend ordered it. it was huge! a total mealwithin itself and definitely not vegan... but appeared to be extremely enjoyable. i ordered a glass of wine and the virgin lettuce wraps... holy smokes!!! they were super flavorful... totally vegan... and absolutely delicious! score!! my boyfriend ordered 3 pork belly sliders and fries and our friend ordered the chicken caesar salad. everyone loved their food. of course... we left with left overs... but it was absolutely delicious. will i be returning? definitely!
great service and good food in a relaxed yet vintage urban environment.  the bar section offers one of the largest selections of international draft beers i have ever seen. great place to relax among yuppies and professionals after a long day at the office. happy hour here is great. i was served by sarahmaude, a nice blonde barmaid with an incredible smile that offers great service. definitely worth the detour for moderately priced food and drinks.
havent tried the food menu yet but the selection of beers is amazing! the service has always been great as well along with the atmosphere. it was very modern yet cozy. the tiramisu is worth getting so always save space, theyre fresh and home made every morning so its only while quantities last daily! ive been there just for the tiramisu a couple times after work. totally worth it
i am glad i discovered this place, we were passing by and decided to give it a chance. nice decor, welcoming stuff. we ordered for the kids and they did not like the tortellini the manager gladly offered us another kids menu option  by the way the tortellini they did not like was one of the best i tasted. we did our own pizza , great taste and amazing crust, the grilled octopus was very tender and cooked to perfection. caesar salad was tasty , made with fresh lettuce. really liked this place, highly recommend it. i will definitely come without the kids to try the bar section.
kat is amazing!! i have been seeing her for over 3 years and she still surprises me with how talented she is. every time i get my hair done, she transforms it into something i absolutely love. she is full of great ideas and always listens to my wants and needs when it comes to my hair. she knows all the latest styles and trends and can do basically anything when it comes to hair.. you will walk out of her salon lookin like a million bucks!!!
seriously the best! shes been doing my hair for quite awhile now and i always leave happy. shes amazing with color, too! i love how she does my ombre, she makes it look natural instead of choppy like some salons :
i love kat and her creative gel manicures. she does a wonderful job and my nails look great for three weeks! my new favorite product is the mood changer polish and people love to watch my nails magically change color right before their eyes! kat is also a fabulous hairdresser!
i used to spend so much time going from hairstylist to hairstylist.. not happy with what i was getting.. then i found kat. she has changed my life!!! not only does she know the latest and hottest trends, but she has the best personality!! her prices are fantastic... !! i have also seen what she can do with nails.. and wow!!
i have been getting my nails done by nicole for years now and they are seriously a work of art everytime! i bring a picture of an outfit i want to wear and she can match it perfectly! i bring a picture of other nails i find online and she does them even better! she is amazing in her work as well as a wonderful person! you will not find a better place to get beautiful nails!!
another great experience with kat! adorable haircut and the coolest turquoise nails!
nicole has been doing my nails for years! she has a whole wall full of glitter to choose from to make your nails sparkly and fun! love all the designs she does on my nails! ill come in with a nail design i found and she does exactly what i expect. i would recommend anyone to get their nails done with nicole!
kat is the best. she takes her time with each manicure and keeps your nails healthy. ive been going to kat since april 2014 because she is that good! her prices are great, she has a large selection of polish colors and she is super fun to be around. her new salon is super cute too.unfortunately i just had to move to washington, dc and i have not found anyone near as good as kat; its depressing. i miss her personality, attention to detail, and the overall amazing job she use to do on my nails! go to kat  you will love her!
bella is the best  my kids love to be here, play with her kids  sleep over sometimes. lot of fun and learning activities . the only place i can trust to take care my kids . we all loved her  her kids

professional salon haircut for half the price by a cool guy in a sweet venue. what more could you want? whatever it is, im sure lawrence can make it happen.
i have been trying to get a super cute pixie since february and no one could get it right  until lawrence! go to him, your hair will be amazing. my color rocks too!
lawrence is amazing. i have been going to him for several years now and my hair has never looked better! he has done a great job setting up his own little salon at his home and goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable. i would recommend him to anyone!
i love lawrence! i have been going to him for about 6 years now and i only trust him since hes very knowledgeable and makes me feel comfortable with any decision i make! i just chopped off 13 inches of hair and love the way he styled it! i get great compliments all the time! make sure for your next haircut you go and see lawrence! hes the best!
stop bouncing around from barbershop or salons and back. lawrence at evo is the one who gets it done. perfect haircuts every time, and they last until the next appointment. there is nothing worse than having a great haircut for a day, and then it never looks like it did when you leave the barbers chair. not the case here, you have a great cut until the next appointment. i cannot stress enough how pleased i am that i found evo and lawrence. lawrence has a great personality, and frankly that is really 90 of what youre looking for when someone is cutting your hair! he is officially my lifetime barber.
lawrence is simply amazing. i dont trust anyone with my hair. let alone a man. no offense.  but he reassured me and made my hair feel brand new. :  and hes a star wars nerd. so thats a plus. :
new einsteins. friendly staff. super efficient. free wi fi.great location with plenty of parking.
my husband and i came here last week for a couples massage. it was amazing! the spa itself is beautiful. they have someone to come and collect you after you check in so theres no wandering through doors wondering if youre in the right place. they get you set up with a locker that has slippers and a robe in it. it has loads of amenities if you need to get ready afterwards which is good. they have a quiet room where you wait for them to pick you up for a treatment. i used the jacuzzi and saw they had a steam room but didnt use that. they also had a salt cave which i didnt use but looked really nice. they brought us to meet our therapists at the treatment area and i met my husband in the couples room. they give you a choice of music including your own if you want and scented oils and extras if you want to add anything to the massage. i had a fusion massage and my husband had a deep tissue. both of us left feeling amazing. i cant remember our therapists names but i was really happy.  loved every minute of it!!!
luxury. amazing place: great facilities with supertalented and superfriend therapists.my massage was performed by a girl from ireland. i didnt even know ireland had massage therapists, but they clearly train them well!!if you need to have a few hours of relaxation in vegas and we all do, this is the place.
i got my wedding hair and makeup done by tabitha and was thoroughly impressed. she did an excellent job! the salon is very plush and nice. all the staff we came in contact with were friendly and very accommodating highly recommended especially for a bridal updo and makeup!
awesome experience!  got an 80 minute massage with holly with an eye treatment.  wonderful massage.  the facilities were top notch.  also spent 45 minutes in the salt cave. perfect way to end this day of luxury.  absolutely recommend this spa and holly.
highly recommed this gorgeous spa.  ive been to many spas in the country and have had hundreds of massages.  this was one of my best experiences yet.  i received an 80 minute massage from carlos with a foot scrub.  it was heavenly.  i followed that up with 45 minutes in the salt cave.  what a nice touch after the perfect massage.  after going to about a dozen of the spas on the las vegas strip, i would say that this spa was the best price and certainly one of the cleanest i have ever seen.  i cannot wait to return!
exceptional facilities and servicesbest deal in vegas!!!
beautiful facility!  salt room is amazing.  service is top notch.  staff anticipated our every need.  comfy robes!  will be back!
totally totally totally recommend this place! the service is great everytime. i recently got a very nice haircut by analisa. she definitely knew what she was doing.the atmosphere is very relaxing and it is very clean and neat. it was well worth every penny.
this review is for tabitha. i didnt get to use the facilities here, even though i had a manipedi which meant i spent enough to be able to use the spa. i was kind of rushed out. buttabitha and she was great: professional and fun! i had a very relaxing time and loved how my nails turned out. she shaped them perfectly and the paint was even and clean. i will totally go back to her!
the spa at the linq was excellent. very professional employees, curtious and nice. upon walking in everything was spotless, well kept. beautiful atmosphere, tranquil and lovely. my favorite area was the himalayan salt cave. your skin will be soft, your lungs will feel content. i love this spa, i was in heaven.
this review is for tom and the spa at the linq.  i rarely go to spas in general but this one is probably the best one ive been to.  very relaxing, has a good price, and the amenities are great.  i went for the salt room, which is supposed to have a detoxcleansing effect.  tom was very professional and what i appreciated most was the time he takes to explain the details of the facility. he never rushes you through anything is extremely punctual.  was there just this past thursday, on thanksgiving, and even though there was a lot of people around, the design of the place makes you feel as if youre the only one there.  i would definitely go back.
ive been here three times and i have loved every visit! tabitha has done my hair every single time and my make up once as well.  she is the best!  with my hair, shes done a blowout, updo, and curls.  i cant wait for my next visit.  tabitha makes me feel and look beautiful and she is one of my favorite things about vegas!
these guys rock! i left a pack with 4 cigs in the center console just to see if they would steal them based on my experience from other car washes. when i pulled up, they listened to what i wanted and didnt spend an hour trying to sell me something extra. the price including my seats shampooed was very reasonable.when my car was done, i was super curious to see if they stole from me. immediately, i see a 5 and an almost full pack of smokes sitting in a cup holder. of course, the 4 smokes i knew about were all there. this was a nice feeling to see how honest they really were since they could have taken these other items without me knowing it. i will be back to get my car washed. they do a better job than francis and sons by far!
they were fast even on a busy saturday morning. the car was meticulously polished and it was reasonably priced.
i go to chipotle at least twice a month. today i took my mom in for lunch, for her first chipotle experience! the food, as always, was great. the service however, is what will keep me coming back to this particular location. in all my years of going to chipotle, i have never had a reason to write a review until now! tom, was the cashier at the time and he was just the sweetest person. i dont think i have ever received such kindness, my mom was even impressed, and that says something. so, thank you tom  you made both of our days :

had a mobile oil change done today by a new pgh service !  it was awesome!  brian came to my home, timely, professional.  i enjoyed my morning coffee no rushing around , no waiting . i will never again spend my saturday on car chores!   this service rocks!
brian came and changed my oil while i was at work. he was very professional and efficient, and the service was extremely convenient! would definitely recommend to anyone needing work done who doesnt have time to go to a shop.
so i did a very stupid thing and accidentally topped off my oil with antifreeze it was dark! the containers are very similar!. i discovered yourmechanic while trying to figure out how to get my oil changed without starting the engine and driving somewhere. it was easy and convenient to make a nextday appointment online. i knew right up front what the cost would be and was delighted to find it was even bit cheaper than my usual mechanic. josh called to confirm and followup on my specific problem. he arrived right on time and was professional, friendly and efficient. he didnt try to upsell me on anything or talk down to me ladies, you know this feeling at the garage, amiright?. the whole thing took less than an hour and was basically like having a really competent gearhead friend whom you could ask to come fix things for you. it doesnt get any better than this!
rachael did an amazing job on my voluminous eyelash extensions. she explained everything i needed to know about eyelash extension care. she also took time to perfectly blend my natural eyelashes with the extensions. definitely would recommend her.
go to rachel for amazing lashes! i got the classic full set and they look very full and soft. i wanted a more natural look and she did just that! shes good at applying them and its really relaxing. all the lash care was explained to me before i left.
had a great experience! it was my first time getting eyelash extensions and she was great. im very happy with how my lashes came out. we first discussed what my goal was for the lashes and she only took about an hour. she played some light music in the background while i laid down. good conversation, as well. i look forward to seeing her again for fills!
carissa was amazing! i came in with dark brown hair, and in one sitting she was able to lighten my hair to a lightbrown and give me a natural ombre  bayalage. i would highly recommend her, she is professional and can give you great results!!:
carissa is a doll!!!! she is absolutely the best, you tell her what you are looking for and she exceeds your expectations especially without killing your hair with nasty products. she is always on time for events and very fun to be around. i highly recommend her.
just moved back to the valley and had to find a new stylist. carissa mott was exactly what i was looking for! she is awesome sauce and super quick! it normally takes stylists 3 hours to do my hair, carissa took about 2 which was great! i am super happy with  my bayalageombre color! she was well worth the drive from central phx!
my hair turned out better then i could have imagined! i went from dark brunette to blonde ombre. carissa lightened up my hair and it blended beautifully. i would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a change!
this was my first time here and i will definitely be back! the salon has a great atmosphere and everyone is so friendly. carissa was amazing and i absolutely love my hair!
first of all let me just say this: carissa is the best of the best. she really knows and understands what she is doing when it comes to all things hair. just go check out her instragram page: hair_motty and you will see pictures upon pictures of amazing hair transformations that she has done. they have all turned out wonderful and gorgeous!! i just went to carissa for a hair cut because my hair felt heavy, dead on the ends, and boring. i left feeling light and pretty! she did an incredible job with just a simple cut. she reblended my layers and made everything look fresh. i was apprehensive to get my hair colored because of the upkeep but she made some great recommendations of things we could do in the future that wouldnt be so costly and hard to manage. the salon is adorable and everyone is friendly. i would call the salon immediately to book an appointment with carissa!!
i have gone to different hairstylists and was never pleased. i went to carissa and she did an amazing job. i have not gone to anyone else since her. she always knows what i want and always exceeds my expectations.
yum, yum, yum!after the twitter feed reading of day 46, cheesecake watch, still not open, artisan cheesecakes have finally opened in bruntsfield as of wed. the good people of bruntsfield have been spoiled. within a couple of months, cuckoos and artisan cheesecakes both opened in bruntsfield place and being the cake fiend that i am, i hit up both in the same day. previously cafe grande had the monopoly on cheesecake but at a fiver for sitting in, it was an expensive treat.after sit in at cuckoos multitasking by working and having tea and cake, i popped into artisan to see what was on offer. i struck gold with not one but two types of gluten free cheesecake to choose from as i was informed by my cheery server. i appreciated having an option, never mind two as i had been preparing for disappointment with there being nothing available. tablet or millionaires, decisions, decisions! tablet won and it is delicious. a decent size piece was £3 to take away  topped with lovely chunks of tablet, a light but fairly solid based cheesecake, it is absolutely divine! the base for gf is a biggie as gf sometimes is overly crumbly but this all holds together very well. so, the shop  it is a small space, all creams and pastel shades with only a few seats but lots of fridge space full of cheesecake so takeaway may be the predominant option. to be honest, i wasnt paying attention as i was too busy deciding on the gf options but i believe there are around 16 options to choose from on a daily basis!! ill definitely be back soon and hoping to try a fruity gluten free option next time. well worth a visit! :
this part of bruntsfield has become sweet street; the chocolate tree, falko, la barantine, meadowberry, cuckoos bakery and now artisan cheesecake. i know where to go to get my pudding fix.i had relatively low expectations for artisan cheesecake. i foresaw overly sweet and sickly dense cakes which would leave me nauseous for several hours. being the apparent masochist that i am, i decided to come check this place out with a few friends for breakfast yesterday.there were about 10 cheesecakes on offer. i was torn between a the spicy pumpkin and turkish delight varieties, eventually opting for the former hoping it would be less sickly. my friends took the bounty and new york baked cheesecake. my cheesecake was surprisingly not too sweet, had a good amount of cinnamon and came with a side of whipped cream which i by and large avoided. i tried my boyfriends new york cheesecake which was also quite light and tasty.artisan cheesecakes make for the perfect breakfast when paired with an artisan roast coffee, available just up the street.
wow just wow. tablet cheesecake is the best thing that has ever happened go me. just go go go go go.
i dont consider myself much of a cheesecake fan. when my girlfriend gets one, i will steal a bite because i know its good, but i never order one for myself. that being said, i will be coming back here again and again and again. the chocolate coconut cheesecake was the highlight of my week. in addition, the employees were very friendly and happily helped us narrow down the massive selection of flavors.if you are not inside of, eating, or en route to artisan cheesecakes right now then you need to seriously rethink your priorities.
if you like cheesecake, this place is a must!with plenty of choice, i opted for the salted caramel.  deliciously creamy with a tasty biscuit base it was easily the best cheesecake ive had since i was last in boston.
i wasnt too sure about artisan cheesecakes... i popped in not long after their opening and had a good slice, but i didnt find anything mindblowingly amazing about the cheesecake and opted to wait until i braved bruntsfield again before penning a review.im very glad i did.because alisa and john r are magical social unicorn who are always on top of whats what in the foodie festival world, i found myself in bruntsfield last week on a mini christmas crawl. each little shopcafe in the neighbourhood was giving away mini samples. we stopped into artisan cheesecake for no more than 4 minutes but it was enough time for them to get a mango blueberry sample into my hands and folks: this is a mic dropping cheesecake. i had been thinking about it all week and actually planned a meeting around sneaking in to get a proper piece. it was the perfect balance of creamy cheesecake goodness, without being too rich or overwhelming. that little morsel of amazing, took a cheerful four star review to an energetic hat tip of a five star.
selling your families belongings can be exhausting and make you feel very vulnerable.  this company and patrick , the owner personally took many steps to make this such a better process for me.  you can get taken advantage of terribly if you are not dealing with good, honest people who care about getting you the most for your stuff.  i highly recommend this company over all of the ones in vegas. there is not a better option than mcmanus.  they are professional and very fair.  thank you patrick and staff for being the best at what you do.
fantastic auction house, patrick is a stand up guy. staff is very friendly. always a pleasant experience buying there. great atmosphere, really a first class operation all around.
honest and fair auction. they are very friendly and the customer service is first rate. i love coming here on sunday mornings.
this is the best auction in clark or nye county. really great items and it is a fun way to spend some time on a sunday morning. i like the coins and collectibles the best.
ambassador fine cigars stands in the valley as a cigar smokers resource. vartan seferian is the owner. you will be hard pressed to meet another person who cares more about his clientele, and their wants and needs, than him. simply put, this is the place to go when you are looking for the very best in what the cigar world offers noncuban. the new location on tatum is beautiful. the walkin humidor is enormous, the largest in arizona, i believe. and in the future there will be a davidoff lounge, a very rare thing, indeed... you owe it to yourself if you love cigars: go to ambassador on tatum, meet vartan and chat with him about cigars and life. your day will have improved, i promise.
what a precious find!  i stopped in for a birthday gift and the staff were fabulous. the gentleman was knowledgable and helpful as i am not schooled so to speak regarding cigars. i would definitely recommend and will be returning for my cigars 101.
what a fine place and what a fine outstanding gentleman vartan is, he really knows how to treat his clientele. the new store is beautiful and the humidor is very expansive, i cant wait to see the new lounge he is building.will be back, often!
so i went here for the football game. let me tell you  these girls were awesome. gina the manager was amazing! raquel our server was the best ever. she catered to all of our needs and was amazing! let me tell you angie was the best bartender she gave us the best service, best drinks! love this place!
ok the food here is not that great really but the atmosphere was really fun and the drinks were great! people were dancing including the staff. the music was great and up beat. the staff seemed to enjoy their job laughing and talking with everyone whether they were their customer or not. it was very fun and comfortable. our food came very timely despite all the activity, we were not neglected at all by our waiter who was very busy with other customers and entertaining at the bar. i would totally recommend this place for a fun couple shots and snacks.
old town atmosphere serving delicious chicken. what more could you ask for! will be eating here again for sure.
i have found nothing here that isnt 5 star.  the food is great, the staff is very courteous and fun, and a great atmosphere.  keep it up!
my husband and i stumbled upon this place today for lunch.  i had the 2 piece chicken with corn and green beans.  my husband had the catfish plate with fries and slaw.  it was so good!  my chicken was cooked and seasoned just right!  the sides were tasty and a great compliment to the meat.  my husband loved his as well.  he had to bring some home there was so much food.  i just want to add that the ladies working the front of house......were awesome!  they were so nice....made us feel right at home.  they laughed with us and made it a fun lunch.  i would definitely recommend this place.
this was a nice little surprise that we located in downtown mount holly. we went twice in one week. the staff is so friendly  seems to know everyone who walked in the door. on my first visit i got chicken and dumplings which were as good as my moms. i also got green beans  corn. the green beans are seasoned just right. every thing was delicious. we returned two days later, and i liked the green beans so much that i got them again along with the fried chicken and mashed potatoes with gravy. the chicken was delicious. i am a fan of bojangles chicken, but thought this was better. great place to get a meal.
this is my go to movie theater when i want to see a movie. okay maybe its the closest theater, that helps, but i wouldnt frequent here if it sucked. and since you can have dinner at one of the many restaurants then hit the theater is a definite plus. oh and after movie night caps can be cool too. this regal always has the best first run movies and in different choices of imax, imax 3d, or regular showing. i really dont have any complaints and as with any movie theater its up to you to get there early enough for a good seat and lets not even get started on the concession prices as its the same anywhere but free refills on large popcorn is pretty cool. red rock is the best dinner and a movie spot around.
always a huge selection of movies here. clean and spacious theaters. concession stand is bit pricey but the food tastes better than other typical movie places. they are a bit slow getting your order to you, so leave a little more time for that if you are trying to be on time for your show.
with all the years a have coming to this location ive never had a problem. i have never been to the tuesdays six dollar movie day, however, i hear from family members that they have had a wonderful time and berry expensive. i like the system that they have for when they have blockbuster. i have been to other movie theaters and their waiting time is ridiculous.  it makes it very convenient when they have multiple showings.
love the movie theater! i recently went for star wars in 3d and imax. they were very organized for the event and i was able to get into the theater with ease and without waiting.i have been to the movies were many times since living in vegas and havent had a bad experience yet. very clean and good customer service.
this place is close to our office and we go here often. we find good deals here often but you have to keep coming back to find the right deal that fits for you.
best. place. ever. fantastic service, people who know what theyre doing, and love what they do! live in the east valley? who cares!! make the drive! soooo worth it. the owner is amazing and hilarious, and youll walk out with a shiny, clean puppy and a great experience. seriously. go. now! ;
diane made a special appointment to get my elderly porch kitty in for her annual lion cut. it has been the best cut she has received thus far and we will be back!
awesome groomers!!!  the best place ive taken my dogs to be groomed!  diana is the best!!!! the best thing about mollys is they knew about and understood how to groom my dogs.  i am totally confident when i leave duece man and penny lane that they will be well taken care of.
i am new to arizona so i needed a new groomer.  i saw an advertisement in our local paper and took a chance.  from the minute i walked in i felt very welcomed.  i left my dog there for grooming and returned to catalina with a fabulous haircut!  i am so happy that i opened that magazine....otherwise i probably would not have found this place since it is not very close to my home.  we will definitely be back...loved the customer service, the owner, her workers were amazing.  catalina was definitely pampered and it didnt cost a lot of money.  great place...worth the drive.
i will definitely be bringing my dogs backhere, my appointment was at 2 oclock i showed up at 1:15, diane told me that would be no problem they got me right in, that they did with no questions asked. we now have a new place to get our dogs groomed! i am very pleased with their work! thanks frank
i finally found a groomer that i like!  very friendly staff and very reasonable prices. my little maltipoo looked so pretty and smelled so good for days. i will be going back for sure.
this was the best hour you can treat yourself to.  i have never had a reflexology massage before this was fabulous. the atmosphere is cool calm with soothing.  exactly what you need today.
i am very specific about my massage. i like a deep tissue and a firm massage. peter at sunshine relaxation has given me the best massage that ive been looking forward from a long dreading work week. he is very strong, very experienced, and very professional. my first time going to this place. the place is very clean and very relaxing. mynga the manager there was helpful and friendly. this is my go to massage from now on. i left with a happy face and i will definitely come back here again. thank you peter and sunshine relaxation.
when you think of a massage, you think itll be relaxing right!?!?  my massage was not relaxing as you would think, but this was by far the best massage i ever received!! let me elaborate, it wasnt relaxing because i have so much tension, knots and stress going on that i never thought i had. leo kept making sure i was comfortable, haha. so, the following day. i felt so good!!! i highly recommend sunshine relaxation.the ambiance and decor is  nice here.. the owner was very welcoming. therefore, i will come back!
today was my first time at sunshine relaxation and right when i walked in, it felt really welcoming. the decor and atmosphere was very calming and soothing, and not to mention clean! my masseuse was a female and she was very concerning on my tension points and she focused nicely on my stress areas. i would recommend them if you are looking for a good and affordable place to relax and unwind.
this was the best reflexology massage i have ever had! i have been to probably 6 other places in the valley and this place tops them all. vary relaxing. i suggest anyone looking to get a massage try this place. you will be glad u did.
my mom love this place a lot. i gave my mom a foot reflexology gift card. she said her feet too much better. now. i happy can to get the rigth gift for mom.
my wife and i took an hour out of our busy schedules to get a massage. everything was great. i am so relaxed i need a nap
being a broke college student who needed a  reliable car, coming to good carma was the best decision i ever made! martin was a very great help, he was very knowledgable and never pressured me into buying something i didnt want. i now drive a 2011 nissan versa, and couldnt be any happier. big thank you to good carma and the employees! :
i just recently bought a car from good carmaand have never been happier with a purchase. i believe my salesmens name was martin. he was very knowledgeable about his inventory and was able to find me the best car for the money i was willing to spend. he also helped me find the best possible place to finance my car. the staff at good carma is extremely kind and i would highly recommend this business to anybody looking for a good used car!
i had recently purchased a 2000 jeep grand laredo from good carma for my 16 year old daughter and i cant say enough great things about these guys.  martin was very patient with us because my daughter saved enough money to buy her first car and when the car she wanted didnt match her budget, martin helped us and gave us options, under no pressure what so ever along with being very honest.  this is a used car sales company like no other where they will work with you under no pressure and take the time to see what best car would fit your needs with honesty and integrity.  i had asked to also have a broken side mirror replaced and with no questions asked, told us he would have that replaced.  i highly recommend good carma who is looking for a used vehicle and dont want to deal with the large dealerships and the pressure to buy.  thank you martin and adrian for all your help and going above and beyond in your customer service!!
drove in from los angeles to buy my motherinlaw a car.  the entire experience was quick and painless...exactly what i was hoping for.
got refered here from a friend. looked on line and checked out their inventory.  found 3 vehicles that interested me.  did my research the night before.  called that morning to make sure the vehicles i was interested in were available.  went in, nice sized lot,  office clean and welcoming.  staff welcoming and helpful.  martin was great no pressure and no hassling.  test drove the one i wanted and worked out the details.  next day found that the air conditioning needed to be recharged told me bring it back and fixed it no problem. very enjoyable experience.
kharma and carma  good stuff.  brought a friend to this place, referred and now preferred.  martin was a busy guy, but friend left the place happy.  they lived up to their promise to finish minor repairs, even offered to wash it.  need a car?  go here.  want a car they dont have on the lot and if you have the time, theyll get it for you.  they take credit cards  just plan on adding 3  its only fair.   cash talks.....
i recently bought a car from martin, he was so accommodating and came in on labor day for me. the car ended up with a small issue and martin was on it and i got my car back within 2 days and its running beautifully. ill definitely do business with him again!
i bought car hear early september from rama  kusnadi i had also purchased insurance that he recommended. to make long story short had a leak from cv boot and had transmission problems. like any used car its expected. i talked to rama about it he is taking care of it for me. he also is gonna let me use a loner car he has been very helpful i recommend this place to everyone. make sure you ask for rama kusnadi hes straight up he dont bullshit you or give you the runaround he will take care of you
i must say after all the years of buying a car these guys really worked with me thank you martin for being so professional and being honest and helping me with my situation i will refer all the people i know that are in need of a car you guys are one classy bunch of guys and girl lol seriously thank you for all your help joy
tres gros et delicieux sandwich au poulet je vais y retourner certains.endroit tres accueillant propre tres courtois
chelsea is amazing! she takes her time with you. my lashes are always on point because of her. the lash retention is great and she educates you on how to take care of them. it is a super comfortable environment too! once you get fabulashed you will become addicted! chelsea is also amazing with skincare! i have battled melasma for years after my pregnancy and she was able to help get my skin glowing again! i have been to many dermatologists and they never did anything for my skin except charge me a lot and try to get me to buy their expensive products. chelsea new exactly how to help with my problem area! go see chelsea! you will not be disappointed! tell her heather t. sent you :
chelsey with fabulash skin studio is the best lash artist! my lashes look amazing and full for a full 34 weeks. her product and lashes are the best on the market. chelsey is constantly learning about new products and is constantly educating herself on the best techniques and ways to enhance your lashes. being asian it is really hard to find someone that understands my eye shape along with my lash issues that i have. with chelseys she knew exactly what would work, look and last the longest. i would never trust my lashes to anyone else! she is the one to seek out to have amazing results!!
chelsey is an amazing and talented lash artist! i moved to phoenix two years ago from salt lake and have been doing my lashes for 6 years now so i am very selective about who i go to. before i found fabulash, i had gone to 5 other artists across the valley that i wasnt very satisfied with due to retention and i wanted volume lashes so i was thankful to find chelsey! she uses the same products borboleta that my lash artist uses in utah and i absolutely love their products!!chelsey takes her time and makes sure that you love your lashes before you leave the studio. its a very comfortable and relaxing environment. what i love most is that her schedule is pretty flexible. being that i am on a 9:306pm mf schedule, fabulash is open on the weekends so i dont have to rush there after work to get lashed! going to other places previously, they didnt have the flexibility that she offers. i would definitely recommend chelsey for beautiful volume lashes! she is always staying up to date with the latest techniques and uses the best products out there! my lashes have a great retention of up to 34 weeks. her prices are also very affordable! if you want someone who truly cares about her clients, go to chelsey!!
it opened today and not dissapointed!  you get what you pay for, they dont skimp on the meat great selection of toppings. set up like chipotle but better menu and selection of meals. carne asada great flavor, a little grissle. friend had the carnitas, she really liked it. stated they were more authentic then chipotle. ill be coming back to try rest of menu!
first time trying chronic tacos and i loved it. i had the carne asada torta, and it was great! the meat was well cooked and the bread was great too, it didnt get all soggy like some tortas do. next time ill try their burritos and see how that goes..
omg so i 1st tried it in california near redondo beach...i must say im a true cali girl but this place in phoenix is the best i got a huge salad with chicken and lots of toppings no extra charge! my son got a carnitas taco very nice not greasy it was crispy just the way they are supposed to be ,salsa was very authentic and spicy. i highly recommend chronic tacos. chipotle has nothing on these guys this is authentic mexican cool style food!!! the staff is awesome and very busy. love it!
i thought the food was good. just was kind of hard to get because the gal behind the counter had a tongue piercing and couldnt really hear me? but all that set a side, the carnage asada ruled! chronic tacos! chronic tacos!chronic tacos!chronic tacos!chronic tacos!chronic tacos!chronic tacos!
good food. great alternative to chipotle. price vs portions are resonable. line was resonable, but i was in at a slower time.did ask the manager about some of the reviews saying the lines are bad. they are aware of the issue and are looking to change some things.
gosh it was amazing this place is so wonderful i love everything about it  also the customer service was amazing the young ladys were very energetic outgoing and polite the cashier brenda shes a sweetie she made sure i was satisfied with my meal and made sure i left with a smile on my face was haveing a bad day until   i met miss brenda i wanna give them a five star and again thank you brenda:
im gonna say this place is 5 star. been here 3 times since they opened and its definitely on my list to keep coming back. love the baja style fish and shrimp tacos! beer battered is delicious, takes a little longer, just a few minutes, but worth the wait. steak and chicken tacos also on point. everything is fresh and you have so many options! owner is on site and super nice hard working guy. you can see his staff respects and likes him. reading some of the other reviews i think people are being too harsh, when a restaurant opens it takes a little time for the crew to be performing as a team. instead of writing a bad review talk to the manager and let them correct their problem. revisit the establishment and then write your review! i hate to see such a great place getting negative reviews when they just needed some time to learn and start functioning smoothly! good job chronic staff and owner!
great food, great service.  my husband and i were greeted as soon as we walked through the door.  we were asked if we had ever been which we replied no.  we got a very  ice explanation of the menu and how it works.  my husband got the carnitas burrito and i opted for the carnitas bowl.  the toppings were awesome.  all of the food was fresh and delicious.   the beer on tap perfectly compliments the food.  we will be coming back for more, it was quite simply delicious.
this place is our go to spot for taco tuesday! the food is always fresh and delicious and the staff is very helpful and attentive! i would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for quality food at a super affordable price.
good food.  had a carne asada burrito and it was delicious. will definitely be a regular.
i see a lot of places comparing chronic tacos to chipotle. chronic tacos franchise have been around longer than chipotle. maybe not here, but in california. that being said, we walked in and were greeted immediately. the lady was busy and another employee came out of the back within a minute. we had not been to this restaurant before and they helped us with each step. the staff was extremely friendly and nice. it will be a place that we will revisit and i encourage everyone to visit, even if your first experience was less than perfect.
bomb.govlove all their food so far. tacos are so good. rice and beans kill it. carne asada, pastor...delicioso!
the owner, brad, is great!! kept making suggestions to better my experience there. food is good too! the first time i went they were a little slow but seems as if theyve picked it up and are starting get people through the line quicker. overall, i was pleased!
i see lots of complaints about the service and food. never had it happen to us. we drive from tempe to eat there. yes there is chipotle but ct is different and has not been killed by mcdonalds owning it. if you want burrito the size of your forearm or some great tacos at a great price this is it!
my husband and i tried chronic tacos located on w peoria ave shortly after they opened. i know this review is long overdue but better late than never. the tacos i ordered were fish and my husband had beef. they were really tasty, hot and delicious. the seasonings on both the fish and beef were really tasty. the owner came by our table and checked on us to make sure everything was ok. he was friendly and personable. the tortilla chips were crispy and the salsa was yummy with nice chunks of tomato and onion.i would recommended this location for anyone looking for fresh, quality mexican food.
i will recommend anyone to this place. their burritos are amazing and all of the food is nice and fresh.  all staff are very nice and welcoming. they give you time to order and know what they are talking about. try it out for yourself! chronic tacos, its not filibertos.
came back tonight and got the tuna! sooooo good! clean, friendly and faster service this time. giving them 5 stars cause now well be regulars. plus im so happy that jersey mikes is giving maricopa a chance because we need so much more in this city.
had a great experience at this location yesterday. i was on business in maricopa and visited twice in one day i know, i need to cook more. both visits were awesome! this jersey mikes was busy, but the efficiency of the management and employees made both trips super smooth and pleasant.during my last visit around 4pm, one of the employees shelbie, the manager i think? kept all the customers engaged and smiling with small talk about the weather, current events, etc. its refreshing to be treated as a real person, rather than just another order while youre standing in line. thats great customer service!i recommend this jersey mikes to everyone who appreciates great customer service, engaging employees, and smiling faces. five stars!
i love this place!! great subs and understandable service they opened for a couple weeks now but people expect them to be just like a subway or jimmy johns... does it occur to people that subway doesnt have that big of a line from the photos seen. look closely in the back and notice the grill not a microwave. jersey mikes is the best and the entire staff seems to know what their doing and getting in the limbo of things lets just say im going to be a regular!!
ive been to many jersey mikes in the valley and the one in maricopa is exceptional. the food is always perfect and the staff is amazing.  david went above and beyond to make sure i was happy with my meal.
victor made me the best sandwich  provided great customer service. thank you so much!
so glad this awesome sub placed came to maricopa!! we love our subs mikes way! the staff has been top notch even during the grand opening. thats quite an accomplishment for a new establishment. keep up the good work.
i just got to say this place is great victor is a sub specialist lol the way they prepare it is awesome the customer service is always very helpful and nice for lunch or dinner this place is great youre looking for a sub sandwich dont waste your time going to subway stop at jersey mikes
this by far has been the best obgyn ive ever been to! from the healow app that notifies me about my appointments to my results, this office has been great! the staff is warm and dr. mchale is extremely wonderful at what she does and is incredibly thorough and walks you through what is going on.
amazing company. i have transformed my self and life with their guidance! matt is extremely knowledgeable in the personal training field and he has the degree to back it up. they actually teach you to not be afraid of food too! body solutions is more than just a personal training company it is a lifestyle making company!  i am proud to be on their team! teambodysolutions killitkillit
amazing training program! the facility is top notch and clean.  matt is very knowledgeable and experienced in helping you achieve your fitness goals.  i highly recommend body solutions if you want to take your fitness  nutrition to another level!!
so....i am 63, overweight, and have been intermittently physically active as an adult.  i hired body solutions about a year ago in order to motivate me to get more active again.  my plan was to stay with them for a month or two and then go out my own.  i am still with them.  you probably wonder why.  well, it is because they turned me into a jock who has a better undetstanding about nutrition and perserverence.  i am no longer morbidly obese and i love flexing the muscles in my forearm!!!  matt and becky have protected me from the injuries i normally experience while exercising.  their combined knowledge has taken me further than any other trainer i have hired in the past.  i am  a heathier 63 year old jock thanks to body solutions.  i recommend them without any reservation.
i found matt through thumbtack. i was trying to lose weight and didnt have any direction. after training for over 6 months with matt. i weighed 226lbs and now weigh 192lbs. i lost 34lbs and feel great. i now love to be more active with fitness and keep my training sessions twice a week. i highly recommend matt and becky for your weight loss goals and nutritional needs to have a life changing experience. if it wasnt for body solutions matt and becky. i wouldnt have lost any weight and would be at the same over weight place, i was before with no guidance or direction. they are truly amazing people and would recommend anyone to them. i thank them for all the support and guidance i have received and will continue with my fitness and weight loss needs with them. most professional and awesome trainers you could ever meet. they are flexible and understanding of your needs. thank you so much!
matt has been extremely wonderful to me in every way since i started working out with him! i have been working out with matt since january and the improvements i have seen this far have been amazing! he knowledge in nutrition and fitness is endless. since i started working with him, i have noticed results very quickly. ive never trained with a trainer before and he has made the training fun while also being motivational. i would recommend him to everyone! i couldnt thank him enough for helping me live better lifestyle.
ive been training with matt for about 7 months,  its been an amazing experience. i go 4 days a week. his workouts are challenging,  he changes them so you dont get bored with the same old routine. he doesnt waste time while were in the gym. i especially appreciate his knowledge of nutrition  his emphasis on flexible dieting. its awakened my awareness of healthy eating, forces me to be accountable,  is easy enough to follow. i credit his program  training for helping me drop over 80 lbs. highly recommend him!
my wife and i have been training with them for almost a year now. we are incredibly happy with their work to reach my fitness goals while helping to reduce my wifes physical limitations due to illness. they are consistent, reliable and very motivating.
i was referred from a friend who had recently lost 50lbs. i needed to lose 50lbs myself. i initially started with a nutrition plan and 1 workout per week. now i am training 2 times per week with matt, plus 2 times per week on my own. i am down 25lbs and loving the way i feel!
my husband and i have been working on our weight loss and nutrition with matt for about 3 12 months and have been very successful. i have never worked with a personal trainerdietician before and i was pretty nervous i would be pushed to make unrealistic changes to my diet or kill myself every day in the gym to be successful in my weight loss journey. but this experience has been quite the opposite. i was so happy to learn that the changes matt made to my diet were not difficult to stick with and they are turning into a big positive life change that i am confident will help me stay healthy for the rest of my life! and i actually look forward to our workout sessions because at the end i feel like i am accomplishing my goals and it makes me feel great! i have every confidence in matt to lead me to success because he is extremely educated in his field, easy to talk to and fun to work with. i would recommend him to all my family and friends!
ive been training with becky for about a year now.  i cant say enough great things about this trainer. i am seeing result and so are the people in my life.  becky is very knowledgeable and dedicated to my fitness results.  i would recommend her to anyone that is looking to change their lifestyle and fitness level!
sam was our waitressbartender. great service.  my wife had a green chili pork thing. she doesnt like hot food, but this was so good that she ate just about all of it. my pastor and fish tacos were the bomb.
great little spot with friendly staff and chill vibe! go. here. nothing better than supporting your local spots. solid salsa, tasty margs and tacos are bombdiggity! ask for rebecca or renee
ive never been to a place with a friendlier staff! everyone was attentive, kind and happy! they brought games to our table while we waited for our food...i mean, how cool?!? my kids played connect four while my wife and i played jenga. the salsa is ridiculously good. the food was on point!  a must eat! the gm, renee, was extremely kind and her team is behind her 100, so please go pay them a visit and try the avocado salsa. enjoy.
what a great surprise to find that the horrible pizza place has turned into a fantastic little mexican restaurant! this place has excellent service and todiefor street tacos! pretty good selection of beers on tap as well as what ever mix drinks you could ever want. another great thing for me was the jalapeno avocado salsa. ¡delicioso!
awesome place!!! food is cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the service we received from sam and kelton was personable and flawless! came in on a friday night for karaoke and dex rocked the house! would recommend this to anyone looking for a new place to try in north phoenix. will definitely be back soon!
service like you have never seen  margaritas off the chain!  the kids like the creamcicle shake thingy.  i had my wifes delicious homade quesadillas for a late lunch so i made the mistake of going full on mexican food already.  the chips come seasoned with a chili p thing  2 salsas.  the trick is to mix the salsas.  not bad!   we got nachos  i wasnt feeling them   now probably over full from chips  salsa. i got the street tacos  listen... the veggie fixins and mini tortillas very cool were fresh, but the carne was too peppery for my tastes  overcooked like the rice albeit tender  not fatty.  i tried my wifes carnita tacos  it they were excelent!my advice is double up on margaritas and get the carnitas! definately coming back on kareoke night!! :d
excited for this new mexican neighborhood bar and restaurant!   i really hope people discover them. its a great thing for the area.  fast and personal service!! great food and salsa.
delicious food!  chips and salsa for starters, chips have extra spice on them.  2 for 3 tacos were delicious, lots of choices for meats. bartender kelton seated us and served us right away, super friendly the whole time. house margarita is great, only tried it blended but great taste.  well be going back soon and taking all our friends with us.
so i havent had the time to go into this new bar mexican food joint! but my long term friend told me about the place, he currently is new chef and believe me when i tell you, this place well start booming in just a few weeks with him there, hes a young chubby guy full of ideas and tasty food knowledge, hes the reason why my place was a success, i had way to much things on my menu and my food expenses were threw the roof, i brought him in and he shorten my menu with foods that would sale, and foods that will help me sale more drinks at my bar, his food presentation are straight beautiful he gave my customers the idea that they were in a upscale restaurant not in a small family owned!  his belief is you eat from your eyes aswel as your mouth, so the food has to look tasty try this place out guys you will not be disappointed! and if you have already gave up on this place give it one more shot, ask for chef carlos aka chef charlie r! if your last visit wasnt all that great let him know and believe be he will do everything in his power to make this visit worth it! tell him johnny sent you.
amazing asada tacos!!  order the super hot salsa it will satisfy your need for spicy! fun place and good food!
stopped by to grab a quick post work drink and hopefully coming across some gluten free food.  come to find out, the bartender makes her own tasty margarita mix and the chef knows what its like to live with someone with celiac disease.  he prepped the grill and steered me away from anything thats so much as seasoned with gluten, even double checked seasoning ingredients!!!   boom!!!!this place is a celiacs gift!!!   great for nonceliacs, too!!
great drinks very friendly people good food. i recommend this place. great happy hour too
you gotta try, you wont want to go anywhere else. if you want great service, tacos or burritos that are monstrous, and a great happy hour come here! i like it because its family centric yet happy hour all weekend! see tess or ed and you wont regret it. stop in and let me know what you think
so glad i found this place. carnitas tacos and a few cold beers and you cant go wrong.  wonderful staff and killer food.  my new favorite place.  stop in  you will not be sorry.
you will not be disappointed. very good food. good staff. glad to have them back in the neighborhood.
the neighborhood staple is back in the neighborhood!  count me in for a 9 red, maybe fajitas, a chile relleno, or an excellent taco salad!  there isnt a dish you can go wrong with here.
glad its back! they a generous with the portions, the service and food is great and fast and they are reasonable and we have been eating there for 10 years. they still offer the 10 senior discount a big help to those on a fixed income. ordered the 9 shredded beef taco, green chili burrito and tostada. was excellent as usual. tried the special of the day the fry bread with green chili. was not happy, the fried bread tasted like burned oil and the green chili pork was not good. i ordered extra cheese didnt see any of that on it either. i contacted them and it was handled professionally, so we will be back. weird note, they wanted me to bring the fried bread back in, i asked if that couldnt be excused so i wouldnt have to get redressed and drive back there. it was! if we would have eaten in, there wouldnt have been such confusion. they have to protect themselves from fraud, and i understand as a former food service employee it does happen. cudos to jerrie sp or gerrie sp for handling the situation professionally.lastly i ordered the shredded chicken chimichanga: fundito style with extra jalapeno cream cheese on top. delish as usual l!!!everything was special order, and it was all present and accounted for! a rarity anywhere today! superior way to do things right. anyone who special orders knows the hell we usually deal with. never a problem or attitude from the staff. thanks again hal o penos for being our favorite neighborhood mexican restaurant. much rather help them the a berto 5 stars for deliciousness, prices, attention to detail, portions size and the excellent customer service.see you next week!
just had lunch there and if you want mexican food on the west side, this is it!!  great lunch special and their salsa is wow, the best.  i recommend it as a top of the list for the best mexican food.  yum
our favorite mexican restaurant!new convenient location. we are long time customers who have followed them to new locations. love the chicken fajaitas with onions and peppers served on a cast iron griddle,  piping hot! salsa and tortillas are very good. enjoy all the dishes weve tried. our goto restaurant where we are always satisfied!
man chasing theses guys all the time hopfulley they stay hare for for a long time because there food is always on point and they are going to start serving beer finley check them out and get there special hot sauce dont know the name of it but its the best ever
yay! a second first review because yelp deleted the one from the first day they were open when we ate here because it lacks a firsthand customer experience. i guess my description and photos of the meal somehow arent good enough. would the credit card receipt somehow prove it?heres why this place is authentic new mexican food:1. the owners and kitchen staff are from albuquerque.2. she is a fellow hatchhead. if its not from hatch, new mexico, then its not chile.3. christmas style aint just for december4. the enchiladas are topped with a fried egg...by default.5. very friendly and invited us to the soft opening if we dont mind a few inevitable glitches while we get things figured out. we dined there on their opening night and found the food to be wonderful, authentic new mexican cuisine. the owners are very friendly. the shop also has some items that i havent seen available in las vegas.my original review was much more detailed, but recreating that content for a site that doesnt bother to actually read before deleting them is not something i care to do right now.
came here for lunch.... great service..... the food was really good... get the fried ice cream! so delicious. the restaurant is really well done inside.
i had to splurge today....had the taco platter three soft or crunchy your choice of meat i had two with beef and one carne adovada pork marinated in red chile and slow roasted creamy refried beans and moist spanish rice. the salsa had a kick that was perfect on everything. paul sat me as soon as i walked in and provide good suggestions and great service. owners paul and.amy.came over to say hello and jewels.had a great smile for.me on the way out. i.will definitely be back. they serve only certified hatch chile.
i love family owned restaurants!!! why? 1 because the owners are usually there and they truly care about your dining experience! 2 the food makes you feel like your eating an amazing sunday dinner at home with your family 3 its not like every other corp mexican food joint. chile addiction even the name is cool lol this place rocks!!! try it!!!!
just had dinner there tonight.  the chili verde was just like i used to get in new mexico.  sat and talked with the owner and the wait staff and found them all to be very friendly and genuine.  nice to find a place in vegas that has all the favorites from new mexico
love the food ! great atmosphere ! best place to have breakfast, lunch and dinner ! had the chimichanga today and it was amazing !
my family and i were blown away by chile addiction. not only was the food fantastic and the service warm and friendly, but when sopapillas were left out of our to go order by accident, they apologized up one side and down another then offered to have them delivered to our front door! talk about incredible customer service!we ordered stuffed sopapillas, chicken enchiladas, a beef taco and the green chile burger i dont remember the super clever names, but loved reading through the menu! and everything was delicious! we cant wait to dine in next time... as everything is always better in the restaurant.
when you walk into this restaurant you think youre dining in old town in albuquerque new mexico. the decor looks fabulous from navajo rugs to kachina dolls and indian pottery. i had very high hopes that the food would be great and i was not disappointed. the red and green chili taste just like home as if your mother made it in her kitchen. the portions and the prices are right on point. if you enjoy authentic new mexican cuisine this is the place to be. you will not be disappointed.
now this is new mexico flavors....even the friendly service is authentic. great job bringing us home here in las vegas.
my family and i stumbled upon this new restaurant this weekend, we werent able to make it in then so we decided to stop in today. im from new mexico and am always wanting new mexican food, this was as authentic as it could be. the food was prepared to a t, great customer service, very friendly staff. we will definitely be back.
i grew up in las cruces and albuquerque, new mexico. my grandmothers cooking is very difficult to beat!! chile addiction was pretty close to my grandmothers authentic new mexico cooking. my wife and i drove in from california on our way to a weeks vacation just to try some new mexico cooking!! i had the stuffed sopapilla smothered in red chile. it was really good. it was also a lot of food!! i took half of it home and had it for dinner the next night. you have to try the chile con queso appetizer. it was excellent. my wife had a green chile enchilada, complete with an egg on top. she loved it!! we finished off our dinner with a basket of sopapilllas. my wife loves honey on hers, i like mine plain. yummy!!! 8 days later on our way home from vacation, we stopped in for our second meal. i had the stacked red chile enchiladas, complete with the egg on top. wow!!! it was just as good as grandmas!! my wife had the stuffed sopapilla smothered in red chile. she loved it!! we also had the chile con queso again as an appetizer. it was just as good as it was the first time we had it. we left the restaurant stuffed!!!! however,we took some extra sopapillas with us!! i highly recommend chile addiction and we are now loyal customers, even though it is a four hour drive from our home. we will come in each time we come to vegas!!! the owners, amy and paul, are very nice people. they are very concerned their customers are happy. we are happy!!oh yeah, i almost forgot. our waiter, robert, worked very hard making sure we had everything we needed throughout our meals. he was very patient while we were ordering there were so many great things to eat on the menu, we were having issues deciding what we wanted. he was our server on our second visit too. great owners, great staff, and great food. it has everything to make our new mexico experience, away from new mexico, authentic and delicious!!
this was my first time eating here after ive seen a suggested post about it on facebook i decided to try it out. i work graveyard so ordered to go so i can eat it at home before i head off to work. i ordered the pick 3 combo i decided to pick 2 stuffed ground beef sopaipillas and 1 rolled chicken enchilada with green sauce on all of it. the food is amazing this was my first time trying sopaipillas the meat is very tender i would definitely order this again without a question. the chicken enchilada was very good most places have a tough time keeping the chicken moist and not dying it out but they nailed it. all in all i will order from them again.
fantastic! new mexico style food!!!  great decor and nice staff. make it a point to try. flavors were great on everything ordered. tri color chips could be changed to mono or blue for my taste aesthetics but im knit picking lol.
woohoo!  havent wrote a review in awhile but i needed to after eating at chile addiction!  everything i ate was packed with lots of flavor. my favorite dish is the chile relleno topped w hatch green chile!  the sopaipillas were fluffy  had a nice crispness to it.  they also had excellent customer service!  i love supporting locally own family businesses and will definitely be back again!support your locals!  eat local!
if you like mexicansouthwestern food you need to try this place. it is the best mex. in las vegas. i had the intervention tostada with red new mexican chile sauce, carne avodova shredded beef, cheese sauce, and toppings. it was simply awesome. portion was large, everything was fresh. my wife had the tamales. those were awesome too! they have a tamale specialist chef come in and make them from scratch.i will be back, often.
ok so my first time have new mexican food and i have to admit, i am a huge fan! i got the nachos, guac, christmas style enchiladas and churros. everything was amazing!! however be ready for some heat because the food is spicy, but if youve read my reviews you know i love it. other than the food, the service was great. everyone from our amazing waitress amy, to the owner, to even the other guests gave off a really warm feeling. it felt like we were in their home being cooked for. we will definitely be back!
a really really good place to come and eat!! everything we decided to order and try was amazing and reasonably priced as well!! i will definitely be a regular here!!
chile rellenos , christmas style were delicious, as were the calabacitas ! endless coca cola  on point ! very friendly service , i love the video of alb balloon festival! i love the sopapillas and honey they serve with your meal , too! well be back for sure !
food was delicious!  by far best authentic mexican food in vegas...service was excellent!!  friendly owners....
just opened in beginning of june and hope they stay open for a long time. fresh tasting new mexican mexican food. we had the burrito with both redgreen sauces christmas style and a very healthy chicken salad. there are freebies too...house made chips with very tasty salsa and a soft slightly buttery bread that tastes great with honey. prices are very reasonable and our server was a very friendly dude. highly recommended!
my family is originally from new mexico, so i grew up on stacked enchiladas, sopaipillas and posole. when i heard chile addiction had opened in the southwest side of town, i was so excited to give them a try. i was thoroughly impressed by the food and the service. so impressed, that we ended up coming back not once, but two more times.i have tried the stacked enchiladas with pork verde, posole, stuffed enchiladas with pork verde, chile adovado, huevos rancheros, sopaipillas, tamales, breakfast burrito, churros and fried ice cream. every single thing i have tried has been great and definitely has that nostalgia factor going for it.the service here is beyond wonderful. the servers and owners are so friendly and welcoming and make sure refills are plentiful. theyve even offered us free dessert as an apology for our food taking too long. the funny thing is we didnt even notice a delay, but they insisted that we order dessert on them.i plan on making this a regular spot and i hope others take the time to experience this regional cuisine that holds a special place in my heart. just skip the desserts as they are not good.
this place is just like home! new mexico authentic! service was great and its very welcoming. i will definitely be coming back. i ordered the chimichanga with carne asada, beans, and cheese. smothered in red homemade chili sauce. refried beans and rice. thank you guys!
so my company informed us of this little gem. the food was so flavorful. the decor was very cute. the service outstanding. had rick as our waiter and he made sure we were well taken care of. i had the tamales, my dad had the chile reno and my step mom had the chimichanga. my step mom is one of the pickiest eaters ever and she walked out saying it was so good and cant wait to come back. my dad is real picky about his beans, he chose the pinto and said they were the best he has ever eaten in a restaurant. the tamales were packed with the red chile pork. everything was so delicious. they are working on their alcohol license but it did not matter once we tasted the food. it was hot, fresh and did not take long at all to come to the table.its a little tucked away in the corner but worth the search. im hoping they will be around for a long time and become very successful. you have to try this new mexico food it is worth it!
love the menu, food is delicious and authentic! great pricing too. it just opened and we have been 3 times already, cant get enough of the red chile. and i dont know of another place in town that makes sopapillas so yummy! we will be back!
being from new mexico,  i heard about chile addiction from friends.  this is our 2nd time in, and i had to express my overwhelming interest in this restaurant.  the food is amazing,  especially the carne adovada,  and the best sopapillas in nevada. love the service,  and the owners make you feel right at home. we will be back, and back again. john and rebeca
this place is fantastic!  great food, service, and atmosphere. i will definitely be coming here often!
if youre looking for great new mexico style food then this is your place. the food is great and they even know what you mean when you say you want it done christmas! i would highly recommend coming here. we will be back often!
this is the best new mexican restaurant! ! people must understand that our food isnt mexican what so ever. it has a different cooking techniques,  taste, texture and flavors. our food has a lot of flavors and we like it hot!! this place has authentic new mexican taste. quit comparing our food to mexican food!!
finally, an authentic green chile cheeseburger! it is excellent. easily one of the best burgers in vegas.  i hope this place lasts.
as a fellow new mexican, we are always excited to see the zia symbol.  we tried chile addiction and it was awesome. a great taste of home for sure! i had the red enchiladas stacked with an egg and my husband had the carne adovada. both were absolutely delicious.  the service was amazing and the owners sat and talked with us for a while. super welcoming and very good food!
finally!!!!  we have a restaurant in las vegas that serves wonderful hatch chile and true new mexican food.  im not talking about the bland stuff you get at so many mexican eateries in this town.  there is a huge difference.  from the first bite i was transformed back to santa fe, taos, albuquerque, etc...  the heat from the red and green chile was amazing, so fresh, so flavorful,  for the faint of heart there is an option of mild chile.  i had stacked cheese enchiladas with both red and green chile topped with a fried egg so good, and refried beans and rice.    my husband had the stuffed chile rellenos which he always loved in new mexico.  we were both in heaven and oh, the sopas, just so substantial and yet fluffy.  for dessert, we shared the fried ice cream which did not disappoint.my husband and i went to chile addiction for an early dinner yesterday with high hopes.  the food and service surpassed our expectations.  the owner and servers were most gracious and wanting to please.  the ambiance and decor was also a nice surprise.  we couldnt believe we actually found this gem.  i am sure we and our extended family will become regulars.
this place rocks! this is our new favorite mexican spot! very clean, friendly and the food it awesome!i highly recommend it!
yummy, first bite had me flash backing to my days at the frontier  across from unm! the rest was gone in a flash. yummy!  sopapillas were great!!!
say what!!! chile addiction must have stolen mamas recipes! this is the real deal new mexican food! taste like my childhood dinner plate! delish! its rare to find true new mexican food here in vegas and paul hit the put the spice in . redgreen hatch chile, stacked enchiladas, sopapillas, green chile stew and pasole all traditional favorites. i cant wait to bring my mom!
well i ordered chicken enchiladas to go xtra xtra hot. what i got was chicken tamales and the green chili was mild. it was good but disappointing at the same time. i just love this place. the owners really know how to treat their customers. they made me chicken enchiladas that are to die for im eating them for breakfast!!  thanks for taking care of me.
growing up in new mexico, i was skeptical that this place would be authentically new mexican.  but i was pleasantly surprised!  the food is amazing here!  highly recommend!
this place is very good. its very casual and relaxed. i would say the business is family and friends run which you can tell by how comfortable the employees. it should still be run slightly more professional. i have it 5 stars because the food was off the charts including sopaipillas with a little honey were so spot on. i enjoy coming here and trying new things everytime. i had the burrito last time looking through the menu to see what im gonna get for dinner tonight. oh also you have to try the fried ice cream which is made with rice crispies instead of corn flakes this really makes a great fried ice cream so much better. definitely try this place out and i look forward to this place being around for many dinners to come.
the enchiladas de carne asada were amazing and the sopapillas were just as good. my wife had the red chile pozole and she loved it. all in all, this place was delicious and you cant beat the prices for such quality!
holy crap!! so nice to have a great nm chile joint here in vegas!! had the chile verde and a chile relleno and the were both top four i have ever eaten.  you can taste the nm  hatch chiles in both dishes.  will be eating here as often as i can, excited to try all the other dishes. great job folks, see you again soon!
authentic new mexican food!!!! the red chile is too die for!!!!awesome food, awesome service! what more can you ask for!
loved this place and loved the food! the owner was very nice!!!
4th visit and i am addicted! what a wonderful find so close to where i live. very impressed especially as theyve only opened june 1st 2 months ago.the decor is comfortable, new mexican appropriate while remaining upscale and avoiding that kitschy cheap look. service is thoughtful, attentive and warm. the owners paul  amy are truly hospitable. pricing is incredibly approachable and fair for the filling portions. and now the food...delicious! warm christmas chips to the table with a mildmedium house made salsa. pork adovada is fall apart, rich and saucy. guacamole is bright and green, their take as its not the traditional cilantro, salty laden mix. posole is thicker and more stew like but nevertheless tasty. tamales and enchiladas are decent but what makes everything standout is the sauces. the green sauce hasnt been blended so its chunks of chile and the red sauce is smooth, developed spice without being burn the mouth hot, and quite frankly...addicting!  sopapillas are airy, fresh and not greasy.  best fried ice cream as the outside is still warm and extra crispy while the ice cream is gasp still cold! im not from nor have i been to new mexico. but, ive been enjoying mexican cuisine for about 20 years, consider myself a motivated foodie, and its a different, refreshing spin that i highly recommend!
theres something about green chilies.  you could smother a car bumper in roasted green chilies and it would be good.this place doesnt serve car bumpers, it serves the best new mexico cuisine in a fourstate area.  dont go here looking for texmex or mexican.  here youll find only the freshest ingredients creating the freshest and most flavorful meals in town.i had the chile rellenos and they were incredible.  nothing here is less than the best and freshest in town.ill see you all there, probably next week.
love this place! real food! my whole family is from new mexico and this is the first restaurant to ever hit vegas that has real food! and for those of you that have a problem with how the items are named on the menu, take a chill pill! youre obviously unhappy and need this kind of food in your life to make you enjoy it! ;
we came here with our friend who is a true new mexico chile head. the restaurant is decorated really nicely with a n.m. theme thats fun and inviting. our server told us it was her first night, but she was great. we ordered the appetizer sampler and everything on it was delicious. we all enjoyed the basket of fresh sopaipilla . i ordered the stacked enchilada with green chiles. damn good, very well done. wifey had the tacos and they were wonderful too. great place and recommend.
food is amazing! so glad my friend from nm wanted to check this place out! service was great and the place is really clean! cant wait to go back!
this place is excellent we ordered lunch for our whole staff at lotus broadcasting 80 plus ppl they did a great job and the food was excellent.  we also did catering order for a client and it was excellent.  listen to komp 92.3 or the point 97.1 to win lunch for two on us.
my roommate from college and best friend is from new mexico, so since i first met her, she started feeding me new mexican food and i am thankful for this because i love new mexican food! ive had homemade new mexican meals, have been to new mexico and had food there, and have had new mexican food in different cities. so when i heard about chile addiction, i went and tried it. it was so worth it. me and my friend went all out, because we wanted to try so many different things. first, they serve you complimentary chips and salsa, which is what they do in every true new mexican restaurant good start ; . we shared as an appetizer the green chile stew, which was spicy and wonderful. we then decided to try the red chile enchiladas with a fried egg on top, and the stuffed sopapilla this one with green chile. we both shared the two meals, and they were both delicious. we finished it all, and then even had room for dessert!!! we couldnt leave without eating some sopapillas with honey, which are always a must, and were of course delicious. we also decided to try the fried ice cream. it was the first time any of us had had fried ice cream, and it exceeded both of our expectations. also, we got it for free just for checking in on yelp! so food was delicious, and our server was super friendly and helpful. five stars well earned!!!!
i loved the spicy red and green chile sauce!  it reminded me so much of new mexico!  and the sopapillas were great!  i felt the prices were very reasonable.  the portions were very generous.  i had to take some food home.  i am planning a trip back very soon!
first time customer, in for breakfast and made the drive from across town to enjoy some authentic new mexican cuisine. i ordered the huevos rancheros smothered in red chile and had them add carne adovada to the mix which made it that tastier. i opted for sopapillas instead of the flour tortillas. i totally enjoyed my breakfast and will return! i also appreciated the free desert on checkin. i had the fried ice cream, make sure you save room!
i was raised in albuquerque and its rare to find greenred chile here in las vegas. the food is great and the customer service is amazing! amy always greets me with a smile and a friendly hello. they pay attention to my custom orders and they are always willing to do the right thing! i live only a few blocks away so i feel very lucky to have this taste of new mexico restaurant so close to me! so everyone from nm that hasnt tried it yet, please support!!!!
everyone is crazy this food is for sure new mexico food it is not mexican food.new mexico is a state and do not get me wrong i love mexican food but i also love new mexico food there chile verde and chile rojo is the best chilie ever! yes you can get enchiladas and fajitas and i had a chimichunga my husband had the green chile stew. yes it takes a bit for your food but it is fresh! ray served us he was awesome! so for those of you that are giving bad ratings you do not know new mexico food for those of you that want to try it you have to go!
this place has the best service ive had since moving to vegas, not to mention the food is great and the portions could feed a bear.
you can get mexican food anywhere, you can only get authentic new mexican food from a few places in las vegas; chile addiction is one. huevos rancheros with red chile and carne adovado like you might find at garcias or durans in albuquerque. nice open atmosphere and great service. theyll be seeing me a lot!
came here with the bf. we both loved it! green chile burger is on point! great food  even better service! we will def be back. :
delicious food!  amazing service. i asked them to put extra chiles on everything and it was no problem!  took good care of my son too. really liked the abovada, spicy and tasty!
disclaimer:  im not from new mexico.  but ive visited there on many occasions.  this food is legit.stopped by on a saturday night and ordered the carne adovada stacked enchilada with calabacitas and refried beans and a bowl of green chile stew to go.i got a goddamn pie plate chock full of rojo sauce goodness!  with an egg on top!  i havent eaten food this good in a very long time.  no way a human could eat all of this food...lord knows i tried.the green chile stew was almost as good.  it was a bit more spicy than the stacked enchilada, but the flavor wasnt as complex.  i loved it, though.the food was so freaking good that i had to make another to go order on wednesday...it was just as good as i remembered.wish they had a liquor license  id certainly dine in if they had beer.
chile addiction gives the diner a great new mexican cuisine experience and a great value, too.i had the rolled carne asada enchiladas and my wife had the frito pie.  both entrees were delicious and the portions were quite generous.  the carne asada tasted fresh and not dry like some mexican restaurants.we do not get dessert at restaurants that often, but i am glad we got the fried ice cream.  it was coated with rice krispies and the ice cream was solid.the atmosphere featuring southwestern and native american decor was nicely done.our bill before tip was only 22.
i came here from san diego but im from santa fe and i must say this place nails it .. everything is delicious and totally reminds of home. amy the owner is so nice and sweet and totally made my visit there great. if you like good new mexican food please go see them you wont be disappointed
this review is mostly because it was the best customer service experience i have ever had. when our order called for fresh avocado and they didnt have any, they didnt tell us they were out  the owner went to the grocery store to get some.  it made it take a few extra minutes, but it was awesome of them to do so.  when we asked them about where we could go to get cash without an atm card, they made a way for us to get it themselves.  they allowed us to customize our order to mix and match two of the salad options without the least bit of acting annoyed that we were going off the menu a bit. all our service was from the owners, and i was happy to do my bit to support a great local small business while traveling through las vegas. the food was good, and very affordable, and the portions were huge. fried ice cream was delicious and enormous.  i would have liked some more flavor in the chicken and the dressing, but ordering a chicken salad, i wasnt expecting the most exciting meal of my life. and the service was so amazing, it puts this review over the top.
being a hispanic from wyoming and colorado in las vegas options for new mexican food come far between, the only other location i know of is carlitos but is completely on the other side of town. its great that there is an option just down the street. this restaurant is very clean and the server was extremely nice.!! i look forward to coming back.
first time here with my boyfriend passing by hes been to nw and had hatch chilli....definitely  will be coming again. cant complain very good. love the spice.
i am from new mexico and the food here was amazing. it was like being back home. excellent food with different fire rated red or green sauces  something for every pallate. you cant find sopapillas like these very much any more most places, if at all. the staff was very friendly and attentive.  you wont be disappointed.
i really appreciate the gentleman who just helped me here. he was very nice, all smiles, made me laugh after a rough afternoon. the selection was the standards starbucks selection. service was very prompt. overall, i cant complain as i definitely got better service here than most starbucks.
we randomly happened upon this place while on a road trip and went in 7 min before close. the owner was so patient while we wanted to taste many flavors they make their own ice cream with fresh fruit, but also have amazing mint oreo and cookies n cream im sure there were lots more that we didnt see! yum. hard to find because theres no sign, but its in between rocky rococo and el bolillo. as we left, their ice cream truck pulled up!
a hidden diamond! i had amazing bread pudding ice cream here. unique flavors, all made in house.the placevhas no sign and no flavor signs. ask the ice cream guy. the selection isbunusual and the quality is wonderful.just do it.stop eating boring slab slapped nonsense.get dangerous.
without a doubt the nicest looking tattoo shop in the valley. has a super cool mid century feel and is very clean. everyone in the shop was so nice and friendly that it made the whole experience very memorable. i went and had a cactus tattoo done, i had 3 other friends with me and we all got slightly different versions of the same thing. our artist kitt did a great job drawing them up and making any changes we wanted. he was very friendly and professional. you have to check this shop out! i already have my next appointment set up. so excited!
i went in here with my cousin for her tattoo appointment a few days ago and i was amazed by the cleanliness and overall aesthetic of this place! i had considered getting a tattoo for sometime now and decided that i might as well get one since i was there already. they were awesome enough to fit me in and im so glad i got it then. i was tattooed by paulski and he was amazing! it was my very first tattoo so i was very nervous, but the staff and paulski helped calm my nerves and kept my mind at ease throughout the session. all of the artists are very friendlytalented and lively so it made my experience so much better and fun. if i ever decide to get another tattoo in the future, i will most likely return to the golden rule. highly recommend this place, whether youre brand new to tattoos or experienced.
i was freaking out to get my first tattoo. but cerny helped me feel at ease and comfortable from the first visit to when he finished my tattoo. hes super talented and patient and couldnt have asked for a more perfect first tattoo. the shop is very clean, everyone is extremely friendly and kind i will come back for my second one here for sure.thank you so much cerny you did amazing! and thank the you golden rule for popping my tattoo cherry. ;
cerny did a great job! he even fixed an older tattoo that another artist did. i came out here from birmingham, al for a great tattoo and cerny did not let me down at all!! the shop was awesome!! the bathroom was the coolest thing ive ever seen. major props to this shop and the owners for such a cool atmosphere and style.
my husband got a huge rib piece from jason when he was at the other shop and more recently from paulski. the shop is super clean and really cool looking. the staff up front was really friendly while i waited and even offered me candy!
this place is the best! theyre always so friendly and in such a good mood when they greet you and help make appointments. my artist stephanie is so sweet and so talented. she always emails me back in a timely manner and my sessions with her are always pleasant. we laugh and always have something to talk about. i absolutely recommend this place to a first timer or someone who has tons of tattoos.
i love coming here...ive seen paulski multiple times at the camelback location now, and every time has been a very pleasant and memorable experience. golden rule tattoo holds themselves to a very high standard and this is apparent from the minute you walk in. staff is very friendly, welcoming, and professional...the artists are all super talented, and the shop itself is as clean as an operating table. as far as arizona is concerned, golden rule is the only shop i fux with.
i got tattooed by paul on saturday. he did a good sized piece on my forearm and man, i just have a few things to say about this shop.1. believe the advertising. they were really nice, positive, and stupidly clean. you could eat off the floor here. the rapport among the staff was awesome and the environment was really calm and welcoming.2. paul is fing awesome at his job. he took his time on my drawing, was diligent and focused when doing his work. his lines were crisp and clean and the color turned out beautiful. he sketched my tattoo, finished drawing it up in about an hour, and then got to work. he explained every intricate detail of the design elements and even asked steph for some perspective on the design to make it better. the guy knows his stuff and does a damn good job.3. price was outstandingly reasonable for my piece. for the type of servicetattoo that i got here i got my moneys worth and then some.4. parking sucks. show up early. thats my only complaint. if you come here with a patient, friendly, open minded attitude, and let the artists here do their jobs i.e., give them some creative freedom and be nice theyll return it in spades.ive never been happier with a tattoo and i plan on coming back to see paul as often as my wallet allows.
superior service! greeted when i walked in the door even though there was another customer already speaking with an employee. the quoted price was exactly what i was charged. it was ready sooner than they said it would be. had the glass replaced on an ipad 3 for 130. i will probably have them do my cell phone since it has cracks too. the ipad 3 looks brand new. if there was a 6th star, i would give them all 6!
took a very broken iphone 5c for them to take a look at. it had a smashed screen and a little bit of water damage. they fixed it in about 40 minutes and everything is working perfectly. a fair price, and good service.
i had my computer for a little over a year and my hard drive had suddenly died, leaving me without a working computer. i tried talking to dell, but they were no use, and i tried bringing it to another computer shop but they did not offer to help much. i decided to come here as a last effort and im so glad i found the place! they managed to fix my computer within a day, hard drive and all, and make it like it was brand new! they did an amazing job and the customer service was excellent! the price was very reasonable as well, compared to the other options i had! i am extremely satisfied with my service! will definitely recommend them to friends and family with any sort of electronics issues in the future and will come back again for any other needs : thank you for the great service!
i cracked my iphone 5s, it was bad. i was already having a terrible day. i frantically searched for a place to fix my screen. my mom said she had seen this place. i called and it was a bit after 6pm. they said if i got there within 10 minutes they could fix it for me. i got there and was greeted instantly, even though he was helping another customer. i paid exactly what they quoted me and they even stayed a few minutes later  than closing to finish my phone. i walked out of there incredibly pleased. not only were they efficient, but they were very nice. my total was 108.79. i would recommend ubreakifix goodyear to anybody! thank you so much
this place is perfect! the owner of the store greeted me with a huge smile. he was very professional and they fixed the screen on my iphone 6 in a timely manner. i give it 2 thumbs up!
my daughter dropped her 5c into the water and it immediately went dead.  having had water damage in the past i had little hope we would be able to fix it.  i called the shop and they had me bring it down for a diagnostic.  after 2 hours with the phone they had it up and running.  i cant say enough about the costumer service we received and thankful we went there first.  thank you for your help.pete
i was in dire need of fixing my shattered iphone 5s  battery replacement. was greeted by their  friendly staff. they told me it would be 140 ish for everything  would take about 45 min. they were super quick  friendly. would recommend them to anyone!
friendly, polite, knowledgeable, and fast service. highly recommend! iphone6 plus screen repair was 129.99.
this place was awesome.  customer service with a smile and knowledge to go along with it.  my son has his ipod touch back after a very long time.  very easy to work with and reasonable.  i was referred here by a competitor that told me to go here because they fix anything!! make this your first stop in the future, no need to go anywhere else :

my experience with elite was, and still is, positive. jeff is always extremely prompt with communication. i never feel neglected or second tier in service. i also have seen amazing results working with elite. i love the fact that jeff can make recommendations that start working immediately. all in all, i would recommend this company to any of my closest friends.
i dont put my name behind many things, but this man is a marketing genius. the guarantee isnt made lightly. my knowledge would have been irrelevant by the time i learned on my own what i learned from this guy in three months. as a marketing consultant, i give my full endorsement!
elite phoenix seo is a phenomenally talented small business growth seo firm. it has been such a pleasure to work with them. theyve got great energy, professionalism, and an incredibly strategic methodology. elite has especially helped us with growth strategies for our new business; as a direct result of their efforts we have added over 1,000 names to our email marketing database, in under 6 months! also, owner jeff has been instrumental in connecting us with the best resourcesas far the different technology vendors and how to negotiate the best prices. hes a wealth of information and resources, and his creativity has added a lot to our overall communications and leadgen strategy. i highly, highly encourage any opportunity you get to work with this company. they are the best!
hands down the best pulled pork of any current food truckstand ive tasted in montreal. the meat is flavourful, the prices are reasonable for the portion size and the service is quick and friendly. theyve always got everything you need ready by the truck, too  rolls of paper towels, forks, extra bbq sauce...try anything from this truck and youll be happy with it. their sandwiches are awesome, filling but never too messy. the smoke dog is a little messy but delicious. the poutine will make strangers jealous that they are not you, at that moment in time, eating that poutine. the mac and cheese is the only item on their menu that im not 100 happy with, but id still eat it again.definitely worth your time and money.
went to quebec for a music festival a few months ago, and le smoking bbq was there. we tried a couple other food trucks, but le smoking blew them out of the water! we were hooked and ate no where else for the rest of the fest. its in a league of its own. im from the states and i thought we knew bbq, and i was dead wrong. my mouth still waters thinking and imagining their food. the ribs fall off the bone and the bbq pork poutine fries were unlike anything i have ever had! its hard to comprehend that it was coming from a food truck! i actually consider driving the twothree hours to montreal just to quench my craving for their food on a weekly bases.
i have eaten there three times already and the food has been incredible on each occasion.its very cheap considering the quality and its a nice place to eat when youre in a hurry.my favourite so far is the pizza with a big salmon strip on it. amazing caviar covering the fish as well.im so glad i live near this place. they also have home made pop, and pastries which looked delicious. oh and the green salad was great. really unique pistachio dressing.
a new neighbourhood gem! theres something so charming, sincere and open about this place and then the food is mouthwateringly delicious. inspired pizza, salads, sandwiches and sodas the chef has a real sense for new combinations with attention to detail and quality ingredients. and all at superaffordable prices! plus, open mondays!!!
mon nouveau coin prefere ! deux fois en deux jours : la nourriture est sublime et tellement fraiche, mais mon coup de coeur sont pour les gens qui y travaillent. attentionnes envers les clients, sympathiques et tellement gentils. merci pour tout
amazing!  had the smoked salmon pizza and beet salad, calamari and chocolate tarte...cannot even decide what was my favorite.  so good i was moved to write my first yelp review.
je suis devenue completement folle de ce petit cafe! farine est un petit coffee shop italien qui se situe dans le mile end et na ouvert quil ya quelques mois. lendroit est chaleureux, design, lumineux et le capuccino y est delicieux! jai craque pour une petite tartelette aux noix de pecan quand jy suis allee et elle etait delicieuse! farine propose aussi des pizzas et autres petits encas, que je gouterai probablement tres prochainement !!
hokulia shave ice has a great staff that runs the place very well. i am not a huge fan of shave ice myself, but the product is quality and a quality portion size. i would recommend for anyone who is looking to cool off in the las vegas summer heat. this is the place to go for shave ice in las vegas.
yummy favors , nice service and huge portions. my kids and i will be coming back very often this summer for a cool treat!!
best shaved ice around. they are huge too! my husband and i usually just share the smallest. they also have a million flavors to choose from. and dont forget to get ice cream and a snow cap on your snow cone! its the best!
absolutely delicious. so many flavors to choose from, almost everything you can think of. definitely found a new spot i will be going to in the future and referring friends to. friendly staff and good service.
the shaved ice was delicious. reminds me of our trip to maui on our way to hana. i highly recommend this location. the service was fast and friendly.
though it is in a funny location, i dont think anyone minds making a pit stop to grab some shaved ice! dont miss it though! it can be really easy to overlook if youre not really looking because it is a truck stand located at a gas stationshop.im from the small town east coast, where shaved ice was a delicacy during concerts and shows and disney on ice...so having a place so close to my house reminded me of my childhood, the 90s, when kids were obsessed with all things artificially flavored with food coloring like gushers and fruit roll ups and shaved ice. there are so many flavors and various toppingsthe list is almost endless! and you can get as many flavors on your cone as the staff can fit! but the staff can put quite a lot because they give you a ton of ice, no matter what size you end up getting. my two favorite flavors are tigers blood and blue hawaii. just a warning, i know some people dont like shaved ice because it is entirely dependent on how much artificial flavoring is poured on, so just be warnedshaved ice is not shaved snow! enjoy and stay cool ;
this place is great! huge sizes and lots of different flavors. theres not much shade to duck under while you wait in the heat, but theyre definitely worth it.
we went to this store for years at its former south scottsdale location. it is the best ever and i am so happy to see it resurrected on the west side. they have the greatest selection of sodas you can find anywhere. of course, sometimes they will be out of your favorite. dont base your visit on a single soda and if thats the way you are then call in advance. shame on anyone for giving a one star review to this most fantastic of places just because they didnt call in advance to see if their particular soda was in stock. we always grab an empty 24 case box that they have in the shop and fill it up with an assortment. we have so many favorites that can only be found here that if one of ours is missing that day we have no trouble filling up the box with everything else we could ever desire. i could list favorites here for you, but my best advice to you would be to pick up some of your own favorites but to most definitely experiment. just get yourself to the shop and try something  the colder the better. ask for advice! you cant go wrong here. i hope pop the soda shop manages to find a way to stay in the valley from here on out. im a huge fan!
this was a lot of fun for us and our children.  theres  lots of interesting soda to look through and try.
same items, different owner, completely different pricing system.  if you are looking to find an exact replica of the old scottsdale locations, this is as close as it gets.  after a failed business venture in downtown phoenix, the name has reemerged, but not the same ma  pa feel.  all sodas are priced at 1.99 a bottle, no matter how mainstream or unique it is and for a sixpack you are looking at 9.95.  there is still a big selection, but only about 40 feet of shelving.  the plus side to this new location is that it was bought by an owner that is already established in the area, so the chances of this place disappearing is less likely.  today i am going to try a couple different root beers, but i will return to try other rarities in the near future.im raising my rating to 5 stars, from 4 stars and here is why.  i spoke with the new owners and they were totally cool, very nice and thanked me for visiting solely based on my recognition of the company name.  im still a little bummed about the pricing, but it is what it is.  just keep bringing in unique sodas for us all to try and i will continue bringing in my hard earned money to buy them!
i came here for my very first wax, very pleasant experience and felt very comfortable and just very professional and quick but still makes you at ease! i would recommend this place to anyone who is thinking about getting anything waxed
amazing waxing experience! she was super fast, efficient and most importantly very friendly which made the time go by quickly! i will definitely come back here when i am in vegas!
i am so glad i tried a hard wax brazilian! i will never go back to soft wax.  it was a great experience and edna was great, super sweet and made me feel very comfortable.  i will definitely be back
excellent all the way around, location, close to zoo, stadium, old town scottsdale lots of stores and restaurants. clean modern and a great value in room size for the money. loved the courtyard with the aviary and beautiful grass and trees. quiet although its on main street. booked on line and had a mix up in reservation ,call management had it all taken care of by the time we arrived and staff changed rooms for me to ground floor next to daughters room. breakfast was very good with lots of selections, cereal, waffles, fruit, yogurt, toast, bagels  juice coffee and teas, in a nice dining area with cloth on tables and cloth napkins. would stay here again with no concerns.
front desk costumer service was amazing.  parking was really good and was included. waffle maker is great included for breakfast at the restaurant.  i really enjoyed the outdoor layout.  very nice pool and fountains make it an oasis in the desert.location is really close to old town and lots of cool restaurants.  dont be discouraged by the exterior.  the rooms are clean and updated.
great surprise! this hotel was better than i expected since the rooms we booked were 12 off. we had a cool fireplace in our room. excellent all the way around, location, close to zoo, stadium, old town scottsdale lots of stores and restaurants. clean modern and a great value in room size for the money. loved the courtyard with the aviary and beautiful grass and trees. quiet although its on main street.  the breakfast was decent for continental buffet. the bartender was a hoot! no charge for the business room or for the front desk to send a fax for me. the only thing i can think of that would make it an even better place is if the pool water was warmer. it was 99 degrees out for most of our stay and the water was so cold that it wasnt comfortable to swim, also no hot tub. it was a great stay! thanks!
wife and i just stayed this past weekend.  wonderful experience.  room was clean and updated and the ac worked great.  pool was nice and well kept.  we were allowed to use the business center with no issues including printing documents.  the staff was very happy and welcoming.  the breakfast is more than adequate with something for everyone.
i feel bad for people who dont drink. when they wake up in the morning, thats as good as theyre going to feel all day. ― frank sinatraheres the real review now that im soberill be the first to admit that gin is not my choice of alcohol.  its not a great mixer drink like vodka or rum and it has a strong distinct taste that only an older person can enjoy.  this class has changed my life!walking into the swanky establishment known as the gladly, we were told to wait as they were still setting up after the 6pm class.  once we were inside, we were greeted with a gift bag, a strong gin and tonic, and some tasty bruschetta and tea sandwiches.  i especially liked the salmon sandwich and the cucumber one.  i suppose coming into class with only two tacos for lunch was my downfall and the bread consumed only helped me soak up the booze faster but yaaaas!  lets have some fun!about 30 of us imbibed on the gin and tonics and ate our cute little sandwiches and then mix master mark took the stage.  he gave us a history on why hendricks is far superior than other gins they really are  botanicals, made in small batches, and a duo distillery process! and how a peculiar gin company in scotland, where whiskey tends to rule the roost, made a wonderful product because of the cutest chemist lady ever.  after that comes the exciting part:  lets make some draaaanks!  we watched mix master mark work his magic before he released us slightlybuzzed ducklings into the wild jungle full of fragile glass, a citrus press, and long swirly spoons.  we made a cucumber lemonade sooo refreshing, a blueberry delight my fave, and a merry groupmade winter tenure punch it really does taste like christmas from the bitters.  with gin this good and smooth, im a fan.  hendricks is king!the gladly offered the class a wonderful space at the back of the restaurant and really took care of us.  my tablemates specifically kazi h.  okay, really just kazi h. would get a new bucket of ice and promptly drop it and we kept running out of garnish but they refilled everything with a smile.  i want to come back and try their food!thank you mark, hendricks, and the gladly for inviting us yelper and our 1s!  it was a super fun experience and my views about gin has changed! a toast,drink until the sun comes up;drink until the sun goes down.if you drink on both occasions,you will never wear a frown!cheers!
five gin drinks, six appetizers and mix master mark  one fun event carry the headachei am not a gin drinker.  however, after tasting the cocktails we created at this event i am adding hendricks gin to my bar.  i also enjoyed sipping the gin straight which was smooth and subtly complex. it was cool to taste the flavor different garnishes brought out of the gin. i think the deal with this kind of event is yelpers get a nocost event and the vendor gets the possibility of positive social media and word of mouth.  in that spirit hendricks gin is a good fit for yelpers who imbibe.  the company puts an emphasis on style and uniqueness, just like yelpers.  as soon as you see the apothecary bottle it is clear they care about heritage and enjoy being old school. this is a quirky fun drink for awesome people.
i love gin! but i had never heard of or seen hendricks before, so it was exciting to have a little tasting party centered around it. after sitting through a 20minute lecture on the history of the product, and how its made everyone was gradually buzzing off the complimentary gin  tonics at the beginning, we received stepbystep instructions on how to make a couple of basic cocktails. i totally loved the cucumber lemonade, and i suppose the blueberry variant was refreshing as well. by the end of it all, mixmastermark pretty cool brand ambassador could barely keep our boozedup crowd under control while explaining the group project: the punch bowl!in the end, we found ourselves enjoying our creations at the bar of the gladly. it all felt a little hurried, but this is still a good event that had me sold on a product.
loved this event! im obsessing over gin right now. i loved learning how to make these fabulous cocktails. its the perfect complement to the az heat. i look forward to entertaining by making the gin lemonade one very soon!
all of these events are just ridiculous. i mean....come on: 4 different gin drinks, enough to get me feeling las vegas good. thats a side of me you folks havent seen since the 2013 great gatsby event tips a 40 in remembrancefolks, this was a fun event, period. although i nearly nodded off in the presentation of what gin is, where it comes from, and how hendricks actually makes their gin....i pulled through! and what came out of this was an amazing opportunity to enjoy some really finely crafted cocktails. now i am poised to be a master cocktailer.... a cock of the walk shall you say?!i give them 5 stars all the way through for the gorgeous venue the gladly, the great host, the wonderful flavors of the mixers, the drink of choice hendricks gin, and for giving this to me for being an elite member of yelp....why thank you so much :
an enchanted evening of whimsy, wonder, and getting wasted. hendricks aesthetic is impossibly detailed in a vintagequirkymagical way think hot air balloon graphics and croquet mallet cocktail stirrers. im considering getting a full sleeve composed exclusively of the art on the goodie bags we were presented with upon arrival.  a few tipples, 36 salmon finger sandwiches, and several dozen fig  goat cheese toasts later, mixmastermark walked straight out of the 19th century and into the gladly. he led us through the history of hendricks scottish2 stillsmaster ladychemistbotanicals on fleek. then, we drank. on each table was an array of equipment, simple syrups, fresh fruits, ice, gin and juice... laid back. we made each cocktail after mmm demod with flair and finesse. there was merrymaking, liberal gin slinging, lemon juice flying, and selfies on selfies on selfies. a cucumber lemonade, groovy blueberry green tea lemonade, group project bowl of dodrinkthepunch, and several offcentered high fives later, we were unleashed into the gladly with more punch. mac n cheese and brussels sprouts over grits at the bar sealed off the session with a resounding hell yes. i was already a fan of both hendricks and the gladly, but this weekend im gladly buying a bottle of hendricks.
this was just fantastic.  exceeded my expectations.  youve heard it before  i dont like gin.  but now i love hendricks.  it was amazing to learn about the way that this gin is produced.  mixmastermark put on a fun, enthusiastic presentation and taught us to make amazing drinks.  my favorite was definitely the cucumber lemonade recipe that we made first.  not only were the drinks fantastic, but the food oh my gosh.  huge shoutout to the gladly for putting togetherer these hors doeuvres.  my favorite was the bruschetta with the cheese and was it fig ? on top.  i could have eaten a thousand of these, but i politely only ate 3.  the entire experience was just so much fun.  got to interact with other elites, drink amazing liquor taught by the brand ambassador himself, pair this with amazing food and even got a goody bag!  well hendricks, ya won me over!
fun, educational, and delicious! this was a great event where we were invited to learn all about hendricks gin and then had the opportunity to make cocktails with it. we started off with a simple gin  tonic served to us at the bar and then were served some yummy bites including tea sandwiches, bruschetta and mixed nuts. this was much needed as we were served 1 drink and then made 3 more cocktails. mix master mark put on an awesome educational presentation where we learned about the history of hendricks, how its made and what goes into it. we then got to make our own cocktails; a cucumber lemonade, blueberry green tea lemonade and then the whole table made the tenured punch together. all of these drinks were fantastic and are easy to recreate. i cant wait to make these at home. after the event we were able to mingle in the bar, and enjoy the rest of our drinks. i of course had to order the chopped salad and my husband had the duck meatloaf, both were amazing. thanks hendricks, the gladly and yelp for the education and a fun night!
the place is gorgeous and super fancy looking. when we walked into the background, impressive was the first word that came to mind. we had an entire setup to mix drinks in front of us to glasses, squeezers, stirrers, syrups, gin, etc., but first they told us to grab appetizers. the sandwiches were delicious. i really loved the smoked salmon and chicken sandwiches. the tomato and fig bruschetta were pretty good too. we were served a gin and tonic with cucumber spear to begin. as we were munching down, mix master mark gave us a presentation on hendricks gin. and then taught us how to make drinks.  we made a lemonade gin drink which was delicious. didnt know you can make a lemonade drink with gin. then it was a blueberry green tea drink. everyone at our table got to make their own and had a lot of fun talking and drinking. then mark did another presentation for us and taught us how to make punch for a party using hendricks gin. it was delicious! cinnamon punch tastes great!it was a classy event and everyone had a good time. the servers were great bringing us fresh ice and toppings and whatever we needed. thanks to them for helping out! and thanks to mix master mark for such an entertaining presentation and instructions. it was a great time and i know everyone appreciates it. too much alcohol for us to drink in the end because we made a huge bowl of punch!
fun, entertaining, educational night. i love that this wasnt just a demonstration and that we got to play as well! the host was funny and did a great job teaching and keeping you involved. the drinks... well they were just downright amazing! i didnt really know if i liked gin or not and dont think i really have ever given it a shot but i did and boy was i pleasantly surprised. while i still dont think i could drink it straight, the drinks we mixed were each better than the last and made me a fan! i will be making the blueberry lemondade one all summer long! gladly is a great spot and the finger foods were good and the drinks were downright amazing! nice little goodie bag and i am very happy to have the recipe cards to duplicate the nights concoctions.
tea sandwiches.... bruschetta.... adult beverages.... can it get better than this? this event was a lot of fun. we got to learn how to make several cocktails all with gin and then enjoy said cocktails. each one was good in its own way. the cocktails were tasty and the recipes were fairly easy, making it perfect to replicate at home.... and replicate i will! thanks to hendricks for this fabulous night!
so fun. so fun!thanks mixmastermark and the hendricks crew for putting on a great event. if the dpca comes to your city, out of town yelpers, i recommend you attend. marks a great presenter, the food is delicious, and the drinks are wonderful  and how much fun to craft them by your own hands. special thanks to the gladly for hosting this one in their beautiful venue.
this is one of the funnest things we have done in a while!! mix master mark was a great teacher and such a fun host. i was not a big gin drinker, but my eyes have been opened and i will be sipping hendricks lemonades all summer long!!! what a great way to share your product!!
think americana x gin x good company! seriously, how good does it get?to start the lovely event, mix master mark did a great job on the background history behind hendricks gin. from the start, production to what makes it so distinct i was truly sold even without prior knowledge of hendricks to begin with. sitting through this little educational bleb, we got to nibble on some finger sandwiches and bruschetta, some of my favorites being the smoked salmon and tomato  fig. as well as a standard starter cocktail, gin  tonic with a cucumber spear.we got to make a series of drinks all showcasing the versatility of hendricks gin in strong, fruity and refreshing drinks that were all up my alley. hell, any gin cocktail is up my alley i mean what? my favorite was the blueberry as it was made with a blueberry tea simple syrup and reminded me of summer! the huge punch bowl at the end was a huge success as it incorporated team work into it and of course the punch was fanfreakingtastic!such a wonderful cocktail class showcasing all that hendricks has to offer, a beautiful venue by the capital grille, mix master mark and the lovely yelp for providing this opportunity to learn and get boozy with it.
i used to drink gin....a lot of gin....back in my twenties. those days are still kind of hazy for me....and this was a fun reminder of those days.  in fact, this was the most fun i have had in a long time and it was all thanks to this delightful drink, henrdicks gin!  our host was amazing and the drinks were so divine!  the room our class was in was so beautifully decorated and fully stocked so we could make drinks and party!  we started off with a gin education, followed by the story of how hendricks came about and was made.  who knew there was such a science to it?!  they use such fine ingredients....no wonder it is so tasty.  the best part was that we got to make cocktails featuring this wonderful spirit.  i feel like a pro now and cant wait to make some gininfused cocktails at home.  heck, i think i may start drinking gin again more regularly....but only if it is hendricks.  wowza its good!  thank you hendricks gin and yelp for a great time!  our host was the best!
5 stars isnt enough, id give them at least a 12.we moved to az a little over a year ago.  my wife and i spent an afternoon cleaning windows inside and out.  we were quite pleased with ourselves until the sun went down.  streaks everywhere!  we made an appointment with desert heat window wash, they were prompt courteous and professional.  our windows look great morning, noon or night.  they have been out twice since and i wouldnt let anyone else touch our windows.  we found the best and were staying with them.
rusty sanford, owner of desert heat window cleaners, far exceeded my expectations.  i needed the exterior of my windows cleaned for my realtors photographer, that i found out last minute, was coming the next morning.  not only did he come out and give me an estimate, which was less than i expected, he said he could do the job the next morning at 6am so the windows would be spotless for pictures.  the quote was for the outside and inside of all the windows, the tracks, sills and the screens.  wow, this just gets better and better!  so, he actually showed up at the given time, made all of my windows sparkle...and cleaned up!  ok, you have a customer for life! rusty, i, and my realtor, thank you  your crew very much.
great customer service!great job!rusty sanford, the owner dispelled the myth that getting your windows cleaned is a luxury.  it was a lot more affordable than i expected, but it wasnt all about the price.  i didnt just get clean windows, i got beautiful, sparkling clean windows...inside and out!  they also cleaned all of the screens and the sills.  rusty knew i was putting my house on the market that same day, and having an open house the following day, so he also cleaned every glass and mirrored surface in the house...just to be nice!  he knew i had a cleaning service come over the day before and he wanted to show me what they either missed or left smudges on.  note to self...let cleaners clean everything except windows, glass  mirrors, and let desert heat do their magic on those items.  by the way, the open house went great and all of the realtors commented on the windows.  our house sold in less than a week!  thanks rusty and crew!
im a soupesoup fan. i like their restaurants on duluth and stdenis, and appreciate that they each have their own character. i was excited to try their new location. yay! the place is cute, the staff is nice, and the latte and cookie i had were tasty as usual. cant wait to try the sandwiches and soups  im sure they are delicious as in the other restaurants, but ill get back to you with an update after i try them. the only negative point is that ive always found their items pricy, but its a nice occasional treat. oh, and btw, they take credit cards which they dont take in some of the other locations.
i have walked by this restaurant on several occasions, but decided to go in on this cold saturday afternoon. the staff were all very pleasant and patient, all smiling. the food was incredible!  i had the tomato soup with a grilled cheese sandwich. it was yummy! the soup had a great consistency and just a bit of a kick.  the grilled cheese was perfect! aged cheddar, multi grain bread, the best!  my friend had the cream of celery soap which he loved. i had a sample and it was really good.  the celery was not overpowering, good flavor! i will most definitely come back!  good job guys!
a la recherche dune bonne soupe maison ? nallez pas plus loin, soupesoup est lendroit y ideal pour cela. il est possible de deguster son bol fumant sur place mais aussi demporter et ce, dans divers formats. personnellement, jai un faible pour le melange choux, brocolis et celeris qui etait un vrai regal ! lendroit est aussi tres chaleureux et accueillant, sans oublier quil sy degage une agreable odeur de soupe cest parfait lhivers. bien que specialise dans la soupe, on peut tout de meme y trouver dautres mets comme des sandwichs, salades,...et on peut egalement y prendre son petit dejeuner.
great job with our tree removal!  a neighbor had a ginormous pine tree removed recently, which even needed a crane to take it down.  i went out to see the spectacle and took a business card from one of the nice guys on the crew.  i called, made an appointment, and mike came out to give us a quote for removing our two pine trees and a boxwood shrub.  he was very professional and gave us a really reasonable price on the tree removal and stump grinding.  i got two other quotes, and mikes was slightly cheaper than the other two.a couple of days later, the crew came and removed the trees.  they were efficient and left everything very clean.  a few days later, a very nice guy, brian, came and ground all three stumps.  the stump removal was surprisingly inexpensive and he did a great job for us.  i cant vouch for their other services which i havent used, but they did a fantastic job with our tree removal.
the drinks are great! awesome atmosphere, music is awesome! the bartenders are super friendly definitely will be returning here! very clean and good gaming!
the food offerings are a few of the best menu items from the baguette cafe next door. served until 2:00am! not only that, but the chefowner from bc will be creating a bar menu to go with it, which i am certainly looking forward to. if you like somewhat healthy choices and kind, knowledgable bartenders in a great atmosphere  then this is the spot for you.
really intimate and classy bar that reminds me of old vegas!  tucked away in a office complex it is such a nice surprise!  perfect for a rendezvous with mr special!  loved it:
new place in the south west. hidden behind some office buildings on sunset, but really makes for a quaint hideaway. classy, clean atmosphere with a nice corner stage for live entertainment. bartenders were polite, and professional. menu had some really delicious sounding items on it. i tried the chipotle burger. id recommend it. also saw some others having the gourmet pizzas. they too looked and smelled great. the green room definitely has that local vibe. in fact there was a couple local celebs the night i was in. carrot top, zoe bowie, etc..i will be back soon to check out some of the live music.
amazing. nichole and phil great bartenders. rita sang tonight and killed it. full house. even met the owners. they should be beyond proud. and i never do yelp reviews but had to.
this place is great. good atmosphere and drinks. sleek decor. love that they have music on saturday night.
good appetizersdrinkslive music! come on thru!very chill atmosphere. its so rad that folks created their own dance floor around the tables. love the sweetness and fire in this place.
i do tend to only go to places i love and this is one of them.  you can find me there on thursday nights, friday mornings at 1:00 am during the recording of tom manns sports show cohosted by johnpaul daluz.  its next door to the baguette cafe, which is a nice bonus!
excellent coffee says more about an establishment than just excellent coffee. it speaks to cleanliness, staff quality and training, and management knowledge and integrity. and the sandwiches were superb is well. service cant be beat with a stick, but the place is sure difficult to find and get to due to the construction, yet as you can tell  worth it.
great place...awesome beer selections draught and bottle! the food is amazing! dont miss the truffle steakhouse burger! mac daddy monday! 10 unlimited toppings on you mac n cheese!pimp your burger wednesday! 10 unlimited toppings
wow, finally opened! great burgers and drinks. the beer selection is amazing! the large screen tvs will be great come football season! there is a great selection of dogs as well! over 100 beers too chose from! this place has a lot to offer! welcome to the neighborhood!
perfect sports bar! t.vs everywhere, great draft and bottled beer selection! the menus has something for everyone. nice to have a good sports bar walking distance from home! they have a good happy hour and i will definitely be back!
thrilled that this place is so good and so close to my office. we needed a fun, friendly, and shockingly gourmet burger joint nearby! throw a fried egg on top of any burger and be sure to order the tater tots. get the frankensteiner beer and a stadium hotdog for 7.  if you order the fire chips, get the sauce on the side to keep them from getting soggy at the end. great atmosphere and exceptional sports bar food!
came in for my brothers birthday and the service and food was great! the manager bought us all a round of shots for free! the tater tot nachos were awesome! so close to home! def will be coming back! esp for football season!!
i love this place. everyone that works here is so nice and the food is amazing. get a burger. if you dont get a burger you will be missing out. i get mine with an egg but you dont have to. fun bar.
my husband and i came here for the first time. he ordered iced tea really liked it and arizona burger. he really  liked it. i ordered a corona and the ring of fire burger and loved it. the service was great but it was loud because of the cardinals game. but we are definitely coming back here.
finally the office has been replaced with a decent burgerbeer joint! and with plenty of room and lots on tap and completely remodeled, its our new favorite go to neighhood casual hangout!
great update from the office. all good.
very clean, steven and tommy are amazing. theyve had some new aromatic oils which was kinda interesting. the room is very quiet, we will be back!
very clean, steven and tommy are amazing. theyve had some new aromatic oils which was kinda interesting. the room is very quiet, we will be back! edit: just as good as last
unbelievable value. the hardest working foot spaticians in las vegas, and consistent, and the flattest and widest massage tables in the biz!one of those places that i hesitate to tell everyone about, but i would hate for them to not do well. 5 enthusiastic stars! shhhhh... :
my daughter and i had quality time today. this place is sooooo awsome. you definitely get your moneys worth.
best 20 bucks i ever spent! i would recommend to everybody my massage was great. only 20 dollars for one hour. the atmosphere was very clean and relaxing and the customer  service was great as well. check it out you will definitely be pleased.
lol got here by accident but 20 foot massage turned into full body, hot stone massage. i rarely give 5 stars nor do i tip big, but man, this takes the cake. 20 massage plus i added extra 20 because i was very happy with the results. amazing! ive been to other foot spas but theyre not as good as this one. its even far from where i live but ill definitely do the drive for this.
i love going here and im extremely picky about my massages as i have tried many places and have had more massages than i can count. i had tom last night and he was excellent. your body doesnt feel like it got beaten up after. i love the new owner byron. hes professional and a sweetheart! a breath of fresh air unlike the old owner who was extremely rude and so unprofessional! if you like a female then coco and summer are your go to. they are properly licensed and their massage therapists are also legit licensed with state board. the place is clean and up to code! you can also now get aromatherapy oils for your massage with no up charge. sweet! do support byron new business owner and his massage therapists!
lots of foot massage spas in town but this one so far was the best!!! if you want deep tissue massage, ask for steven. he always knows how to release my trouble spots. 20 for an hour, cant beat it at all. btw, they expected at least 10 tip as the price was cheap. 20 tip if you got an excellent massage :
im addicted to 3 things in life  sushi, a good wine, and asian foot spas.  ive been to so many in las vegas luckily, there is an abundance of them! and this is by far the best!lazy day foot spa has a nice, relaxing atmosphere.  it feels more like a spa than an asian foot massage parlor.  love it!
i was introduced to this place a little over a year ago. to start off, this place is magically delicious. in a professional and therapeutic way. to give full appreciation i will let you know i myself am a massage therapist, so i know whats good and whats not....this place is 5 stars in my eyes! i have been coming in once a week pretty regularly for a few months now and am walking out like gumby every single time. i see tom. tom is amazing. detail oriented, pressure is amazing and he knows just how to find the right spots and always goes above and beyond. i dont know the owners name, but he is super friendly and this may sound dumb but he actually remembers me each time i call for my appointment, which makes my day! and no, im not a crazy cat lady, i just have a serious appreciation for great customer service! anyways, if youre looking for an amazing and professional massage this is the place to go! to top it off, they are super affordable. now stop reading this damn review and make a trip to paradise, you wont regret it!
so my wife and i came in here last night with no appointment and asked for the private room which was 28hr. so we walk into the room and theres 2 beds instead of chairs that fold down. another thing here is they still do the foot massage but with no water soaking your feet because youre laying on a bed the whole time.  we really loved this massage and felt they did a great job. i think the quality was awesome and will be back for sure. and i dont mind spending the extra money for the effort these guys put in here. thank you for making me feel great you made my shoulder feel so much better and popped it back into place without me even asking you to focus on the spot.
i have been going to lazy sunday regularly for about 4 months. i brought my fiancee this time and we booked the private double vip room. annie and coco were terrific. i had worked with coco on my last 3 or 4 visits, but annie was very helpful to my fiancee who was having reflexology for the first time. i feel so energized yet relaxed after every session and recommend them highly!
ich hatte gerne noch mehr sterne vergeben, toller laden. super leckere speisen fruhstuck, gemutliche, bis ins detail geschmackvolle einrichtung, netes und freundliches personal.
the sud ouest breakfast sandwich i just had was amazing!  i got it with the home fries which were delicious.   crispy and smooth all at the same time.  found my new st henri breakfast place!
this cafe is full of natural light, vegetarian friendly options, and friendly staff.i have their classic breakfast once week and i always enjoy it. the food is reasonably priced and always very fresh. the decore is very inviting and well considered.
one of my favorite places in sthenri, i go here almost every week! the brunch is amazing love their eggs benedict and huevos rancheros, and they have some of the best brownies ive ever tasted. great place to study, and the staff is super friendly too.
irie natural health center makes the mmj certification process seamless. in the course of qualifying you you actually get free consultation on your ailments. this is not just a place to pay money and be certified . they take a holistic approach to helping you heal using natural products. they also give you a crash course on marijuana which includes characteristics of strains, means of delivery, dosage and so on. kudos to dr. johnson for caring to deliver health information.
kind of confusing to find but just follow the suite numbers and you will be ok. dr. johnson was great and made sure i understood the procedure and steps in obtaining my card. fast and easy as long as you have your paper work in order. wait was a little long but its ok.
my coworker said lets go to this new mexican grill that just opened up.. we went and i fell in love. great atmosphere, great people, great prices and most of all great food...  needless to say i am hooked, went back the next day lunch again... the carne asada is extremly delicious.
wow food is amazing! everything fresh and fish taco out of this world.. i dont mind waiting a little bit when food is made to order!! the tortillas are fresh and homemade beans and salsa..  dont forget to try the carmel stuffed churros!!  get there early the line is out the door...
i really enjoy this place each time i eat here!  as some reviewer had mentioned, the wait when it first opened was a bit long for this sort of establishment, but they just opened. bugs have to be worked out and it seems that that has happened. i have been here 4 times and the wait times to get food has defiantly improved. what hasnt changed is the quality of the food. the taco lights are my favorite!  they are basically a taco in butter lettuce with some other veggies. get for those trying to watch their waist line!
carne asada burrito is amazing! the meat is juicy and not chewy.  the veggies and chilies are an amazing touch, its so fresh tasting. :
very tasty!! love love love this place. staff are friendly, place was clean and the food was ahmazing! there is limited seating. but they have a few tables outside and also do togo ordering. its definitely worth any wait time.
had the albondigas today!! was very very .. very good! lots of spices and flavor! very authentic! i will definitely be coming back for more.
wow!  finally a great place to eat street tacos, homemade burros, and menudo!  the staff is very friendly and full of life too. today i noticed that the actually toast lol their burros. pretty cool. this place is very busy but they process orders quickly and get the food right out. i see more of this place in my future.
ive been here a couple of times the food is really good ive had the carne asada fries , carne asada torta , and the sonoran dog ... food is on point i will come back the location is good however its kinda small inside oh well ill just do take out
excellent food! the menu is small but everything we tried was amazing. i loved the fried fish tacos! in additional to the great food, the staff was very friendly. we will definitely be back.
great food, friendly service. pastor was delicious, so was the pollo asada quesadilla.
this place is a great new addition to casa grande.  the food is great; especially the street tacos!  this is not what id call traditional sonoran style mexican food as casa grande is known for, which i find to be a refreshing change.  great friendly service as well!
we came to eat here for dinner it was 2 of us from a poker night at ballys hotel, the inside was real nice and elegant and huge they are the same as the buca di beppo company, but offers a buffet as well and has a tequila taco bar right next to the cafe also owned by the same company which offers a variety of options,our server took great care of us, his name was omar i believe, he offered us 3 dollar draft beers which sounded like a steal, and recommended us there buca favorites we had the stuffed prosciutto chicken and ordered a side of fettuccine alfredo and it was superb, the service was spot on and our server had great energy and very outgoing,it was an overall fun atmosphere everyone was helpful im local so ill be back.
great food great service...i like the new buca look and next door to a tequila and taco bar..upscale...great place to duck in for a nice dinner and chill ballys
well this was my first time at this place you never really know what to expect at a italian  restaurant  for breakfast.  but me and girlfriend  and the mother in law took a chance. everything  was excellent  from start to finish . the hostess  was the bestes  i wish i got her name so i could give her some kudos in this review i got to buca around 10:00 am . our server was the best i have ever had,  his attitude  was amazing  you could tell he loved his job and was happy that you where  there . randy went out if his way to make sure our time at buca was a time to  remember . and boy was it . the food was outstanding i loved the fresh fruit and the french toast, i tip my hat to the chief. i cant stress enough  how good and so professional  our server randy was . he went way above  my expectations i have never had a server as good as him . my family and i will definitely  be returning  and we will be recommending buca to our friends and family.
very affordable breakfast. great customer service  accommodating attitude from host  staff. no issues being seated down, didnt have to wait long for a table.
good:1: they take regular buca coupons.2: excellent proseco for 34 a bottle.3: huge portion sizes.4: spacious setup.5: close to bathrooms often a challenge with casino restaurants.6: nice staff!bad:1: i am not a fan of italian fare: my wife is though.
i am so excited about this place after ive heard people raving about the gilbert location.  after eating breakfast here today i am not disappointed. the breakfast sandwich is delicious.  cinnamon roll my husband had...amazing!!! they just opened last friday so they are even giving out samples.  i got to try the bread and a salted carmel cupcake. wow! definitely impressed. the service is also very very good. everyone is so nice and friendly. they told me that at the end of the day all the leftover breads get donated so it doesnt get thrown away. they also have a basket wrapping station that i guess you can build your own breadgift  goodie basket with ribbon for gifts! this will definitely be replacing wildflower for me. this is in the home depot center next to the aaa building.
it was our first time here and the night manager christina was super nice and really sweet! she offered us a rewards card that she activated for us and when we told her it was our first time she gave us a free loaf of their house bread! paradise bakery has nothing on this place! i dont think ill be going back to paradise bakery after this...such great customer service, i havent had that in such a long time. we will definitely be back! :
what and enjoyable place to come and give your business to!!! the atmosphere is cozy and so clean.  the selections of baked sweets is bigger and better then your average bakery.  not to mention the food tastes good! but what really stood out to me is their service! everyone there starting from the manager is so lovely and professional in the way they run business.  they went above and beyond making sure my family and i have a pleasurable first experience with them.  i wish other companies would run their business this way.  too bad they dont have a location in dallas because i want to recommend this place to everyone i know.   never been to kneaders before till now but this scottsdale location sure left me with a great impression.
food is great. the price is good. if you cant find something good to eat here youre dumb and should just stay home.
i have tried kneaders in utah and was happy to see it here in az. they do not disappoint in the bakery dept, so much to choose from and very high quality. their rolls and bread are great to go for sunday dinner.
i had breakfast at a kneaders outside of salt lake city a couple of years ago  it was a cold and snowy morning, and we had time to grab a bite on the way to our meeting.  i ordered the french toast and coffee at the cashiers suggestion  it was amazing.been wanting to take my daughter there ever since  she loves french toast.great news  kneaders opened near our neighborhood!!!we went for dinner a few nights ago  i was crushed...crushed...that the french toast was only available from 711 a.m.i got a reuben, my daughter got the french dip.  good sandwiches!  we got some bakery items to take home  also very good try the asiago cheese bread!!!.so, finally...this morning...i got up early so we could get the french toast.we arrived.  the beautiful cashier smiled and welcomed us and asked what we wanted.french toast, please...and coffee for me, and french toast and water for the young lady.so, was it as good as i remembered, or did the sleepycoldsnowybeen up since 4 a.m. and hungry and needing coffee put a mystical glow on my memory?yes!  the french toast is wonderful and, all you can eat!  3 slices if you get it to go  it is made with their chunky cinnamon bread, and served with fresh whipped cream thick  almost like whipped butter, strawberry slices, and caramel syrup.  omg...wonderful!!!  my daughter agreed that i was not suffering from some sort false memory covering for the misery of that longago business trip  it was really that good.and, for you dads out there, the saturday before fathers day is dads eat free french toast day!  just dont get up too early  i dont want the line to be too long when we get there.lovin it!!!
wonderful reuben and chicken salad!  bread is awesome!  service was great.  well be back for sure.  please let me know when you get rewards cards.
had to make an unexpected stop at the aaa auto shop on my way out of town.  there was a little wait so the gal suggested i try kneaders.  she suggested the french toast, so i ordered that.  deeeelicious!!!!!everyone was lovely, the coffee was fantastic.  the notion of all you can eat was way out there for me since the first helping was so filling i couldnt imagine eating more.i left 5 hours after i had planned, but breakfast at kneaders made it worthwhile.  will definitely head back to try more.
this place is delicious! ive been here 3 times and hits the spot every time! the staff is all well trained and well mannered. very comfortable environment for the family or by yourself.
ive only recently discovered kneaders for lunch and it was delicious! i somehow walked by the pastries im still amazed that i was able to but managed to grab a sample of a cherry pastry next to the cashier : i ordered their turkey avocado on sourdough .... mmmmmmm.  they certainly dont skimp on portions so their half sandwich is definitely enough for me!
amazing fresh food great people great service bakery is incredible
this place is so good. we had turkey bacon avocado salads and sandwiches and the caprese salad. everything was super fresh and delicious. the cookies are to die for. definitely try the chocolate chip. the restaurant was really clean and the staff was quick and friendly! cant recommend it more!
by far the best bakeryeatery ive been too. far better than any of the competition! wholesome quality food! so happy we found this place we come here almost everyday for breakfast or lunch sometimes both.
i accidntally found this place when my car got towed to the aaa repair shop across the way.  the aaa guy recommended kneaders so we walked across the parking lot to kneaders.  what a treat.  the bakery case is extensiveso many beautiful choices.  the service was friendly and welcoming.  we had sandwich and soup combos and both were delicious.  the bread was fresh and tasty.  we were pleasantly surprised and then grabbed some treats to go.  i had a blt specialty sandwich called daves blt that also had cheese and onion on it.  really deliciouswould definitely get it again.  cant wait to go back.  need to explore the menu because there were so many things that we wanted to try.  i cant emphasize enough how fresh the food was.  also the place was clean and decorated in a very friendly way.  it just feels warm and inviting.
excellent food all around. altogether we ordered french toast, omelette, and two different sandwiches and soup and all surpassed our expectations especially when considering the price. completely shocked at the quality for the price when comparing to local competitors.
this is easily some of the best breakfast food ive ever had. it reminds me of a homemade and much better panera bread. and i really like panera. the smell when you walk in is so good that it instantly lifts your spirits and puts a smile on your face. i think i was smiling the entire time i was in the restaurant. i ordered the endless french toast and couldnt be happier. i  just moved here from michigan and i will be back at neaders very very soon. excellent friendly staff too!!
i have been going to kneaders for years, starting in st. george, ut. i was so excited when this location opened up. hands down, the best french toast you will ever have!
dr. c is the best dentist ... and his staff is so wonderful too. i used to be frustrated going to the dentist, because of the strange billing, rough and rude hygienists, or a dentist more interested in selling stuff then doing dentistry. well, these times are gone for me and my family. dr c  has a super modern office  i like the goaround xray : ... and a no nonsense and honest approach to dentistry. he always explains things understandably and has all the gadgets to show the problem areas on the big screen ... i am so relaxed during cleaning to the point that i almost fall asleep.  great dentist !oh .... address above has changed a while back. new office location of dr c is:3800 w ray rd. 17 chandler, az 85226phone is the same
the man has been doing it for years. simply the best.
my mom and i have been going to dr. casillas for years. the staff and the doctor are extremely friendly. whenever i call, they know who i am. goes to show they care about their clients. they are also pretty gentle on the teeth when they clean. ive been to other dentists and they were rough. i definitely recommend this dentist office!
tanya is an amazing yoga teacher with a great spirit and interesting class. i am a beginner at yoga and it really makes me want to take more yoga classes. i tried the vinyasa class and the gentle morning yoga. it was great for my muscle pain and increase my flexibility.
im amazed at how much my practice has grown since i started taking classes at yoga vieux montreal. the personal attention from the teachers means they can find and adjust an infinitesimal detail and completely change my alignment. youll realize immediately that they tanya and anastasia genuinely care about you  from the moment you walk into the studio until you reluctantly leave, they are focused on your experience and your personal growth. i told tanya early on that i wanted to get into a difficult pose  forearm stand  and she made it her mission to get me there, safely. im so happy i found this beautiful, sunny, welcoming studio. i cant imagine a better space or teachers.
ive been coming here for a few weeks now and yvm has become my favourite studio in town. ive taken classes with both tanya and anastasia and i can say that my practice has never been this very positively challenged before. on top of going through a few vinasa flows and common poses, the classes are very well structured for all levels and they are based on working your body towards achieving the strength and flexibility to do the days choice advanced peak posture. ...or at least get close to it! i left the yoga studio i was practicing at before because i felt like i was hitting a plateau and my practice wasnt expanding anymore. well, it looks like i found the right place. oh and the studio itself is beautiful and the instructors are very friendly. highly recommended!

highly trained physician and nurse; great location;  one stop shop for hair and aesthetics;  microneedling, facials, botox and more. nutritional counseling.  friendly, caring staff.
colleen is exceptionally knowledgeable and so sweet.  i felt so comfortable in her chair while receiving my service. i will be back!
i was immediately put as ease because both owners are highly trained health care providersan rn and a medical doctor who are also marriedand they explained that theyd also taken the time to get certified in the services they offer. colleen gave me a microneedling treatment. id had laser resurfacing year ago, and it was very painful and i had a red complexion for days. i decided to try microneedling because theres much less pain and no downtimeand it was great! colleen kept checking in with me during the procedure and explained what she was going to do before she did it. not only was it relatively painless just a little tenderness on the bridge of my nose, but i thought the results were better. i had no redness afterward, and i kept getting complements about how youthful my skin looked. im hookedscottsdale mobile medspa is my aesthetic service provider!
exceptional nutritional counseling on how to feel better by being aware of food allergies and how to shop without being preachy. the personal shopping experience was very eye opening and well worth it. a session with colleen both a nutritional culinary chef and a nurse helps cut through the promotional clutter in markets.  her cleansing program gives results in a week. both owners have the credentials tom is a physician to give me confidence that they know what they are doing and that the end goal is about my health.  i look forward to trying some of their other services, especially the lab review and skin care.
love this place and love kristy so much! i go to her for my brazilian wax and she is great! shes super sweet and really takes the time to get to know you! she makes me feel really comfortable! plus the waxed always turn out great!

my whole family2yo boy, 4yo girl, wife, and myself goes here for melina. we consistently love our haircuts. just recently, our daughter decided to cut her own hair and melina did a miracle job fixing it.
iced coffee machine and espresso machine. is this caffeine heaven?!? come here almost every day on my way to work. employees are super friendly and helpful. the place is always clean with short or no lines. plenty of parking so you dont have to park at the pump!
i have eaten at many pho places in phoenix with my fiance, and i would consider this place to be one of the better ones. the food and service we got were excellent. the staff were friendly, seated us quickly, and checked on us periodically to make sure we were doing fine throughout the meal. we started off with an order of spring rolls and egg rolls. i did not eat the egg rolls i have food allergies, but the spring rolls were very good. both the spring roll wrapper and the noodles texture were perfect  some places make tough, chewy spring rolls, but not this one  and the flavors were right on. we both got a different variation of the beef pho  i had steak and he had the special one with steak, meatballs, tripe, etc. this soup is legit. the broth was really nice  a good amount of fat and seasonings, but not too over the top. if you like your broth crystal clear, this is not the bowl for you. again, noodles were perfectly done and they give you plenty of them along with everything else. everything seemed to be very fresh and made with care. we plan to add this place to our regular rotation. dont be put off by the exterior its in the corner of a strip mall that has seen some better days! it is actually very clean and tastefully decorated inside. its a little far for us, but worth the bit of extra driving. well be back soon.
this place is so good! the service are so great! their pho is so good! the restaurant is very clean and friendly environment! must try this place! i will definitely come back here again. the spring rolls are so bomb! i love the peanut sauce that comes with it! well done phoenix pho! :
absolutely wonderful spicy beef noodle and more. i prefer eating here than other pho restaurant. the service is wonderful and fast.
so good great price its a must try! sort of in a hidden spot i guess you can say its like a hidden gem haha
very clean and bright, tucked away in a corner of the road would possibly pose a problem.  nice fresh vegetables, egg roll were decent, not amazing.  the pho was really great!  after all, that is what i came for.  excellent staff, checked on us often and made good menu suggestions.  my husband had the pork chops and rice, he enjoyed it and that came with soup also.  price is really reasonable.  not sure how phoenix pho ended up in glendale but we are happy to have them here!!!
the menu here is not as extensive as in the more established places like pho thanh or da vang, but enough of the standard favorites are listed to make this a good destination for lovers of vietnamese food. the food is tasty and very fresh with the requisite herbs and flavors. the restaurant itself is spacious and very clean and the staff members are very friendly and attentive. note that the restaurant is in the inner corner of a small commercial square, so that it is not readily visible from the road.
this was an excellent find! the broth in the pho was excellent. i had the steak and meatball pho and k had the bun. we shared spring rolls which were delicious and only 2.50. great deal. the pho was lightly seasoned and pleasant with regard to the broth. i didnt feel like too much salt was used and although i prefer my pho spicy i would have definitely enjoyed the broth without adding anything. noodles and meat was a good sized portion as was the bowl itself. for 6.50 it was a very good deal. k had the bun and wow... the broth was about the most flavorful ive ever had. there is definitely a fish component to the broth that i thought was fantastic. people who dont like fish sauce may not like this dishbroth but i was blown away with the flavor. little bit of a kick but nothing most couldnt handle. add to that the mom and pop feel and a very friendly staff, 5 stars is an easy review.
pretty nice little place. the restaurant is clean and the staff was friendly and attentive. i ordered the chicken pho and it was really good. its nice to have a pho place down the street from my house and its decently priced!
terrific beef  brisket pho!  very nice and clean restaurant, friendly staff....great vietnamese food.
great food.  excellent price.  the bowl was huge.  way more than i could eat in one sitting.  all the ingredients were fresh, and high quality.
there i was...looking for something different.  tired of the same ol, same old.  i wanted something new. then i saw it!  the restaurant was wellorganized and clean. it smelled of wonderful food.  i was greeted promptly and helped immediately with my togo order in spite of only having one waiter for 10 different groups of people. i ordered the pho of course, gabbed a bit with the staff and was offered a nice seat and a cold glass of ice water.  i loved how the staff was attentive and proactively assessed my wants and needs.  when i got home, my food was hot and fresh.  i had everything i needed to create my soup...my order had the thai basil, lime, bean sprouts, onions, tripe, tendon, meatball, rare beef, hoisin, sriracha and the noodles were perfect.  just talking about it only 2 hours later is making me hungry again!  heres one of the best parts...7.50!  thats it.  why not do something different?  give this place a try.i would and will go back to this superclean, superfriendly, supergoooooooood tasting restaurant again and again.  maybe even tonight.
best bun bo hue ive ever had in any restaurant! try the pho dac biet too! staff is all very friendly and the portions are amazing! loooooove!
everything was so fresh and delicious !! the service was excellent as well . highly recommend trying h1 if youre a seafood lover. well definitely be back :
i dont give a 5 very often but phoenix pho deserves it! as you first enter the space is well lit, bright and open. it is spotlessly clean and smells great. tables are not crowded and chairs are comfortable.the menu is easy to read and the staff was eager to explain any questions. be sure to get a take home menu for take out.best spring rolls in the valley...they are huge and the peanut sauce is plentiful for sure.we also got the combo pho soup...a pure delight in a vietnamese classic. broth is deep in flavor yet subtle in a very good way...hints of star anise and it comes with a unique chinese herb that makes the dish never had it before anywhere...the owner explained that it is expensive but needed for proper pho. the owner came to our table and it is clear he take great pride in his pho and for very good reason. best i have had and i have many.we will be back which is the greatest compliment i can give. you must try this gem...the best came at the end...the bill...so reasonable for what we were served...a 3rd lower than i expected. what a great find.treat yourself to a real fine asian meal and dining experience.
this place is delicious and the staff is tons of fun. the restaurant is small and beautiful on the inside. pho is one of my favorite foods and this place has my favorite broth, hands down. i am addicted to the pho ga and my husband loves the bun cha gio thit nurong b3. both are delicious. we probably eat here at least once a week.
the pho dac biet is delicious! for the amount of food they serve, it never fails to make me so full! the staff feels like family and are always very welcoming and sweet, will be a regular.
best pho ive ever had. the pho dac biet is so delicious.  the portions are great as well. my guilty pleasure food every week after a long day at work with my foodsidekick cindy hahaha
it is a nice place with good rice noodle. i prefer the spicy beef rice noodle! and its very cheap!
new restaurant in the area worth a visit. clean dining room  restrooms, welcoming atmosphere, delicious food. i will be back! had the pho ga and thoroughly enjoyed every bite.
excellent food and service! was driving in from southern ca and yelp reviews guided us here! pho was awesome and i was not disappointed! prices were very reasonable too! will come back when we visit az again!!!!
decided to try a new pho restaurant, i must say that i was impressed. the food was amazing, the service was just as impressive eizel did a great job. we were immediately greeted and felt welcome. the spring rolls are delicious, and of course the pho was amazing!!!! highly recommend it and we will defiantly be returning.
first time trying pho. they where great, and help explain everything to us. the pho was amazing. we will definitely be back to try more.
super delicious and a great atmosphere..the girl that waited on us was amazing and friendly and i wouldnt hesitate to go back.
friendly service. beverages offered during extreme heat.  great pedicure, attention to toe detail. massage was excellent. location is clean and nicely decorated.  recommending to everyone. ill be back often.
such a wonderful atmosphere. relaxing with a complimentary beverage. french pedi done perfectly.
i love this place! very reasonable prices and they will spoil you! ask for linda shes the best!
brought my 3 daughters here for some much needed mommy daughter time. no wait on the veterans day holiday. they allowed my girls to be in control of the remote so they were able to watch cartoons. they loved the personalized attention. especially with the drinks. more expensive than my normal place by 12 but well worth it as hot stones were included in the basic pedi, unlike my usual place. close to home, clean and they use the liners in the pedi bath and fresh clean tools. love it. great experience.
this is by far the best nail salon in valley!!! vincent and his team always do an awesome job and i always get compliments on my nails! come let them take care of you!!!
great fun and friendly atmosphere!! sorry the last reviewer was unimpressed, my experience was 1000 better, very attentive servers, great food! my server was excellent, tabitha was on the ball and never dropped it!! ill be back and bring friends!! i recommend the quesadilla burger, wings and margaritas!! 43 tequilas to choose from is icing on the cake!!
ballys casino has a brand new mexican restaurant.  we got to check it out on its 2nd day opened.  they have a very friendly staff.  we ordered house made guacamole.  they bring a cart up to your table and make it fresh in front of you.  excellent avocados and freshly made chips.  this place has over 43 different tequilas at the bar.  if you want to come here for just drinks, this a worthy spot.  you can drink tequila straight up or enjoy an interesting list of drink creations.  the hours are noon  6am everyday.  happy hour 35pm and 10pmmidnight where tacos are just 2.00!  so people in vegas now have a quality restaurant to eat at for late night food.  my friend ordered the shrimp salad and i got the steak fajitas.  the fajitas were cooked great, served with sour cream, pico, guacamole, black beans and tortillas.  they add certain spices to tweak the flavor of the dish.  tequila taqueria is a small new spot inside ballys with access to great tequila and mexican dishes, this spot for sure is a winner.  i live in texas where we eat mexican food all the time and i would highly recommend this spot.
the food is awesome. happy hour 2 tacos a deal you cant pass up and theyre delicious! the margaritas are ok. i had the margarita saint rita and the south of the border margarita which was pretty good. but the 2 tacos and the mexican corn were delicious!! squeeze some lime on those suckers, oh boy! the service lacks a little bit at busy times but the manager is very nice and on top of everything. they have happy hour sunday through thursday from 3 to 5pm and 10pm to midnight. stop in and get the  2 tacos you wont be disappointed. this is the second time ive been here and definitely will be returning.
el magnifico  phenomenal burgers what makes this place unique is the spices they use and the way they flavor their meats. i ordered the taqueria burger late on a saturday,  and the only drawback was that it took a while for it to come. a while meaning i opened up my laptop and almost completed an online traffic school class before my food arived. in their defense, they had only been open a few days, and they were still getting the schedule and menu down, and probably didnt anticipate a vegas late night traffic surge. the manager personally came over and let us know the situation,  and took care of us.our waitress was cy, and she was very nice, she brought us some complementary snacks to compensate for the wait as well, now it was like thanksgiving. i was starving and the extra food was very appreciated,  but it was their attitude about it, that turned me into a repeat customer.the food was so tasty i came back the following day to try the mahi tacos. nina, my new waitress subbed out a few ingredients for avocado and their chipotle mayonnaise. obviously it took longer,  but i wanted them custom made.ambience:it is vegas so of course there was a big screen tv with the playoffs in the background.  this is not fast food, but if you like authentic mexican food, you may enjoy this restaurant. highly recommended.
great new bar in ballys next to the new buca restaurant...43 tequilas. cant beat that....great menu items...
i love the food! chorizo quesadilla are amazing! i also recommend the california rita, it has muddled avacado, or the cc margarita its very refreshing. i work here and i enjoy eating the food. ask to sit with me!
great steak and chilaquiles for breakfast, but you can have anytime during the day!!!
really good, spicy chicken tacos. guacamole is flavorful. good tequila selection. open until 6am, so it is a good late night stop.they seemed more slammed than normal when i went, which led to the servers providing the best service possible and the effort showed, but things were a little sluggish. not faulting them, they did their best with whatever cards they were dealt.the cilantro on the tacos was fresh and crisp, a big selling point for me and a lot better than shredded cabbage and radish like one place that will not be named.i wish they had the typical chips  salsa to start out with, but no biggie. will definitely go back!
amazing amazing amazing! during my trip to vegas, we came here many times. the chef shay spelling might be off was amazing. i have a gluten and dairy allergy and every time she came out to ensure what i ordered was safe for me to eat! so sweet and the food amazing!  im so glad we found this restaurant! gluten free and dairy free. no problem!
we went in at 2:30am and asked the waitress for vegetarian options and she got the chef to talk to us, which was amazing. the chef asked about our preferences and restrictions and explained how they make all the dishes. it was the best mexican food ive ever had, not greasy or heavy but very satisfying. the green enchiladas and veggie quesadilla are awesome!
service 5 stars...great job carissa!!!food 5 stars...nacho grande epic and chicken tacos!atmosphere 5 stars...great decor and barthis place is a vegas gem hidden in balleys casino! by far one of the best values in vegas and portions fit for a king and queen!!check out the photo of my nacho picture!! you wont  be disappointed!
best food weve had so far. very god flavor generous portions. the carne assad tacos were very good. after 6 meals here in vegas well come back. not too expensive but great food.
jason was an awesome bartender. he made us custom drinks and was extremely knowledgeable, as well as entertaining. if this guy is working, make sure you stop in.
we loved this place fast service and outstanding food served nicely. it was a bit out of the way but worth the walk!
i just had a great meal at tequila taqueria.  brenda was my waitress she is exceptional in every way.   she made excellent recommendations and made my experience delightful!  she also happens to be beautiful which only added to my dining pleasure! brensa and the restaurant certainly earned 5 stars!
i ordered the carnitas tacosthey were pretty good but they needed spicier salsa.the highlight of the night was brian the bartender. he was super friendly and attentive and made sure we were taken care of.thank you brian! :
i really loved the pedicure this place gave me!  my friend took me for my birthday, and what a treat it was. they were very professional and the place was super clean. i liked that the chairs arent right in the window of the store making you feel awkward as every one can watch you on display getting a pedicure. their chairs are actually back a room out of sight. they used a really nice scrub on my legs for exfoliation.  they also applied a clay like substance that had menthol and felt amazing when they added the hot towels. they also spent a lot of time removing dead skin and making my feet look healthy.  they go above and beyond to really give the spa experience.  the nails looked great and they actually know how to do nice, quality designs. nothing worse than a good pedi, and they ruin it with a crappy design. mine were beautiful!! check out the pic. i will be back.  this place is a little more pricey, but worth the extra money. like they say, you get what you pay for.
my friend recommended me this place! yumi did my manicure and pedicure, she is very sweet and creative too. i really love her and my new nails design!! got lots of compliments..... definitely back to see her and her partner jaime again soon!!
yumi does the most prettiest manicures and awesome pedicures! make sure to look for her!
jamie is so amazing and talented! i only go to her to get my nails done. i always bring in photos of japanese or korean nail designs that i like and she can create it just like the photos but even better. if you want fabulous nails then go to her.  make sure to make an appointment with her and not just walk in. getting beautiful nails takes time.
i was beyond needing a pedicure, and yumi took good care of me. she explained their 20 off special for the month of june, and showed me their menu of services. water temperature was perfect, massage chair was amazing, and the deluxe pedi that i opted for was worth it, and so relaxing. my feet and calves look and feel so much better. i opted for a simple one color polish, but i was shown photos of their work and next time im definitely choosing a fancy design in gel. 5 stars and two thumb toes up!
i found a very lovely nail salon called nail story. the owner jamie is a very pleasant gal! a couple of her nail experts are yumi and grace, both wanting to serve your needs with expertise and efficient service. i recommend!!
i went with my daughter and mother and we had such a good time with jamie and yumi. they both were very pleasant and easy to talk to. jamie did my nails and did such an amazing job. she used free hand and has such a natural talent. my nails have never looked so amazing! i will definitely be going back!
what a cozy place to be..! i only go to this shop for my nails and never disappointed. all my coworkers love my nails,too!!!  every single technician got talented and friendly.  thanks everyone who works at the shop for making me happy all the time. you guys are the best!!!!
the owner was very sweet. i showed her a picture of the gradient style i wanted for my nails. she matched the color and design very well. she also recommended which stone to put on my nails.the place is also very clean and they use new tools everytime. i would suggest calling in before you come in because i had to wait an hour when i walked in without an appointment.
love this place!  good quality products, very professional and clean. jamie and yumi are the best!
im love getting my mani and pedi by jamie and yumi. they are amazing! make sure to make appointments.
i love nail story. they are very kind,professional and good at designs. i couldnt find any nail places to do any new trendy designs or what i want if i bring the picture in but at the nail story..they know exactly what they are doing and even make it better than the picture that i bring to them. i am so impressed and glad found this place in town.ill say its the best nail place in town.they made me feel so comfortable and any designs that i have in my mind..i feel really comfortable to ask them to do it. no bs lol
went through yelp to find this new gem. i dont get my nails done often because as a waitress its a pain in the butt if it chips and whatnot. ive been trying gel nails for a bit and i love them.. no chipping, no waiting to dry. oh technology now days : anywho yumi did my nails this time and i love them! simple yet fashionable, leveled, beautiful! also an extra plus, yumi is very nice and the rest of the staff is really considerate. id check them out if i were you.oh and also i didnt personally get art done on my nails but yumi and these cute intricate designs on her two fingers. after i saw that i was pretty sure she could handle we you asked to be done. ill definitely be going back!
i came here with a devastating nail job from another place i was in a hurry to get to airport for a flight and i came here looking for a quick and good fix! trinh was amazing she was super friendly and very attentive to me. she also showed compassion for the atrocious job the previous person had done at another nail salon she offered to fix them the best she could! she was very gentle and very talkative i really enjoyed her chatter i was super stressed and sad and she was awesome! the nails came out beautiful compared to what they were before i wanted an almond  shape nail with burgundy matte gel polish and a gold rhinestone design she gave me exactly what i asked for for a great price! i will definitely be back to see her she did a wonderful job! i will definitely recommend this place to my friends  thanks trinh!
yumi was so nice, took her time and did a fabulous job! i will most definitely be back. she gave me an amazing gel polish manicure and finished with a paraffin dip. the salon is clean and the decor is cute. 5 stars!
this place is extremely clean and professional. i used to be a manicurist for 9 years and im extremely picky.  i had jamie did my gel mani and pedi, a fabulous job.  no complaints whatsoever.  my gel mani lasts for 3 weeks.  so happy and will always be coming here.
so loving jamie yumi  nailstory. jamie is on point with design ideas. she take her time with you. she listens to your ideas, adds her artistic flare and final design is better than you could have imagined! the nail story is clean and all staff are always friendly and helpful. nail story has the largest selection of regular and gel polish. so looking forward to my next visit at nail story !!!
i was searching thru yelp looking for a place to get a mani pedi while my son was at baseball.  a few of the salons near his field got bad reviews so i kept looking.  i found nail story and it had very good reviews so i booked an appointment.  yumi did both my mani and pedi and she was fabulous.  she took her time and did a great job, and i am picky.  all of the staff was very friendly and i would definitely go back.  i passed on the gel nails this time, but im thinking i may try it next time around.  definitely worth the money!
ive gone to a few nail places and i must say that this new spot is my favorite.  inside the atmosphere is tidy and everyone that works there is really friendly.  both times ive been here theyve done my nails exactly how i wanted.  their prices are reasonable for their services and they always go above and beyond to make sure their customer is satisfied.  theyre all talented in doing all the extra nail designs or gel extensions which seem to be the new alternative for acrylic.
very clean and i love how up to date the technology and gels are. i was surprised by how they dipped my hands in wax and wrapped them in hot towels. it was a nice change from the usual lotion and hand massage. i will be coming here again. :
after all the wonderful reviews about nail story and spa, i and my friend decided to give a try.  the price was very reasonable.  but the service and courtesy of the staff was way beyond reasonable.  every staff was very friendly and their design art skill was the best.  jamie and jenny have so many design ideas and can give you different options and recommendations.  nail story has thousands of design stickers, stones and plenty of design experience, whatever design you have in mind, they can do that perfectly.  inside of the salon is unique and very cozy.  it has several wall paintings which you dont find anywhere else.  you really got to try this nail slaon. nail story is definitely the best nail salon in town especially if you are looking to have a unique and beautiful design to be done on your nails. ^^
top notch glass guy, fast and efficient! will be definitely useing him for all my future repairs :
excellent and fast glass replacement! he was on time and uses high quality glass. the only company i will use for all my glass replacements.
they did a great job! on time, professional, courteous, and thorough.
i hired this company 4th time now to do my carpet cleaning. i have a house with pets and sometimes they are pretty messy. they use real steamers and do offer extra cleaning with enzymes if you have pets. each time they did a very good job of getting stains and smell out.
i have used them for several years and they always do a great job for us.  they are very prompt, thorough, and professional.  i have even referred my neighbor to them who had lipstick all over her floor from a child and they were able to get that out!  will continue using.
love this company and values!  great shirts and hats with excellent customer service and very quick turn around time on orders!  sayetoli
i love the shirts and hats!  the colors and designs are great and most importantly the meaning  saying yes to health, happiness, and life.
just ordered my second sayetoli shirt today! a friend turned me onto this site after i saw him wearing the bike tee. great quality fabric; really comfortable; great price too. and the designs are awesome! keep up the good work and inspiration.
hectors moving is great!! my parents have used them for years and i recently moved to the area. we needed to move some furniture around from a storage unit to 2 homes. they were awesome. they were there early and worked very fast for a very affordable price. i recommend them to anyone and will definitely be using them again!
we have used hectors moving service more than 5 times over the years.  they moved my motherinlaw twice, my husbands office twice and my husband and i to two houses. they are amazing.  always on time, very fast and hard workers, and a very reasonable rate.  never an add on or unexpected charge just a straight hourly rate.  look no further, use hector!
hector and his team have moved me twice. both times the experience was amazing. hes got the equipment trucks, pads, everything to make a move successful. his movers are professional and really seem to care about getting the job done and getting it done right. theyve always been on time, flexible, fast and ive had zero damage issues! i was sick prior to my last move and didnt get a few things packed and his guys packed my kitchen including my china while they loaded up the truck and all arrive fully intact with no breakage! 5 stars for hector and his team.

sean bob was the best. he helped us find a rental in no time. he listened to what we were looking for, and managed to find every available place that fit the bill.he is super friendly, and his witty banter helps make the viewing property process less annoying and awkward. at the end, he helped us rate our top choices and decide the one we really wanted. he didnt stop at that though, he then helped us through the paperwork and applications, even sending me screen shots of how to fill out each form. he is truly committed to helping people find the best place for them, and he does it in a way that makes you feel comfortable and positive that you made the right choice.
sean is a great realtor with wonderful communication skills. he is always ready to show properties at the drop of a hat. i spent a lot of time with sean where he helped me find exactly what i was looking for. he also answers his phone all hours of the day or night. i would recommend him to anyone in the las vegas area, looking for a real estate agent.
sean is such a pleasure to work with. he is personable, reliable, and gives you complete one on one attention when looking for a home. we truly appreciated that he took the time to get to know us as people while finding the best home for us! seans work ethic is unmatched; he makes himself available, is never late, and has excellent turn around time in phone calls and emails. i would highly recommend sean you will not be disappointed!
i was referred to sean from a guest of mine from work. i was just calling to ask some questions about new and resale homes. sean always picked up the phone or called back very quickly to answer my questions. its nice to see a friendly realtor who cares about helping people. i have had a few run ins with other realtors that have that  if you are not ready to buy a house dont bother me. i get we all need to pay our bills but taking care of people will help your business out in the long run. after a few discussions i have house in escrow. sean has done a great job. real good honest guy. i will be referring him!!!
sean was amazing to work with  incredibly patient and flexible. he was always on time and really went out of his way to make himself available to us while we searched for our home. he went above and beyond to make sure that all of our needs were met and we couldnt be happier with the outcome. we would highly recommend!!
sean was super helpful and trustworthy.  i was completely lost when i started my search, and sean was able to help me narrow down exactly what i wanted.  he knows the area really well.  i found a great little place in a perfect location, and everything went surprisingly smooth!  i would definitely recommend him to my friends.
sean went out of his way to show me a commercial real estate location even though thats not his area of business. upon liking the location he then put me in contact with a commercial real estate agent who has been more than helpful.  he still calls to make sure everything is going ok with with the agent he set me up with.  sean has really gone above and beyond with helping me and when it comes time to find a place to rent or a house to buy, hell be the first guy i call! 55
sushi takashi is located in the former short lived hiromaru ramen joint. but, they have changed the interior completely, with dark sexy colors and wood, cool booths, and a wide sushi bar. after taking a seat at the bar, i met the man himself, chef takashi, who is a friendly and cool person. while they do have an a la carte menu, i was more interested in the shiny, laminated menu that had some more unique options. on one side contained a 10 course and 12 course menu. and on the other side, a combo menu with a whole lot of options including a bottomless one, a roll one, a never ending salmon bowl, and a quick togo bento. they also have an 80 ayce option. i decided to go with the 12 course.this was interesting because it wasnt like a traditional kaiseki, where the portions are super small. the value at takashis is better than most of the izakayas in the valley. and what else is interesting is that you modify the options on the course menu as you see fit.before the courses began, they brought out some mini japanese crackers to snack on. they were good.the first course was the the garlic edamame. the spices were really good and bright. and the edamame had a vibrant color.the next course was the tuna carpaccio. the fish quality was excellent and it went well with soy dressing that had yuzu in it.next came the salad. i think that i made a great combo with the soba noodle and salmon skin options. the noodles were perfectly cooked and the salmon skin had a great texture to them. i enjoyed the tanginess of the mayo dressing that they used to bring everything together.the meat dish came out next. i ordered the beef teriyaki. this was a simplified version of grilled beef that was seasoned lightly. the beef was of very good quality, and was cooked to a spoton medium rare. the sauce was kept on the light side, and helped amplify the taste of the beef, rather than mask it as some other spots tend to do.the chef also gave me a taste of the king crab that was available. you dont normally see this item in most sushi restaurants, and i appreciated that fact.the next course was the roll course, in which you can choose from the menu any one of specialty rolls on the menu. i chose the king club roll, which is their king crab made into a roll with avocado. what i noticed immediately was that their rice is cooked perfectly, not too hard or soft, and i personally dont like a too strong of a vinegar taste, and i liked that takashis was more neutralsweet, because that gives it more of a natural taste to the rice. seriously, king crab and avocado? now thats what im talking about!next course was the chicken, and i chose the karage. i liked the fact that the chicken were piping hot!! a lot of sushi restaurants in vegas can learn a thing or two from takashi about making their karage more hot.next the seafood course came, and i picked the oysters. six large oysters were brought out in this asian mignonette style sauce. they were fresh and sweet. i literally could have eaten about 50 of these. they were amazing. next, the sukiyaki came out. it came with a generous amount of beef, and it was fun eating it with the noodles, onions, and scallions. the baked dish was next so what looked like a dynamite baked roll came out and was very tasty as well.my nigiri dish came out afterwards and i can say that i am impressed with the high quality of the fish they are using here. its higher than goyemons and more like yummy grills on lake mead not eastern ave!!. the rice was perfect and everything just went really well together.the soup course then came. i ordered the creamy white stew. looking back, i would have probably chosen the miso. i liked the earthiness of the stew, but it wasnt really my cup of tea.chef takashi wanted me to try their tuna belly before my last course as a gesture of their grand opening. once again, they are using high quality fish, and they are thick slices. mikey likes it!my last course came out which was the dessert course. i ordered the tempura ice cream. the ice cream was exquisite, and the batter was very neutral tasting, which highlighted the ice cream.throughout the evening, what i realized was that i never felt rushed throughout the evening. the service was awesome, even though its a brand new restaurant. it has actually been a really long time since ive felt just really comfortable eating at a sushi restaurant. my impression was that i was eating at a strip highend sushi restaurant, without having to pay those overpriced, exorbitant prices that those restaurants on the strip usually command. even though they have just opened, if they are able to maintain the quality, this would be one of my favorite sushi restaurants in las vegas. great value, great quality, great service, great ambiance, thats all you can really ask for. im kinda over the ayce thing, so im looking for a bit more, and sushi takashi delivers!
the very first thing to say about sushi takashi is that the food is very, very good.  the food is as good as any sushi restaurant on the strip, except you dont have to go to a hotel and pay the expensive price!sushi takashi offers a variety of japanese food, not only sushi.  there are a wide range of desserts shaved ice and tempura ice cream as well as other japanese cuisine, like sukiyaki and curry.there is an allyoucan eat option for around seventy dollars, but the course options are of variegated choices while still very filling.  i tried the tencourse sushi dinner, and it was more than enough food.  my particular favourite was the scallop carpaccio.  it was topped with masago, a tangy sauce, a very thin lemon slice, and garnished with a small bit of cilantro.  the tangy lemon and sauce blended very nicely with the rich, buttery scallop.the quality and variety of food is great, but i think the food could be served in a more timely fashioni want plenty of time to wolf it down!overall, i felt that the restaurant gave me the upper handi could enjoy highquality sushi and japanese food without going to the strip.  it was also an interesting, different option than the traditional allyoucan eat plus theres no time limit!
this is a new sushi restaurant that my fiancee and i will definitely be coming back to!  fresh sashimi is hard to come by in the desert, and sushi takashi definitely delivers!  the menu items are unique and delish, but most of all fresh!  even the normal cooked ebi nigiri tasted amazing dats how you know!.  a great change of pace from the typical ayce sushi place wthe same stuff.  kawika and chef takashi provided outstanding service and great recommendations!  mahalo!  cant wait to return and try the amaebi and uni! :d
this may be our new sushi spot!!!! very cute place with fresh fish! everything tastes delicious and was priced right. service was great as well! will be back!
probably the best japanese restaurant in town.went here because my friend recommended the place. definitely a great place! sashimi is so fresh! and i cant really say anything negative about the rest of the food we got. the place is nice too and has a great ambiance. without a doubt. its a must go place!!!demu
omg this place is so awesome. i got the 12 course meal for 39.99. literally the best japanese food and sushi i have ever had. the food they give you is well over 40 worth and you can pack it up to go! everything tasted so amazing i cannot even put it into words so i have attached a plethora of pictures!
absolutely amazing,  this place a must visit spot that serves the best sushi by takashi.  worth every penny...reasonable price.  amazing fresh sushisashimi in vegas for sure!
fantastic restaurant.  my wife took me here a few days ago to celebrate an anniversary.  this is now my favorite japanese restaurant in las vegas.  everything was exceptional.  service, decor, food quality, price ...  i will be back to sushi takashi many times.
the 12 course prefix was excellent! plenty of food and every course was delicious in its own way. kawika was great. highly recommend.
i think that is best japanese restaurant in lasvegas.  quality.service price. amount of servings. .....im really satisfied with everything. youll not be disappointed. .....fantastic! !!!!!!
by far the best sushi place in town !!!! thanks again takashi!!! amazing atmosphere, amazing food, amazing service..  will be back again soon.
ive been to many sushi restaurants in my life just like everyone. rarely do i find one that is so delicious, fresh and welcoming !sushi takashi is quaint and lovely. there is the traditional sushi bar and a few tables. in the rear of the restaurant are really cool, private booths! i loved the ambiance.the waiters were always checking on us and filling up waters and delivering drinks nonstop. i never felt rushed ! so refreshing. i ordered the garlic edamame and it had amazing toasted garlic flavor. we also ordered a few specialty rolls custom designed by chef takashi ! they were flavorful, fresh and so ridiculously tasty! we asked for heat and he brought it! one of my friends had uni and it was the most generous portion ive ever seen. fresh fresh fresh !!cant wait to return !thank you darryl, yui and roxie for introducing me to takashi !
first visit and feel so obliged to give my review right away. great variety in the menu, yummy blend of traditional and modern japanese culinary cooking, smiling staff so super attentive to clients and above all, the personalized, hands on preparation and supervision of chef takashi himself. need you go anywhere else?
lots of options, decide carefully. excellent sashimi!!! nagoya was one of the best sushis i ever tasted. everything else and service was top notch for what you r paying... if u like or wanna try japanese food, give this place a chance.just had the 12 course meal. all was good except burger which was average.  make sure you are at least two or more to order 1012 course meal. awesome service, no need to remove a star for average burger, maybe its me:
fresh, friendly, and great environment is the impressions i had after my first visit at sushi takashi japanese restaurant.  i was sitting at the bar and found out both chefs are japanese with total of half century experience.  i was well taken cared by the owner chef nakamura san.  the set course is a must have.  it consist of varieties of baked, steamed, raw, grilled, fried traditional japanese dishes.i highly recommend the oyster, uni, and seasonal fresh fish that chef recommends.  the price is reasonable as they only opened for a month and half.  im sure pretty soon there will be a line waiting at the door.  thumbs up with five stars!
just tried this place for the first time. everything was amazing! the atmosphere and service is great, food is delicious, quality is amazing and portions are more than enough food. steak roll and the big fantasy are to die for!! super white was so fresh and the largest portion ive seen before! i loved iti will be coming back for sure!
experience counts. chef takashi, boy i was waiting for this visit for a long time and the joy of finally putting in your food in my mouth... thank god im still alive. will recommend this place to anyone thats seeking for high quality sushi. best in vegas for sure.
amongst all the poor to mediocre sushi restaurants that pop up in the valley, once in a blue moon a really good sushi spot will pop out and stand out from the rest. thats sushi takashi. me and a buddy came here after hearing about their happy hour deal through vegas eater. and we werent disappointed!we arrived pretty late about 1.5 hours before their closing time and after reviewing both their regular and happy hour menus, ordered:chicken karage hhhalf order scallop yum yumhhhalf order spicy tuna hh4 piece nigiri1 piece of the italian nigiritouch and go dinner comes w1 half order special roll..we got the teriyaki salmon  spicy yakiniku, and tempura loouooll..to make this as short and straight to the point as possible, every piece of fish was perfectly portion sized cut generous sized and most of all very fresh. to match our meal, the owner, was equally as generous. we had made a mistake ordering only 1 italian nigiri and upon placing a second order, he gave it to us for free. and then he gave us an extra piece of nigiri with our 4 piece order, and made all our half order rolls, full orders. wow talk about service!the staff was also all very nice and attentive to us as well, i dont think i ever seen my glass only half full after coming to takashi im now an optimist. the servers always made sure our drinks were completely filled and we had everything we needed.the salmon teriyaki and our chicken karage was very moist! this was something that actually really took me by surprise since ive never been to a restaurant that doesnt over cook these 2 items dry. the yakiniku was really good and interesting, sort of reminded us both of pizza.. and the italian nigiri was a smooth and tasteful blend of what i think was pesto and ikira on top of the lightly seared fish and had a very pleasant and juicy flavor... overall based on my reactions after our first time to sushi takashi?.. a well deserved 5 stars!
mr nakamura always serves great japanese food. i been fan of his cooking since he was a executive chef at xtreme sushi at southern highlands. im going to enjoy 10 course sushi dinner 2nd time at this restaurant!
i got the 10 course sushi dinner for 29.95service 55they were very patient with us and recommended their popular items. they refilled our drinks without us asking and i like how they always cleared our table with our plates once we finished one of the courses. usually sushi places are loud and overwhelming, but this restaurant had an appeasing environment, which i enjoy very much.food 45the food was delicious! the carpaccio is heavenly! i got the yellowtail carpaccio and it vanishes in your mouth with yummy flavors. i got the creamy corn soup and it exceeded my expectations by far, one of the best corn soups i had in my life. the salmon bowl wasnt one of my favorites, just cause the salmon wasnt as flavorful and juicy like the other items on the menu. make sure if you do the 10 or 12 course sushi dinners, allow yourself to stay at the restaurant for 12 hours! it takes time to prepare each course!
super fresh  authentic!i love their uni bowl!they have great deals after 10 pm every day. must try! :
this place was great!! we tried the 12 course meal for 40 and every course was delicious! service was outstanding. the servers were always checking on us, replacing plates and refilling our water. the chef even sent out some cool candies and snacks for our son, so nice of him. will def come back again! and to the guy complaining about it being too much food, are you crazy?! thats like complaining about getting paid too much or a buffet having too many selections. just plain crazy especially since they box left overs for you to take home.
best value ever!!we came here for the first time saturday night and tried the 10 course meal for 29.95.  boy, that was a lot of food!  super white tuna carpaccio: very fresh and goodsoba salad: perfectly cooked soba noodle and it has tasty mayo dressing on.teriyaki chicken: good. tempura: i should have got karage!!  4pc nigiri: fish was fresh and good. i happened to get a shrimp nigiri which i didnt want, but i should have told the server  my bad.dragon roll: i picked this one from takashis signature rolls.miso soup: it was pretty thin and i couldnt taste much of miso...azuki ice cream: i picked this one over my usual green tea.. very tasty.. at this point, it was almost miracle i was able to finish ice cream!!service was good and chef takashi is fun to talk to!we will definitely come back soon!!
man. chef takashi used to work at xtreme sushi in southern highlands and then he left, with unknown whereabouts. i was so depressed. lo and behold, he opened up his own sushi spot and i just now found it...this place is amazing!! fresh fish, high quality, awesome space and very trendy!  i will now be a regular here and am so glad to find this place. kabuto may be in a league of its own, but for quality versus price, this place is hands down a top competitor. the octopus lightly battered was fantastic, the sashimi plate was fresh and delicious, the linda roll, which is a former roll chef takashi created for me at a former place was exactly how i remembered, perfect. you will definitely want to check this place out!!
yelp it today and sushi takashi ture out to be one of the best sushi restaurant i have eaten the ingreatent is so fresh its so food the fish will melt in your mouth. : the price is really good and the owner and head chief is a really cool guy and easy going person. will come back for sure next time im in town.
i have been to this place for the third time, each time was not a disappointment. if you know sushi, you have to give this place a try. i recommend getting the 3 rolls special which you can share. great deal!! must try!!!
we came for dinner wanting to try sukiyaki, and we were very impressed with everything!! the service, the quality of food, and also the price, all very good. we had a very good time, amd will be back again!
yummy in my tummy when in vegaaaaa!their seating booth area is shaped as half wine barrels  pretty neat!  service was attentive and nice!food for happy hours was happening!  i love their salmon sashimi carpaccio.  the vinegar sauce with the smooth textured salmon, was delicious.  do order up.  also, the sprinkled salt asparagus, was swell and crisp to my liking.  eat it if you need some veggie in your dietary system. they have a lot of variety on their menu to choose from.  i like the raw oysters.  it was refreshing for the hot weather vegas  if you go during the summer heat.bathrooms were a change of theme.  instead of a standard or japanese styled themed restroom, it was french themed with classical music played in the background.  interesting. i got my sashimi sushi game on here and enjoyed the restaurant entirely.
had my prebirthday party here  another wonderful experience! :food are fantastic as always! chef takashi is super kind. always gives kids japanese cookie as gift. all the staffs there are very nice  friendly. they brought me a surprise birthday dessert once they knew we were celebrating. so sweet!
i have no words for how amazing this restaurant is. salmon overflow is a giant bowl of salmon sashimi. it is nonsensically good. the 12 course dinner is probably slightly too much food, but its all amazing so i am not sure why you would complain about that. will come back here any time we are in vegas.
awesome service, everyone is so friendly and the chef is as well. been twice and got the 12 course tasting each time.
great food, great service and great atmosphere! my advise is to make the ordering easy on yourself and go with the waiters choice! max was our waiter and he was great!! we had a great dinner and well be back again!
we love takashi and is so glad hes back in vegas.  my hubby and i missed him greatly and often wondered where we went after he left extreme sushi at southern highlands.great food and restaurant.  rolls are small because hes not trying to fill you up with rice.  ponzu sauces doesnt drown your rolls; just the perfect amount for flavor.  just little mindful things like that is why we love it that hes got his own place.the carpaccio garlic sauces are awesome.  oysters were fresh and i tried the steak roll and loved it.  next time we will give his semi fixed menu a try.
my girlfriend brought me here. its such a cute place. very inviting. the food was yummy. i enjoyed every bite of the forgot the name?roll and an appetizer called tempura stuffed jalapenoi think thats the name. service was friendly and attentive. ill be back!
fresh fishes,order are big,worth it for the price.great service.try the 40 12 course meals menu very good,so much foods so good!willing to recommend!definitely be back again!
good japanese food! i got the sashimi dinner and my girlfriend got the touch and go. we also shared the crispy rice which was delicious. good amount of food for the price! great service from takashi and kawika. will definitely go back soon!
the best sushi in vegas!!! great prices.  the owner visited with us while making us sushi the whole time.  amazing food and conversation.  he really puts pride in his business and you can tell the quality of the sushi compared to other restaurants around town.  we usually go to a sushi place on craig and tenaya closer to our house but there is no comparison.
my boyfriend and i just went here last night. it was so good that it prompted me to write my first review on yelp! i do a lot of review reading before i go, so i had a good heads up. my boyfriend and i shared the meal where you get 3 of any of their specialty rolls each usually cost 1215 and it also came with edamame, unlimited salad and miso soup, and ice cream to share. i cannot say enough about the salad! it salad always came dressed that way, i probably wouldnt eat anything else ever again! the sauce we light and sweet, and the salad came with a large slice of avocado and a slice of tomato. my mouth is watering thinking about it still! the miso soup was delicious. the vanilla ice cream was great. the edamame was salted just the way i like it. okay, onto the rolls... we ordered the red dragon, forgot name, and the king club. all three of them we as perfect as can be and sooo freaking good. also, the ambiance in this place is on point! its fresh and modern, great music. but one of my favorite parts is the little hut each table is under. great, great sushi place. most definitely our new spot.
ate last night. food was good. tonkatsu sushi was very good, interesting with cream cheese. steak bites good, everything was good and affordable, there were 7 of us and the bill was 118 even with a few drinks. i would come again.
when for the grand opening yesterday and it was fantastic. but i was very impressed that they had hot donuts waiting for me and i was in and out in 5 minutes terrific especially because i had my 3  6 year old with me. finally finished off the last donut and it was still delicious as ever cant wait to go back next week and try some more varieties chocolate and lemon and raspberry are on my list. check out was very quick and this seems knowledgeable, up beat, great attitudes, and the energy in the place was poppin!   my daughter thinks the donuts are pretty and she had 4 that day!! it was her first krispy kreme experience i mean i couldnt stop her lol  welcome to avondale and im excited to visit again real soon like in a few days lol its going to be my daughter and i little date spot lol and i cant wait to get some coupons for drinks and try some new stuff ; ;
went in on the grand opening day and it was very busy, but the atmosphere inside did not make me feel as if i was waiting very long. the place looked somewhat overstaffed, yet all the employees were working together really well. my donuts were perfect, and i cant wait to go back for more!
this location rocks! it is clean, well ran and they provide great customer service, the staff is ready to serve you hot fresh doughnuts with a smile and that is what made my experience worthy of a compliment. i highly recommend this location if you are  in west phoenix.
donut nirvana. ohmmmmm...krispy kreme glazed doughnuts hot off the line are like kissing dewy sunlight and double rainbows. great to see a kk come to town and its super convenient off the i10 and dysart. aside from the long line of cars and people stringing out the front door to the back parking lot on national doughnut day in the rain!, the wait is reasonable and the staff is super nice. and cant beat the price. :oonce avondale adds the planned noodles and company, ill only need to leave the west valley when im in the mood for good chinese food!
it hasnt even been open a week and weve gone twice. ha! we wanted to see if they had their machine back up and running. they did... hundreds of glazed donuts going on down the line. though it makes me sad to see the lessthanperfect donuts end up in the trash. : they had the southern classics this time, peach pie and lemon kreme cake. we got one of each to take home. warmed them up in the microwave and devoured them. they were delicious! krispy kreme makes me happy. :
everything they make is so delicious. dont be surprised to see most everything sold out at times due to the high traffic volume. its that good. they also offer discounts. i received 10 off for prior military. i am so happy to have them in my neighborhood.
i was there yesterday  62115 at around 5 and the donut processing machine was down i guess? regardless of this being down and how unfortunate that is i had a great experience it was my first time in this location i spoke with who i believe was the gm nate who helped me and gave me exceptional customer service in my time there, i will definitely come back and would like to see how the machine works, the staff at this location seem to be great and i will recommend them to friends and family.
this location is great for the obvious reasons like the doughnuts and coffee are delicious. they do have something else going on there..everyone is extremely nice and smiling real smiles. its ambiguously fun in there because the good times are genuine which transfers to anyone who walks in. ever go to a starbucks and it can feel like there is an undercurrent of hostility? this place is the opposite of that. it feels like youre walking in to a jimmy buffet song dude. good times
this new location is great. its convenient and right off the freeway. their donuts and service are great as always as well. fast and friendly.
fantastic customer service at this location, they didnt have exactly what i needed for a big meeting and the manager went out of his way to get my brew boxes from another store. i would highly recommend the store for the most delicious donuts and the best customer service around.
discovery academy stimulate every child into discovering the world around them. promote and understanding of language, culture, and citizenship.  children increase skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic, learning through the exchange ideas in a balance of individuality and citizenship. definitely the best place for any children!
great staff  and beautiful atmosphere for your child you get  early  into childhood learning adventure
discovery academy offers an excellent curriculium. my daughter has advanced 2 grade levels with her reading.
absolutely love the school and all the teachers.  our daughter goes twice a week, half day, with ms malinda. i feel so comfortable leaving my daughter here i know she will be safe, have fun, and learn. were looking for a school not a daycare, we toured so many places and none if them felt right. when we toured i was blown away by ms heather and the detail of everything she went over. our daughter started in august, she has learned so much in the short time, i cant wait to see what the rest of the school year has in store. we definitely recommend discovery academy! go visit!
this school is awesome, the teachers are awesome! what they do in regards to education is nothing short of amazing. my 3 year old knows all planets and their order in detail, she knows days of the week and months of the year and is beginning to read, the list just goes on. they love the kids and education and that makes them unstoppable! highly recommended!
is my first time to go to the massage  in this spa . i like the they serve ，is very nice .
it is really nice place and the service is great!  the price is reasonable! i definitely will come back again and bring my friends also.
we came in for a 30 minute reflexology foot massage and ion detox and i was super happy about the service and the staff.its extremely peaceful, relaxing and clean here. the colors and music immediately put you in a frame of mind to let go of stress.the foot massage was awesome. honestly, ive never had a dedicated foot massage but this one wont be my last.the ion detox is cool but more than anything else it feels great to sit quietly and pamper myself.5 star establishment and experience.
this was my first time to rainbow foot spa. it is very close to my home so i decided to give it a try. this place is very clean and the atmosphere was very nice. service was amazing. joe was my therapist and he was very strong yet not painful. i had some serious knots and he was able to work them all out. i will definitely be back soon.
you will see me and my husband here every weekend.  very clean and super relaxing.  price is very reasonable.  the staff are very friendly, accommodating and most of all very professional.  i highly recommend this place if you want to relax and be pampered.
boyfriend and i stopped in for some much needed quick relaxation. we both enjoyed a 30 min foot massage and it was amazing! the best relaxing, quick, pickmeup massage for a very reasonable price. im happy to say well be going back again here real soon!
we are visiting vegas and i wanted to find a reasonably priced foot massage so i was happy to find this place. its located in a strip mall, so super easy parking. the massage area is open but very dark and partitioned off front the front door and windows. comfortable lounge chairs to stretch out. low light and natures music playing softly add to the comfortable atmosphere. i was the only person there that i saw other than the male masseuse.  even though i was fully clothed he layed a large towel over my body, which made me feel more secure and more able to fully relax. he worked on my feet using reflexology and what a pleasure. strong hands worked out all the tight spots.  if i lived here i would be back weekly.
best foot spa ive ever been. people that worked there are very accomodating and friendly. the place is very clean and the massage is so great that i always feel so relax after. my wife and i are aleady regular customers here every weekend. ask for jenny if you really want to have a great massage experience. i highly recommend this place to tourist and local people.
i absolutely love this facility and the amazing staff that work here ! this is my second laser hair removal facility ive been to and i would never go anywhere else. when i first decided to try out laser hair removal i went to a medspa and did 8 treatments for my arms, legs and underarms. i didnt not see any results and wasted a lot of . i didnt want to give up on laser hair removal because i figured everyone uses different machines, so i found simplicty laser on groupon and i came in and ended up signing up for a membership because of how clean and effective my first treatment was !!! i couldnt believe it. best investment ive made for my self :
great place to get your laser hair reduction done. the staff is great and knowledgable. i am getting great results. the monthly membership is totally worth it, especially if you are paying month after month for waxing. it will save you money in the long run and you wont have to get painful waxing done ever again.
yesterday i bought 6 variety of cupcakes for my daughters bd.  every flavor was very moist and fresh.  the quality from the new owner has improved in the short time they have owned.  i highly recommend.  the carmel salted cupcake was tasty, yum yum, along with the other flavors we picked.
a hidden gem! two large pastry cases filled with doughnuts, cupcakes, muffins, and other pastries. there is also a coffee bar. everything was fresh and staff was very friendly.
we love this place great coffee and doughnuts and very friendly owner we need to support local owned businesses such as this....
wow, what a nice little donut shop right in harrisburg!this place has it all, everyday!  donuts, cupcakes, cake....gluten free options too!!  also a full coffee shop and has some sandwiches too!come here for donuts, not their breakfast sandwiches.  the sandwich was good but tiny for the price.  the donuts are awesome!  they have every kind of donut you would want and you wont be disappointed!  the owners are also super nice
the staff was awesome and very out going. all the families that were there were sooo sweet. they have a huge selection on everything but come early cause there delicious bagels get gone very quickly. all the donuts look soooo yummy i feel like a 5year old trying to decide which one to get. i would have taken some pictures of the selection but i was sooo excited to get out of the car i left it in my car. i will be going back even though im in east charlotte and have no business being on that side of town that now have serious business of a reason.this surely a must place to go!
very clean shop with helpful and friendly staff and  i love their variety of sweets such as donuts, muffins, pies and pastries . there carmel frappuccino was especially good too!!
its so wonderful to have a local bakery in harrisburg. its very clean and the staff is so friendly and helpful.  donuts are delicious and fresh. they have a variety of other baked goods...but the whoopie pies!!!  the whoopie pies are absolutely phenomenal!!!! they are huge and fresh and perfectly made. i bought 5 to take to a gettogether.  i quartered them and they displayed nicely in a platter.  kids and adults raved at how delicious they were.  get over there and buy some whoopie pies!
i have been here a couple times and love it. my wife found the place when in the area as we do not live close by. but the 20 minute drive is worth it if you have to have donuts or bagels. i wish there was one on the concord huntsville town line around poplar tent rd.
the best dirty chai! lattes are always way too hot but that is the only complaint i have. everything ive tried is good. bacon maple donuts and the breakfast sandwiches are delish.
great variety of baked goods.  best breakfast sandwiches in the area.  much better bang for your buck than starbucks or dunkin donuts
today we were lucky enough to be one of the first guests to try out this little gem! i have to say i am a breakfast snob, and am tough to impress, however, they succeeded with flying colors. the service was impeccable even considering it was a soft open training day. the chickichanga breakfast burrito was amazing. the coffee was fragrant and bold. i applaud these guys on a great start. will definitely be back!
we were fans of first watch when we lived in kansas city so we were very excited to learn one was opening up near our home. we tried it out today and it did not disappoint. the service was great, everyone was very friendly, and the restaurant itself is very cute. the food way very tasty and satisfying. we had the breakfast tacos and the avocado toast and they were both very flavorful. we were also able to try the new fresh juices they offer and they were delicious! ice cold and fresh  perfect compliment to our meals. we look forward to eating here again!
flew in to visit the inlaws and dropped in for lunch. the food was outstanding and i am a major foodie. the kale tonic is absolutely fantastic and the skillet hash is to die for. the service was fabulous and the gm mike came out to check on us and make sure everything was great. ive been saying for awhile that phoenix is really starting to grow as a foodie mecca and this only helps solidify its position. best breakfastlunch spot in phoenix!!!!
i stopped in thinking this was a little starbucks like cafe but was very pleasantly surprised to see that they were so much more. they are a full restaurant with such friendly staff and an amazing array of fresh food to offer. i only had time to grab an iced coffee this morning but after chatting with the wonderful ladies up front, i will definitely be back again to try their delicious food as well.
amazing food  service! great new location. the decor is a huge upgrade from the other locations. love the avacado toast...this is my new sunday staple.
love this place! we went twice this past weekend. the menu is excellent, the staff is super friendly, and the decor is inviting. so glad this is close to home!!
delicious meal, great service!! i cant wait to come back. second trip to this location and cant wait to come back!highly recommend the lemon ricotta pancakes and the blte.thanks!
wow wow wow! first watch on steroids! always been a fan, but this is really upscale breakfast! the avocado toast is must! great location, as this area has been starving for a good breakfast place for awhile. get there soon, because when the word gets out it will be packed!
needed a good american breakfast near the biltmore hotel.  good selection and you can get lunch as well.  reasonable prices  much much better than the biltmore  and friendly service. was happy with my pot of coffee and my traditional breakfast plate.
great breakfast we had the avocado toast that was fantastic and the chickichanga was delicious. friendly waitress who could actually make a recommendation when asked with timely service. we will be back to keep trying out this incredible menu!
i enjoyed breakfast with my husband this morning and will definitely be back! we loved the location and the early opening 6:30am on a sunday. the cozy patio was perfect for outside dining especially since the dining room was a bit too cold first thing in the morning. i had the yogurt, fruit and granola bowl and it was great. the granola was made inhouse and was delicious, however the muffin served room temp was forgettable. my husband had the frittata had he enjoyed it but did say it was a bit overcooked. the portions are generous and the service is outstanding. our server was lauren b and she was perfect! my husband already passed on the good review to his dad.
i came in around 1 on a sunday by myself. i was seated immediately. every staff member i spoke to was so genuinely nice and attentive. i ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were really, really good. ill definitely be back.
probably the best breakfast place i have ever been to!  so many healthy and delicious options!!  clean, adorable place! i will be back for sure.
ordered the breakfast tacos without cheese and its delicious! i didnt want the beans that came with it as a side, the server offered fruits or potatoes instead. that was nice! some servers wont do that. the atmosphere is very relaxing, the place looks polished and everyone was very friendly. it was a great time overall!
was so happy when first watch opened on the east side. their breakfasts are amazing and so is their service. this time i had the power wrap and wow was it delicious. i highly recommend first watch. never had a bad meal or bad service
this place is awesome, arcadia atmosphere without the arcadia wait.  at least for now.  im sure as good as this place is, it wont be long before its 12 hours to get in for breakfast.  highly recommend the chickichanga, absolutely delicious.  their kale drink is really good too. its a hidden away quiet place thats great for kids too.  highly recommend.
had breakfast here. the decor and atmosphere are very nice. pancakes were very good and the chickichanga was spicy and also very good.  we had a small issue with our order and but as the manager came over, unsolicited, just to check on us and once he was told he quickly and professionally took care of the issue. i wish more managers showed they cared about customers as much as this one. will definately return for the good atmosphere, food, and courteous management.
food was amazing! eggs benedict was on point! tasted very fresh! staff was very nice and welcoming! this place is a must for breakfastbrunch!
price is very reasonable and the selection is very good. the seating is very comfortable.enjoy first watch every time i have been there. my new spot. seems like everything is 10 and under. always looking to my next visit.
my boyfriend and i go to this first watch every saturday and have yet to have a bad experience. we have had nothing but great service since coming here the past 3 months and the good is just delicious.i want to give a shout out to kim and jon who go out of their way to say hello to us and make us feel welcome each time we come in. like i said, the food is great! while we have tried almost everything on the menu, my boyfriend loves the breakfast tacos and no matter what i always come back to the lemon ricotta pancakes. i have recommended first watch to people looking for a great new breakfast cafe and will continue to do so!
fantastic service and great food price is ok but i love the juice!!! got to try all 3!!!!
i cant believe im going to review a first watch, but we have had such amazing experiences at this one that i have to. ive eaten here a few times and both times theyve been so nice to us and amazing with our kids. each time theyve been quick about getting some food or drink for the kids and theyve even played and talked to them. the decor inside the restaurant is modern and new and the food has been great. most other first watchs ive been to have dirty and old, not this one. i highly recommend, these people really enjoy their jobs and you can tell.
this location has a totally different and updated menu its really great food fresh and local this is not the old one notch above dennys first watch our server erin was so charming and delightful ! and funny coffee was excellent i had the ham and gruyere cheese omelet made with egg white yummy !
delicious, fast, and inexpensive! not very often do you find those three words in the same sentence. love this place for lunch. they have great lunch specials and the staff is super friendly and fast. they have a great half and half special for 8 and everything is wonderful. their butternut squash soup is awesome. i will definitely come back again.
i am on a quest to find the best pancakes in the valley. so far firstwatch wears the crown. if youre a flapjack connoisseur you must try their banana granola pancakes. it can be busy on the weekends, so try to beat the rush. however, a small communal seating area shortens the wait if youre with a small party.
great food! always delicious and filling. love coming here!
this place is amazing!its brand new and clean, fantastic service, and most importantly... delicious!i cant wait to go back and try everything else they have to offer. so far, i cant get enough of the brownies and the cupcakes. if anything else is half as good as those, youre in for a treat!
i believe the location has changed to the university area. this place is great, cute and in a nice location at the broadwalk. we tried several desserts and all were aw
we have been there multiple times. the store is small but cute and not stuffy. the cupcakes are simply amazing. the most craft of any dessert ive ever tried. there is a rotation of flavors. the owner is super nice and will give you advice if you just cant decide. i feel like im going to see her winning on a food network show someday. im a food snob and this place does not disappoint.
this place is fantastic. a coworker told me about it and had to drive and make an order. i purchased strawberry and lemon cupcakes. each of them were amazing. best bakery in charlotte now! i will definitely tell everyone about this place.
absolutely awesome! the cupcakes were feat. i will definitely be back. make sure you try the strawberry and lemon cupcakes. the staff is friendly and the establishment is very clean.
danyelle is a great therapist, she has great energy and does a very relaxing massage.  you can tell she really enjoys what she does, and i plan on seeing her regularly!
went to see danyelle twice now and both experiences are amazing!  professional, friendly, and great looking gal! highly recommend!
beautiful tap room! fantastic beer. staff is all knowledgeable and very friendly. really cool growlers and glass wear.
ive been following wooden robot brewery since i first thought about moving to charlotte, and was super excited to hear about their soft opening. im so glad i wasnt disappointed! firstly, wooden robot is one of the coolest names ever, so they already get an a for that. but the real awesome thing is they take the theme throughout the whole brewery: an eclectic mix of wood and steel throughout the tap room gives it a fun yet industrial feel. and the idea of putting giant comfy couches in an area with beer is great! i felt like i was in an episode of friends but i was holding beer instead of coffee, which is way more awesome. now, to the important part: the beer! it was great!!!! the pale ale had a very light yet flavorful body. the saison was beautifully crafted and not too bitter. and both of their ipas were unique. personally, i thought the ipas were amazing, however; if you are into west coast ipas you might be disappointed. they were not as hoppy as many west coast style beers. for a notsograndunofficalopening, i really think they nailed it! cant wait to see how this brewery grows!
very impressed with what she is having.
this place is hands down one of the best breweries! fresh  super tasty beers, awesome staff that is knowledgable, and great ambiance. definitely worth checking out!
awesome! great beer and amazing space! very knowledgable and attentive staff, a must visit among the diverse charlotte brewery scene.
new player on the scene with surprisingly complex beers! incredible new entry into the clt beer scene!
great rotation of beers. awesome open layout it never feels overly crowded. the bar staff is always friendly and attentive.
great beer, great bartenders, beautiful space! i really love the oatmeal stout, good morning vietnam and razz hands!
wow, so impressive. the facility, tasting room and prep area is so cool. we got to meet dan the brewmaster. he is very knowledgeable. glad we found this gem. want to take a keg home.
this place deserves five stars alone for handling the large group that the fincon conference brought in. we walked in with at least 6080 people possibly more, im not sure at one time and they got everyone their beers in a very efficient manner.awesome layout, fantastic outside patio area, and great ambiance. i got the what shes having double ipa and it was definitely one of the best ipas ive ever had. hoppy but smooth, if that makes sense. enjoying it on their patio was one of the most pleasant parts of my trip to charlotte.
i love wooden robot.  the beers here are wonderful and forever changing which is a good things.  their ipas and pale ales stay a constant and i love their growlers.  good luck to you wooden robot!
i dont care what people in charlotte think, they have horrible taste and promote trash beer. this is literally the most creative, experimental, and delicious brewery in the entire metro area. ive lived in san diego, denver, and now clt. this is the only brewery ill consistently go to. seriously, if youre looking for a brewery that serves wine, stop, and go home. this place is pushing the limits of taste and will only continue to skyrocket. thanks all you robots!
glassy wood theme brewery with unique flavors.i came to the brewery several times, and each time i am impressed by the distinct flavors that they created.   all there beers are unique and well formed.  definitely get a flight and sample the assortment they offer.  more often than not youll find something there the jives well with what your mouth likes.the building is clean and well styled in a nice minimal wooden brick motif.  haha ya its nice. go enjoy the outside patio too if the weather is good. its worth checking out.  classy casual.
excellent. wide variety of beer styles and a terrific foodtruck relationship with twisted eats. id suggest the return of hop rocks sour ipa and the what hes having ipa.
great selection of beer. wow!  what an incredible menu!  the unique flavors of good morning vietnam.... whoa! and its everything that they described it to be!  i got a growler for my bf of the witbier and he loved it!  if you love all beers come here. they dont discriminate. haha!  stouts  ipas  sours!!!  for all! and more of course. im excited about this brewery!
hands down my favorite brewery in charlotte. the selection and quality of beers brewed surpasses any other brewery in town!
absolutely love this place. brandon and evelyn are amazing. they motivate you and keep you going. and the atmosphere is great.
sweat zone is a family place where every member gets what they need from fitness goals to nutrition advice to health coaching in general.
i love this place! not only does the trainer, brandon know the ins and outs of fitness but he is an amazing instructor. i have been going to the sweat zone for a little over a month and have noticed a huge improvement not only physically but in my endurance and strength as well. another thing i love about this place is that brandon alters each exercise to fit into exactly what you need to accomplish your goals, whatever they may be.
sweat zone is the place to be! if you want to challenge yourself and put yourself to the next level in fitness. give brandon a chance to make you sweat!a comfortable family owned gym with all functional tools to give your body something new to challenge yourself to its fullest. one hour of sweat either personal one on one, but i recommend the group classes to get you moving! brandon is one of the most knowledgeable and greatest trainers i have worked with. thanks for the change!
absolutely love working out at sweatzone! classes are fun, exciting and still manage to get a phenomenal sweat in one hours time!!! i used to go to lvac daily, not anymore that place is a social gallery and no one is there to train. brandon  eveylan are awesome trainers, they take the time to understand what your goals and expectations are to accomplish.
absolutely amazing gym and trainers! i train with brandon and i saw results in as little as two weeks! he makes training so much fun and you can definitely feel yourself getting stronger. not only that but he knows so much about what hes doing, he can answer any questions you have about the workouts youre doing. i would definitely recommend this gym!
coach brandon and the crew are fantastic! the training is top notch with a huge variety of workouts. great pricing and even better customer service. highly recommend sweatzone!
live in an area with lots of scorpions and roaches, so i decided to call complete pest management. glad that i did, service is top notch and professional, this company has not missed one step at all. when the service tech showed up, and introduced himself, he asked immediately what and where are our pest issues. he spent an hour treating the house, and explained everything i needed to know about our scorpion problem. after meeting art our technician, i knew this was the service for us. we would see on average 5 to 10 scorpions a month inside our house, now we have not seen any after three months of service. on the third month we had fire ants in our grass, showed art on his monthly visit, they were gone the next day, and have not been back since. this is the company to go with, my wife and i are in the process of building a pool soon, we will hire them for our pool service as well, for when that time comes. first class company all the way.
i am in real estate and we refer complete pest management all the time! they are professional, honest, reasonable, and effective. i personally had a scorpion infestation and they came out quickly and treated the problem, all while educating me on what i can do to help the issue. they also have a wonderful sister company, complete pool care. also a great service! id recommend these guys to anyone looking for a reasonable cost with superb service. these guys are on top of their stuff!!
mike rbest pest control service we have ever had. art is extremely knowledgeable and has many years of experience in the field. hes like a professor! he took considerable time explaining  details of various treatments  and answered many questions  about the different pests involved  and the way to eliminate them. we just began the service but have a great deal of confidence that this company will eradicate the indoor scorpions and the outdoor mice.
the best food ever ! the grilled octopus is so tender and has a secret ingredient in it ! the chicken is so flavourful and fresh ! a must try
this place is great! i followed jen the owner from her old salon. their prices are fair and she is great. i even come in to get a weekly wash and blowout on top of my regular services. you wont be disappointed, she is fantastic! i refer her to everyone in my area that asks.
jen the owner is great we have been following her for years even before she owned her own salon.  she does a great job and she is a master colorer.although if you tell her to scalp your husband without his knowledge she will.  thanks jen for all the great years of service.  your awesome
ive been going to jennifer for a few years now and i couldnt ask for a better stylist! when i first went in my hair colored was a mess  blond was almost green!  she fixed the color and gave me an awesome style   great salon and stylist for all your needs.
im new to the area and bought a groupon to try the salon out. my appointment was with celeste. she is personable, and did a great job. i gave her a general idea of what i wanted, and she was able to see it through to give me a great color and cut. i love my new hair and will be back! im glad groupon brought me in.
great food!
very tasty and authentic chinese food!! absolutely no taste of msg. the environment is very clean and comfy. service is top  the chef is really friendly and accommodating. highly recommend!
truly authentic chinese food.  highly recommend cauliflower dish, eggplant dish, peking pork, dumplings, braised pork with egg, green beans... perhaps not authentic but the blueberry yam dish was interesting and quite tasty. all of the above were per owners recommendation, and they were all excellent! also had the spicy chicken dish which was numbingly spicy if youre into that stuff. definitely a place i would recommend to others!
this guy killed...sadly, we never got around to see him when he had his stint at flamingo but fortunately he hasnt left vegas and found a new place to perform at tommy wind. i went tonight with my girlfriend who generally doesnt like comedians but this is one guy she said she could see again and again...i cant remember seeing an act that had us both laughing as hard or as often. hes quick, sharp and works race and sexual humor into his routine as he picks apart the audience and is truly the best ive seen at doing this kind of stand up. vinnie favorito totally lived up to the hype.
i always saw billboards of this guy all over town when he was performing at the flamingo for the longest time. he disappeared for a bit but now has a stand up act at the the tommy wind theater fomerly known as the boulevard theater.so when i found out he was back, i immediately got tickets to his opening night show on thursday 6415. im glad i did because this guys act is all improv basically. his show is based on what kind of crowd is in attendance. as a fair warning, if you have never seen his show, you better not be the type to easily get offended and are politically correct. doesnt matter where you sit in the audience, nobody is safe from his comical banter. he doesnt really stick to a routine. his quick wit and smart ass replies to the audience is what makes him genuinely laugh out loud funny. like i said, nobody is safe from his wise cracks and that includes the servers, bar tenders, security, lighting, sound, etc. if you are in the room, you are fair game. i like this guy because his shtick covers everything from religion, race, stereo types and yes if you have any kind of accent whether light or heavy, he will go after you.some random info. it is 5 bucks to park in the tw parking lot because its valet only. if you dont want to pay then you can park at monte carlo casino and then cross the street. the theater is down an alley way in between fatburger and walgreens. the actual theater itself is located next to a 24 hour all you can eat korean restaurant. im surprised the theater doesnt smell like kalbi ribs or beef bulgogi. while you are waiting in the lobby for the show to start, there is a bar conveniently located there so you can get you alcoholic refreshment groove on. as soon as you are seated in the main theater, not only is there another bar, but a very sexy server will be walking around getting you more drinks.in closing, dude is genuinely funny. the show i saw lasted about an hour. i will definitely be bringing all my friends and family that are 18 or older to come see vinnie.yelp 2015 review 29527 overall
kevin, anthony and joe made my move so much easier than others ive made in the past. they were good with wrapping my furniture really well so nothing showed at at the new place damaged. friendly, good looking crew!
at first, i was hesitant about having anybody move my furniture after a bad experience with a different moving company about 6 years ago where they did alot of damage to my furniture. i decided to give this moving company a chance. joe, kevin, and anthony restored my confidence. they did an excellent job! i brought a new armoire for my bedroom in my new home and it was tough to get it up my staircase because there is a twist halfway up the stairs. getting it through my bedroom was another challengeit was too wide to get it through the doorway of my bedroom but they carefully took off the doors and managed to get it through. they had to do the same thing to my refrigerator in my kitchen too but there was no damage. i would highly recommend this company and these guys!
i would give them 10 stars if i could!  we recently relocated our daughter and these guys were recommended by a friend of ours in phoenix.  the stress of moving our daughter from california to phoenix was overwhelming and from the moment these guys showed up, we were at ease.  with muscles in their arms and smiles on their faces, they quickly scopedout the furniture and boxes. then with almost choreographylike precision, they packed up their truck.  not only were they careful with each piece of furniture, heres the amazing part... they literally run not walk back into the house to get the next load!  an awesome sight when you are paying by the hour.  all 3 guys have been in the moving business for years, and their competency shows.  when we arrived at my daughters new residence in phoenix, as you might imagine, there was quite a bit of shifting furniture as it was placed.  she had them put the couch in one place, then another, then back to the first place.  same with the heavy tv.  these guys had such a positive agreeable attitude... never lost their patience.  they were a total pleasure  we hated to see them leave.  we are pleased beyond words and so happy to post this review.  we highly recommend them.  from start to finish, you will not be disappointed.
this moving company did amazing work! they where fast and careful with all of the things i needed moving! if i could i would give this company 10 stars !
kevin and the team at poindexter are amazing.  i am a top real estate agent in the phoenix metro area and we refer their team to nearly all of our buyerssellers.  you can tell from the moment that they step through the door that these guys actually care. if you have used movers before, you can probably relate that most are not pleasant or careful with your belongings.  not poindexter!  they take the utmost care, are nice guys, and provide a great service from start to finish. highly recommend them!
hard work ethic. great attitudes and high morals. was very hot this day and these guys were going above and beyond what they were asked to do. i will definatly reuse them and refer them. very professional. very hard working.
i recently moving into my new flat but i couldnt find enough people to help me move. i decided to break down and hire some movers. they were prompt and handled everything with care. anthony was very personable and friendly. i would recommend them to anyone who is in a crunch for time and needs nice and inexpensive movers.
very happy with these guys.  we had them move a fridge from one place to our house.  they wrapped it up and moved it to our place with no problems. we appreciated that  they were careful and quick.  charged us flat rate of 100. happy with their service.
i manage a storage facility in scottsdale and i cant even begin to tell you how awesome these guys are!! they really take great care when moving your items and take tremendous pride in making sure their customers are happy!!! i know my customers love them!! great job guys!!!
i had huge pieces of furniture that needed to be moved. guys were prompt and professionally dressed. great attitudes and excellent service. i am a real estate agent and will refer them to all my clients!!
simply awesome!! best experience ive ever had with moving.  3 guys, a truck, muscle and hustle! i was blown away by how quickly and efficiently they loaded up my house and moved it into the new place. all i really had to do was stand there and tell them where to put things! they were prompt, professional, courteous and had great attitudes... truly, a joy to work with.  if i have to move again, i will definitely be calling these guys and no one else.
joe and kevin were awesome! this is the first time i have used professional movers and i had a few worries about how my things would be handled. those worries were quickly gone. joe and kevin were very personable and fast. i even made a quick run to get some more moving blankets with no concerns leaving them alone with my apartment. joe was great with keeping in contact before the move, calling with a reminder a few days before and the day of the move. hopefully i wont have to move again anytime soon, but if i do hire other movers down the road i feel like i will be disappointed because poindexter has set the bar so high.
when my boyfriend and i decided to move out of the house with 3 other roommates we checked around for some quotes. most places would explain their charges but when i got the quote emailed to me i would notice fine print. when i talked to the guys at poindexter they explained how they charge and when the paperwork was emailed to me i saw no hidden fees, so i choose them as the winners as my boyfriend grumbled about how we could do it ourselves for cheaper. when the guys showed up they worked quickly and efficiently to get everything wrapped up and into the truck, and had no problem with the craziness of moving half the furniture since our roommates were staying, but we were going, and they paid close attention to what was going and staying. the guys even had no problem with my crazy lab barking at them through the entire process and even stopped to pet her a few times to help calm her down. when it came time to leave the house one of them even helped load her crate into my car!when they started unloading things into the apartment we didnt know where to put everything and they did a wonderful job keeping up and even helping out when i decided a few things needed moved somewhere else and rather than just letting me do it, they offered to move it around for me!the guys were awesome!! they were professionals at exactly the right time, but also had a great sense of humor and we even swapped a few sarcastic comments back and forth! after the guys left and i had paid, including a tip, i went back in and bet my boyfriend dinner that he couldnt guess how much we paid. he way over guessed, and even told me he was happy with how great the guy did! save your self some time, hassle, and get a few good laughs out of the deal  these guys are way worth the money!!
these guys are great! professional, courteous, and trustworthy. i used them for an office move and was very impressed, so much so we are contemplating using them for all future employeeoffice relocations. in addition, i will use them personally and will and would recommend them to anyone that is looking for movers.
amazing group of guys! had to cancel last minute because of a pipe break in the new house and they rescheduled me with no problem. wrapped everything, cleaned up after themselves,  and put everything back together in the new house. could not have asked for anything more. great job kevin, matt and joe, you have forever won my business and referrals.
great group of guys! we were very impressed by their professionalism and enthusiasm.  quick, friendly and skilled!
joeanthony kevinty are fantastic they were punctual extremely careful with our stuff.   work fast and are very efficient. i would use them again without hesitation the best they were by far the least stressful part of our move.dr. timothy and jenny woehl
these guys were awesome. not only were they super nice, but they did a great job getting my items from point a to point b in a short amount of time while keeping their standards high. i would definitely recommend poindexter to anyone who is looking for a trust worthy moving company!
these guys are amazing! they literally run in between each unloading. so friendly, so kind,  and reliable. i recommend them to anyone moving , packing, or just need a little extra muscle. thanks anthony, joe, and kevin im a poindexter fan for sure.
these guys are amazing!  they are professional, funny, and fast!  i have seen their work many times and have yet to see them in slow motion.  normally they run to and from the truck.  they usually have multiple guys working at the same time too making the job go faster while not wasting time.  i will continue to recommend poindexter to customers, family, and friends.  keep up the great work guys!
these guys were the best movers ive ever worked with. prompt and professional. unlike a lot of moving companies that provide middleage, usually over weight men, poindexter provided collegeage, very fit guys that could easily tackle the 2story move. i will definitely use them for my next move. awesome job!
these guys are awesome!!! we were moving to idaho and needed some help loading the trucks. we have moved several times on our own and it is stressful and a lot of work! we called for a quote and i was pleased with their prices. they were friendly, funny, quick to respond and got us all loaded up fantastically. they even made the kids feel great about loading up all their toys. all our items made it safe and sound! great group of guys! definitely cant say enough about these dudes ... just hire them and the stress of moving is gone!!! thanks for such an awesome experience!!!
i never write reviews but i just couldnt help myself on this one! these guys were amazing! after an awful roommate situation and having to break my lease, my heart dropped thinking of moving in the middle of august. i purchased a groupon for 3 guys for a great deal but they surprised me and showed up with 5 guys at no additional cost! my whole house was loaded, driven to a storage unit, and unloaded in an hour and 5 minutes! they completely took care of all my items including wrapping my mattress and glass tables so they wouldnt be damaged. i was worried the 2 hours for the groupon wouldnt be enough, but these guys literally run back and forth and pour sweat all while keeping smiles on their faces. i didnt see them take a breather once! they may be young college kids but they were more professional and provided better customer service than i have ever received from any company. there is an additional 95 charge that wasnt mentioned in the fine print, but they are well worth it! not only were they upbeat and happy, they were non stop making me laugh with their interactions between me and their fellow coworkers. you can tell they enjoy their jobs and the people they work with. i would of been crying after loading the first 2 boxes of heat exhaustion but i didnt have to lift a finger except to point which items were mine to move. they turned my nightmare living situation into peace of mind! when it comes time to unload my storage unit into my new place in a few months, i definitely want to use them again!
this company is amazing! they set the standard for moving.  not only did they come to the house to give us a quote, they set a max quote for about 8.5 hours, and they went a bit over on the time, and they kept to their max quote.  nothing broken.  they moved an 800 pound gun safe, no problem, no extra charge.  i thought there would be some fine print, and they would be able to charge more, but nope!  they are all clean cut, and they are all very respectful, and full of courteous remarks, and great attitude.  i do residential mortgage, and if any of my customers are looking for movers, i will only give one referral, poindexter moving!
these boys by far the best moving company i have ever dealt with they know exactly what customer service is all about and they are professional i  would recommend them to anyone including my own family.
this company is great!! these guys work fast and really know what they are doing. i had them moving a second floor apartment to another second floor apartment a couple miles away and they laughed and smiled the whole time even though it was hot and humid. i had three glass cabinets and a number of ikea pieces that tend to not be too sturdy but everything made it perfectly. the guys had to take apart some exercise equipment and put it back together and they did that very quickly as well so it didnt add on too much time. i can not recommend this company enough, they are a great group of guys who are professional, knowledgeable and cool.
i run a storage facility in mesa. im very impressed when you guys come on property as they are always professional looking and they clean up after their work. while ive never personally use them, because of how they carry themselves, if i needed to use movers i would definitely give them a call.
i have been meaning to leave this review for over a week because i promised anthony, joe, and travis i was serious and wasnt just blowing up their ego about how amazing they are.  i purchased a groupon for 3 guys and two hours; the three guys killed it and got my move done in the time frame and they even had to drive 30 minutes to my new apartment.  i went from a second floor apartment to a third floor and was about as impressed as i could have been.  i watched these three guys carefully carry my belongings out to their truck and then sprint back to my place to get another box.  i was exhausting watching them and couldnt have asked for a better moving experience.  i will be booking this company the next time i move.  anthony, joe, and travis you three are amazing and i couldnt thank you enough for how great you were.  sorry this is late, but better late than never!  plus, i actually left it... told ya i would :
i found poindexter through a groupon offering a great rate on 3 movers and a truck for 2 hours. they may have had extra handsondeck that particular day, but it wound up turning into an underpromise and overdeliver situation, when i had 4 movers assist me into my new home a few hours earlier than anticipated. they were all funny, friendly and fast; they even helped assemble a couple items. great service  highly recommend!
poindexter moving made my moving experience as stress free as possible.  i called them about a week in advance of my move, and they were able to fit me in their schedule.  they work 7 days a week, so they are able to make things work on the customers timeframe.   scheduling was a breeze and they gave a window of time.  they called about 30 minutes before they showed up.  joe, joey and ty were all very professional.  the price was very reasonable, and what i found impressive was that they didnt mess around.  as soon as they showed up they got right to work loading the truck and worked very quickly to get everything done quick. they also took great care to wrap everything in moving blankets to protect everything.  quick, careful and professional!  i would use this company again.
excellent moving company. i found them through groupon but will refer them to all. i have moved several times in the last several years. no company stands up to this one. they did exactly what they promised. a two hour move with no hidden costs. these guys were hard workers and very good at what they do. the crew, kevin, joe, anthony and joey, all introduced themselves and shook my hand. so personable and professional. i always look for good customer service and want to recommend this company because i was so impressed.
i have never seen movers move as fast as these guys! we only needed two guys and we we lucky to get kevin and joey very nice guys.  they provided follow up calls to confirm the move the day before and another call on moving day to give us their arrival time.            job well done and total move was done in two hours.   we highly recommend them!
great experience with my move cross town yesterday.  kevin and joey were professional, hard working and all around top notch movers.  no time wasted...than even ran from the truck to the house on occasion.  all business, but courteous, and good value. they made it easy for me so money well spent.  would use them again.
ok people. heres the skinny. this is the first half of my review since they did a split move to our temporary digs and to storage and will complete the move when our house is built in six months. these guys were great !! you need to look no further imo. not only did they do a great job of moving us but the beat all others in the bid by 2030. the owners, anthony and kevin came out with their crew. kevin stayed with his crew even though he was under the weather. they humped for two 12 hour days, hardly taking a break. i went our for pizza for them so they could continue to work. a great bunch of guys and worked in spite of a huge monsoon that hit on the second day. that didnt slow them down a bit.ill post part two of my review when we do the second half of the move.
we found poindexter on groupon. anthony and joe were amazing! super fast, professional and friendly. poor anthony was even allergic to cats which we have and it didnt low him down a bit! and they were short a guy but still made awesome time!we will definitely use them next time we move. thanks for making the difficult process of moving sooooo much easier! : juan and jenelle
we found poindexter on yelp.  chose them because their ratings were good and they did not disappoint.  very professional with quoting and scheduling.  they even called to let us know they were running 5 minutes late for their arrival.  the move went smoothly.  they did a great job, and took care of our belongings.  i would definitely recommend.  thank you tek and crew for a job well done.
joe, jake, and jessee were great! they didnt waste any time and took great care of my stuff! job well done!
today we moved and we couldnt be happier with poindexter. they were excellent. joey, tye, and tek were accurate, friendly, efficient, and best of all they had a great attitude! it rained today but that didnt slow them down. i would highly recommend them!
poindexter moving company is the best; they were quick and efficient. i am very pleased with the service i received and the price i paid was even better. if you are planning to move use poindexter moving company and you wont  be disappointed. thanks, tek, matt, and joey for everything. you guys made my move very easy and stress free.
i had a peaceful experience moving... totally stress free!!!  kevin and mike treated me with so much kindness and respect. ive moved many times in my life.. over 30 in 20 years and this was hands down the best move and i actually had fun! there is no way i would use anyone else in the future! if i could give more than 5 stars i would!!! its good to see caring young men, that watched out for me and worked smart!!! i was a little scared to be alone with movers in the past ... i was totally at ease with these two movers!!
cant say enough about this company, from the initial booking to the actual move. i was referred to them by a storage facility in scottsdale. when the movers joe  anthony showed up you can instantly tell they knew what they were doing. they take much pride in what they do  they are hard working. if i ever have to move again they will my first choice.
so amazing. i cant recommend this company enough. from customer service to the logistics of moving an entire household across town, theyre 5 star. kevin brings a professionalism to the table thats unmatched. again, i cant say enough about this company and how pleasurable they make a moving experience.
poindexter was recommended by a coworker that had used them before. this was my first time i hired movers and i wanted to make sure to find someone who takes good care and has reasonable prices. i have to say this was absolutely the right choice. no stress for me at all. kevin, joey and ty where absolutely wonderful. they wrapped and moved all of my furniture and the rest of my household. they worked efficient and were cautious. all three of them were great. they got the job done in less than 4 hours. i absolutely recommend them. keep up the great work and customer service. thanks for saving me.
i am very impressed with their service!matt and ty went over and beyond to make sure i was pleased with everything. they made sure furniture was wrapped and was taken care off and also that they did not go over the time i was able to pay for.this was the most affordable move i have ever done i saved 50 compared to my last move for extraordinary movers.well done highly recommended this company!!
this moving company is wonderful.  they helped me out when i was in a jam, with convenience, smiles and help with my close schedule.joey and jake were fabulous!i would hire both of them in a flash.  they emptied three medium pods in two hours and broke nothing thank you poindexter moving joey and jake!
i ordered two sandwiches.  both were made properly, and my order was delivered in under ten minutes.
as of this writing, this jimmy johns location is 3 weeks old.  i was shocked to see it as i whisked by. shocked in a good way, cuz the subway shop across the street by bashas is sub par for subway.its a bustling, slightly crowded, landlocked strip mall on the ne side of power and mcdowell, right before you head north for tubing or before you head east to do some cycling or catch the 202 south. its pretty much adjacent to the las sendas neighborhood.i went at 12:30pm on a thursday and, as i ordered a turkey tom with cheese and sprouts, the kids got busy making it. by the time i paid 2 min later, the sandwich was practically made. fast service for sure. smiles a plenty.theres a comfy, long barheight table, where you can sit and eat. there are little booth seats as well where you can sit. its a typical jimmy johns. theres not a ton of room to grab drinks if youre in a power chair or wheel chair.location note: its so incredibly sad that this strip mall doesnt take advantage of the huge mountain views it has behind it. im sorry there are no second story floors with windows but, thats not jimmy johns fault. the developers shot themselves in the foot.  so, just walk outside and look up before you take off. just saying. great spot if you like the outdoors.i snapped a photo which ill try to post from the starbucks drive thru on the nw corner of power and mcdowell staring over at this jimmy johns behind cvs. its a beacon now, sitting a store or two over from smash burger and chipotle :
its a jimmy johns. the people who take the orders and make the sandwiches are friendly and efficient. the sandwiches are the same you get at any jjs, they are assembled incredibly quickly, and the soda machine has been working each time ive gone in. the tables are clean and so are the bathrooms.for me, thats 5 stars for a sandwich place like this.note: i have never ordered for delivery since i live about a mile away and i can use the exercise.
so happy this place opened!! kevin is the best owner of any pawn shop ive ever been...no games and lowballing..awesome looking and great stuff inside for awesome prices!! come check it out!
i was looking to sell my rolex and went to a few jewelry stores in the old town area. they all pretty much offered the same price give or take a few hundred dollars. i never would have thought a pawn shop would pay more than the fancy jewelry stores, but this one did. glad i gave this place a shot, will definitely be back.
i dont usually venture into pawn shops but i didnt know where else to sell my moms mixed jewelry. i had no idea what my stuff was worth so i shopped around and compared prices. this place gave me the best price i could find. much appreciated. thank you.
definitely one of the better pawn shops around town. kevinowner helped me out. seemed like an honest man with fair prices.. and i have a soft spot for local businesses. thanks again.
funny, i had the exact same experience as the first reviewer, except my pulled pork sandwich was spectacular enough that im not docking lacys score for what amounts to soft opening day jitters. smoked pork was great and in abundance, barely contained by the bun, while sauce was almost unnecessary as the meat was incredibly juicy and flavorful; sides were fine, standard smokehouse fare. thrilled to have this additional bbq option in downtown urbana we really have an embarrassment of riches in that regard. im looking forward to sampling more from their menu. i dont care if theyve figured out the register or not.
i am taking in to account that this eatery has recently opened. i know theres still logistical kinks to work out, so i will have to return again to review that. right now this review is purely food and service based. i ordered the chicken and brisket 2 meat combo. the chicken was by far my favorite out of the two, but that doesnt mean the brisket was sub par in any way. the bbq sauce was delish. i dont usually eat too much of the bread in order to keep room for meat. in this case i was eating the bread just to get more sauce after i had finished all my meat. mind you, im barely 5ft tall and teetering over 100 lbs and cleared my combo plate. thats how good it was. the service was phenomenal. the staff constantly checked in on us to make sure we were satisfied.the restaurant seats about 25 people and they do have take out.
every time ive been in here, the staff has been super nice and the food has been super good. i can personally vouch for the quality of the polish sausage, the pulled pork, the rib tips, and the beef brisket; all of em are great and of the equivalents ive had better than black dogs. service is also way better: food is prepared and served very quickly, everybodys really friendly, and the staff checks in frequently to see how the food is and if you need anything.all in all, a great place, and each visit has been a more pleasant experience than any ive ever had at bd. as long as this little gem is in town, i wont be going anywhere else for my barbecue.
we were just walking by when we decided to hop in for lunch. amazing nice people and bbq sauce is outstanding. ribs melted in your mouth and gear home made potato salad. owner stopped by our table to check on us and was so sweet!
excellent barbecue. loved the ribs and rib tips. try the pineapple slaw. great beans and mac and cheese.  downtown urbana
rib tips and collard greens! yes!
i was fortunate to have been invited for a private event tonight before their grand opening tomorrow and i was overwhelmed by the overall experience but most importantly the gelato.  i never thought it was possible, but the gelato is even better than before.  the chocolate gelato is phenomenal and for those lactose intolerant it is made with water, that is right, water.  throughout the night, guests were treated to horderves, gelatology, liquid gelatology, champagne and her phenomenal gelato. the offerings of her gelatology were amazing mixes of gelato, sauces and other accompaniments.  fat elvis was my favorite. stepping up a notch with an organic tart cherry homemade soda and liquid cookies and cream gelato; i was almost full.  but i was given a 16 oz. serving of chocolate, lemon pound cake, dulce leche cafe with chocolate and rosemary creme brulee. finished and after saying goodbye to the desyree and her husband i sauntered home knowing now i can bring friends and clients back to the best gelato ever.
when desyree alberganti closed the doors of her original art of flavors on february 28, 2015, her gelato fans near and far were heartbroken.  almost six months later, happy days are here again!  today is the grand opening of desys new gelateria and its like she never left.i was fortunate to attend a friends and family sneak peek last night with some other friends where desy, her husband luigi, and the rest of the family welcomed all with open arms and lots of gelato plus other treats on the menu.  gelato flavors in the case last night:peanut butterchocolatestrawberries n creampear and gorgonzolarosemary creme bruleenutella rocky roaddulce de leche  chocolatecookies n creamfiori di lattesorbetto flavors, all glutenfree and vegan:chocolate mango passion fruitcoconutwe had a chance to sample the fat elvis:  peanut butter gelato, strawberry, banana compote, bacon candy, and peanutsas well as the boscaiola:  raspberry sorbetto, mint pesto, and fruit.a new item is the organic dark tart cherry soda, also gluten free and vegan.  desy is also serving up pastries, espresso, cappuccino, affogato, and shakes with a gelato base.come see what youve been missing if youve never had this gelato and welcome back to those whove been waiting.  were happy youve returned, desy!gelatosorbetto prices:4 oz.  46 oz  5.5012 oz.  716 oz.  8.50
this is the same owner as a place called arts of flavor that was located near charleston and lv blvd but closed beginning of this year. but no worries as the owner, desyree alberganti, is back with the greatest and best gelato creations around and in a great new location!as i walked in and i was quickly greeted with smiles and welcomes, the display cases are just a few steps in the door, one showing cookies and a few pastrys and the other the famous gelato creations! today was:gelato flavors:peanut butterchocolatestrawberries n creampear and gorgonzolarosemary creme bruleenutella rocky roaddulce de leche  chocolatecookies n creamfiori di lattesorbetto flavors, all glutenfree and vegan:chocolate mango passion fruitcoconutgelatosorbetto prices:4 oz.  46 oz  5.5012 oz.  716 oz.  8.50i tasted the peanut butter, nutella rocky road and gulce de leche all fantastic but was caught my eye was the signage behind the counter stating a fat elvis  peanut butter gelato, strawberry, banana compote, bacon candy, and peanuts, i was quickly sold on this and certainly lived up to the taste of all these ingredients! simply amazing! there are several small 2 and 4 seat tables throughout the establishment. they also sever espresso and some teas. i will certainly be back as this place is simply the best when it comes to creating gelato flavors and they do change on a regular basis.
so happy to have found this place again! i was heartbroken she. art of flavor closed, but so excited to learn that my favorite gelato spot has reopened!
and shes back! gelato flavors both funky nutella rocky road and traditional chocolate sorbetto plus new gelato creations fat elvis  she had me at bacon. photos not available since we gobbled it down before i could snap any photos. it was that good. 4 for a small cup but worth every penny.
were so glad desyree is back! her gelato is always delicious and creative. we drive 2030 minutes to get to this new location, but we would drive further without hesitation.
perfect!! delicious like always.. super happy its nearby our house. desyree is always so welcoming and happy to see her customers.
today was a gelato day. i had three servings today at three places and i must say it is so great to be back at a place by desyree!i even mistakenly went to the art of flavors today thinking she reopened the place as i heard she was opening up but i didnt pay attention. so back at her new place i am absolutely happy to be here. i will not describe at all the type of flavors but the experience. 1.  greeting you automatically feel at home with warm welcomes from the entire team. it is both inviting and heartfelt. 2.  the tryout all the flavors are created and you will be invited to try many and to experience flavors and mixtures only the most creative chef can imagine. it is so fun to experience this explosion of daring creativity. 3.  the taste the only way to describe this is   comfort food at its best. not saying that gelato is comfort food but if you ever just felt so good having spaghetti, or that feeling of having fried chicken or moms apple pie, that same feeling is what you will get here at gelatology!  you feel at home here and the taste is número uno. gk says come on back and enjoy!
its like the new and improved art of flavors. this is seriously some of the best gelato you will ever have. ever. wherever you live around town, this is worth the drive. my friend, who used to live in italy, even declared desyrees gelato better than what she had in italy. if thats not a glowing endorsement, i dont know what is. its a cute, small shop with a couple of tables for eating inside. there are lots of rotating flavors of gelato to choose from, everything from strawberry, to green tea kit kat, to pear and gorgonzola, to... well, i could go on forever. be bold and adventurous in your choices. and you are welcome to taste any many flavors as you want. which, of course, really only makes the decisions more difficult. everything always tastes so good. and so many of the flavors are so completely unique. there are also shakes and sundaelike combos available these combos add additional flavors and textures like bananas and bacon. in sum, if youre craving a cold treat, youve got to come here.
whelp, shes back yall! if you havent already heard the good news, desyree is back with her fantabulous gelato and sorbettos and more. rejoice!!nothing has changed about the product and the location is so, so much better. same great flavors youve come to love; for me, thats lemon pound cake, pistachio, green tea kit kat, pear  gorgonzola, and chocolate sorbetto. its gelato perfection; the creamy texture and true embodiment of flavors. i also enjoy the flavor selection, especially the unique creations. new to desyrees repertoire is liquid gelato, coppe, housemade soda, and confections. the liquid gelato 6.50 is just as it sounds: its gelato thats shaken with ice to create a drinkable version. there are five flavor options at the moment. its fantastic. i mean, like we need a way to consume gelato even faster! the housemade soda is awesome. we tried the organic dark tart cherry 3.75 and it is delicious. there will be more unique flavors in the future! as far as the other treats, ive only tried the alfajores, a delicate latin american cookie with dulce le leche and coconut  delicious! its so soft and light; my type of cookie.gelato and sorbettoquattro 4 oz: 4sei 6 oz: 5.50dodici 12 oz: 7sedici 16 oz: 8.50the good: its so close to home. the bad: its so close to home.

how lucky am i to have been visiting vegas the same week chef desyree opens gelatology?  who needs slot machines?  i hit the jackpot, you guys! ;first impressions  location is great!  its sharing a center with a grocery store and a couple of restaurants, so parking is a breeze.  everything looks upgraded from the signage to the chefs coat.  the interior looks so vibrant and fresh!  anyway, thats enough about the buildingdecor, lets talk about some delicious gelato!the same amazing gelato in a different shell.  we tasted several different flavors: rosemary creme brulee, lemon pound cake omg, cookies and cream, pistachio, bread pudding, and green tea kit kat.  every gelato is a perfect embodiment of the flavor its inspired from.  its literally like eating a better version of what its based on.now onto queen desy!  i wish i could just steal her and bring her to los angelesbut ill just keep dreaming.  its so refreshing to meet someone whos so passionate about their craft, and it shows in each and every bite.  truly one of the sweetest people i have ever met.  its always a pleasure visiting and having a chat with her. :i cant wait to visit vegas again to delve deeper into the menu.  we were just so blindsided by her return that we only focused on the gelato.  well see you soon, desy!
the gelato goddess is back in business! desyree was the heart and soul of art of flavors, and now has her own shop, complete with the muchmissed gelato, and new fun stuff like baked goods and liquid gelato. she still rocks some of the classic flavors like green tea kit kat and pear  gorgonzola, but also features daily specials and experimental new flavors.if you want something different, the fat elvis sundae peanut butter gelato, strawberry, banana compote, bacon candy, and peanuts is a treat, but im a traditionalist samples until i find what speaks to me, then a small cup all to myself!im thrilled for desyree and her new shop the service is sweeter than ever and our favorite frozen treats are back! this isnt just a mustvisit place, this is where you must be a regular.
not sure ill add much to the 5 star reviews  look up art of flavors and see the glowing reviews.there are people who literally went daily.  now that this is 510 minutes from where i live, ill be coming here much more often.  everything here is the goods!  come here  come here often!
omg this place is the bomb!!! so today is so hot and ice cream is the best way to get over it. so many options of flavor. the guy who seems the owner definitely accomodated me and my mom, he gave us a lot of samples of their flavors! their tiramisu cake is so delicious. its creamy and theres like a coffee taste in it. i like their interior designs too. glad we tried this place, good thing its near my house! ill be a regular customer here!!
we werent sure desyree would remember us but she did!  she came out from behind the glass hugged us both and even remembered my husband cant have dairy!  her flavors were amazing as usual! were so happy shes back!
check this place out when you get the chance because its the best gelato in las vegas. come for the gelato but stay for the experience. at gelatology the owner desyree has mastered the art of gelato making the most creative assortment. you wont be disappointed!
take it all, gelatology!!!! my house, my money, my dog, my friends. take. it. all. thats the kind of crazy talk this place will get you saying after eating their gelato. hands down, nothing comes close to the quality, amazing texture, perfect balance of sweetness, and the unique flavors they offer here. its the best gelato ive had in my lyfe!!!!! i got to try a good sample, and their enthusiasm for trying their flavors was contagious. i got the:pear and gorgonzola cheese 5 stars. sounds weird and it was sooooooo amazing.strawberries and cream 5 stars awesome. mille foglie dulce de leche 5 stars fantastic.espresso chocolate with caramel 5 stars. everything blew me away. i think the pear and gorgonzola was my favorite only because its such a weird concept yet so genius. we got the super large size and got all these flavors. this place is going to have a line out the door and then sum in a few months. ill never go anywhere else for gelato after this.
im so excited and happy to see desyree back in business. what she does with the gelato is truly an art.if you havent tried her gelato you have go to asap!
brand new place with endless varieties of gelato flavors! i love how they have flavors that other places do not have. i am so glad this is by our house now and we will definitely be regulars!
this is going to be a really long read, so here are my quick tips for enjoying gelatology: absolutely avoid being full before coming here, sample all the gelato flavors, try not to mix intense flavors with subtle flavors, make sure to use a gelato spoon instead of a broader white plastic spoon, get larger cup sizes.you might say that downtown las vegass loss is the southwests gain, but the big picture is that everyone in town can rejoice over having desyrees gelato again or for the first time, for some slackers.desyree alberganti was the driving force behind the renowned art of flavors, which yelpers may recall is ranked at 2 on yelps list of the top 100 places in the entire country to try in 2015 thanks to a stratospheric rating average from 2014s reviews. after her sad departure from that business due to unavoidable circumstances, she has opened her own place in under half a year.and what a place it is. it should be highlighted that the shared parking lot is much larger than that awkward triangular area outside aof. the neighborhood here has a much safer feel too. as for gelatology itself, it seems much more welcoming inside. the music is significantly more top 40 than the old radiostation piggyback, and it blares not too loudly from a centrally located speaker. the interior decor has much brighter colors than aof did. part of the wall in the seating area is brightly colored in a way resembles some frozen yogurt shops, and the chairs are cushioned instead of just hard and wooden.posters on that wall explain desyrees vision for gelatology. i originally had no idea what she was doing with the cumbersome name, but it clicked when i read that its based on gelotology, an actual term for the study of laughter. im a big fan of wordplay, and it perfectly represents the enjoyment witnessed when desyree and her employees interact with customers young and notasyoung alike. the logo is cute too.the menu at gelatology now includes takes on sundaes, shakes, and even pastries displayed in a case next to the front door. the dessert paninis arent around yet, but a little birdy told me that they will be back and better than ever. the gelato case holds 18 flavors. a quick glance at old aof photos suggests that it might be a slight reduction in options, but it looks like each slot holds a unique flavor now whereas there were occasionally duplicates in her former shop. therefore, the selection is either the same or barely decreased.i was actually quite underwhelmed during my first visit due to various circumstances being full from dinner, getting free samples of many things, feeling a bit rushed by my companion, not using a gelato spoon, but my taste buds found familiar and new treats today. after this second try, im now fully confident that the same consistent, creamy gelato base is back and perhaps better than ever.a breakdown of gelato flavors that ive had so far: i loved the brand new flavors of apple fritter a great take on typically heavy donut shop fare and mille foglie dulce de leche bits of the pastry also known as mille feuille or napoleon lending its ubiquitous flavor. rosemary creme brulee, an iteration on elements of old favorites, is also a success in my book. the cookie butter and pistachio have the same great flavor as always, as does the chocolate sorbetto. this chocolate actually now has an airy texture that you typically dont get from a milkfree dessert. desyree credits this change to having exact temperature control, unlike at her old digs. espresso chocolate w caramel is nice, but the coffee can get drowned out in a cup w other strong flavors. personally, i could go without the bomboloni my companions choice, and the dark cherry gelato sample seemed very light in flavor at the time. no envelopepushing savory flavors yet, but im sure theyll make an appearance soon enough.the new products are at least worth exploring. the house soda, which has a dark tart cherry flavor, is actually a pleasant and refreshing beverage. its not bubbly like some would expect from the name, but the flavor is balanced. its my favorite new offering thus far. however, the baked goods have yet to impress. the palmier aka ventaglio isnt as buttery as id like, and both the nutella biscuit and the dulce de leche and coconut flavored alfajor seem to offer more in texture than in flavor. i havent tried the mille foglie or the tiramisu yet, but i will eventually. those two seem to be the most promising.fortunately, desyrees gelato still has a combination of value, consistent texture, sugar balance, and varietyinnovation that isnt quite met by las vegass other best gelato shops. add in excellent hospitality customer service being too formal and you get a winning recipe. i just wish it wasnt so far from me! id know id be here all the time if i could reach it in 15 minutes or less. i suppose the inconvenience is best for my pancreas...
ah yes....finally got the pleasure to try desyrees fabulous gelato. my boyfriend and i went during their grand opening weekend. the minute we walked in, we felt their sincere welcome. without hesitation, desyree and her male partner started giving us samples after samples. i had my heart set on green tea kit kat but i didnt see it on display. kinda bummed, i told desyree i was looking thru the yelp pictures and really wanted to try the green tea kit kat. she told me she had some left in the back!!!! my eyes and heart lit up!!! in the end, my boyfriend got the flavor of the day: cinnamon roll and of course i got my green tea kit kat!!! it was delish!! i love the creamy consistency and it wasnt overly sweet. i got the small sized cup and my boyfriend got the medium...our total was around 9.50. the small sized is perfect to satisfy any sweet cravings you may have. the cup may look tiny, but she packs on the scoop!!! well def be back. im very curious to try her other flavors....like pistachio or mint n chips! yum!!!! 
i loved this place when they were in downtown under a different name and i love it even more now that it is close to my house! the decor is modern and a huge upgrade from their first location. the gelato is amazing. i got the smallest size    and it was the perfect size to not overdo it. i originally didnt think i could finish it because i thought it would be too sweet after awhile but boy was i wrong. i could have licked it clean. we tried the apple fritter which tasted exactly like an apple fritter, the fruit loop which had fruit loops mixed in and was also delicious but a little on the sweet side for me i also just tasted the vegan chocolate because it looked amazing and it was spot on for chocolate and hard to believe it was vegan. gelatology is absolutely a treat and something i will look forward to trying again soon! everything here is so delicious!!
if you want gelato and you go anywhere else... well that is your loss. this place rocks.
this is still the best ice cream place youll find in vegas. im so happy desyree reopened quick! she still makes the same unique flavors that everyone misses.
my siblings and i use to trek all the way to the strip, just to get some gelato.  not anymore!  this place is just around the corner from my dads house.  met desyree who is friendly.  had a few samples which were all tasty.  in the end, i had the nutella cake wchocolate and almonds.  super good.  its my 1st time coming in here, and it wont be my last.
no reason to go to the art of flavors downtown ever again!!  we checked out the new spot today and it is great. there are so many interesting flavors like fruit loop, raspberry kit kat, salted caramel and her original pear and gorgonzola. of course she let us taste all the flavors that we wanted before we decided.
all the goodness of art of flavors is back, better than ever. dont worry, you can still sample everything and still have a hard time making up your mind.  : the new location is great for locals, plenty of parking and easy to find within the shopping center.
ive been here three times in the last three weeks and have not been disappointed. my favorite flavor is pistachio baklava. other good ones passion fruit and green tea kit kat. honestly everything ive tried has been awesome. they make all their gelato from scratch  no mixes and you can tell. best gelato ive had outside of rome! check their instagram for flavors of the day, it constantly changes.
love it!  great flavors all around and the owners are great, wholesome people!  definitely check it out.  you wont regret it!
oh sweet lord! i think ive found a place to satisfy my craving for sweet things.i first heard of gelatology from my cousin, who told me about it before they opened their doors officially. its right near a coffee shop called serenade, where we frequent often for a place to study. im glad she took me here because everything about this place is spot on!when we entered, we were greeted right away. the interior was bright, fun, and enticing  a perfect fit for a gelato shop! the guy behind the counter happily explained the process of making gelato along with giving me and my cousin a tasting tour of all the different flavors available.among my favorites that i tasted were the strawberries n cream, pear and gorgonzola, and the fior di latte which i heard is the traditional, authentic flavor in italy. initially, i thought flavors like the pear and gorgonzola werent going to be good, but was proven wrong when i ate the samples. i ended up going with the strawberries n cream flavor because i wanted something slightly sweet.i felt like the tastes of the gelato were true to their labels. it literally tasted like what they were advertised as, so i wasnt let down when they gave us a sample of each flavor.they also have a small baked goods section, which i chose a nutella biscuit to munch on. the biscuit was so good, but i feel like it would be better paired with coffee or some other hot drink.with a unique array of flavors that not all gelato shops have, i think gelatology did not disappoint. i cant wait to come back for more!
desyree is back!she was the heart  soul of art of flavors  they made the biggest mistake ever as they will most likely go out of business without this lady! when i saw my fellow yelpers talking about her opening up her own place i couldnt wait to see her  once again having her magical gelato! bold flavors that are creamy  so addictive! on my first visit i had to go with some of my favorites like extra virgin olive oil and pear  gorgonzola. i missed these gelatos so much! having them again brought back all the old great memories of bringing my friends over so they could try desyrees unique flavors! every single person becoming a fan! im thrilled shes back in business  i cant wait to try some of my other favorites like sweet cream  spicy chocolate!
this place is so good! the service is excellent. the moment you walk in their store they immediately make you feel so at home. they are so attentive! i love love this place so much! its awesome how they always have different flavors everyday. my favorite by far is the green tea kitkat! amazing!
i loved art of flavors when desyree was there, but thank god shes on her own now with gelatology. the best thing is that its less than 10 minutes from home now. desyree still makes the best gelato and sorbetto! i can literally go here everyday without getting tired of their gelato. my favorites so far include the sweet corn, cinnamon toast crunch, rose petals, rice pudding, ugh i cant possible list them all. the service is still 5 stars! i cant wait to see what else desyree has in stock for us.
i finally get it.ive been wanting to try desyrees creations since art of flavors, but never had the opportunity to make it down there.gelatology is so close to my house, i made it a point yesterday to let my fiance know that i wanted to try it asap...so after dinner, we stopped in.first of all, the location is small, bright, and very clean.  ill be honest, i didnt get a look at the full menu, i was too distracted by the gelato!she has a smallish, but amazing selection of flavors, and was more than willing to let us sample whatever we wanted.  flavors like dark cherry, creme brulee, salted caramel, lemon meringue pie, and the incredible pear and gorganzola cheese gelato.  they were all amazing.  i ended up getting the 6 oz creme brulee, and only ate half of it.  she really packs a lot of gelato into that little cup!!!  she has her savory flavors on fridays and saturdays, so i have every intention of stopping by either tonight or tomorrow for a little taste!excellent service, excellent product, fantastic location.  i cant wait to go back!!
amazing gelato. must go !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hmmmm friendly staff . they let you try whatever flavor you wanna try . new flavors daily .
this gelato is excellent and worth the drive from north lasvegas.  we tried raspberry sorbetto, cookies and cream gelato, and strawberry sorbetto. the portions are very generous and the service is excellent. you can try as many flavors as you want and they dont make you feel rushed to make a decision. you are able to mix flavors in one serving. cant wait to come back.
its like eating a cloud of sweet goodness! best gelato hands down! nice variety, everything is fresh and handmade at the shop. delicious!
initially, i came into this store because my friends were raging about how good it was and honestly...it really was! as we walked in, we were greeted by the owner and workers! they were so welcoming by asking how our day was and if it was our first time there. we said yes its our first time and they started pulling out samples of every flavor! the guy explained that they change flavors every day and that they keep making new flavors. so basically, its a like a new surprise of flavors every time you visit! out of all the samples, i finally picked the flavor soursop. its a fruit the grows in tropical places and growing up in hawaii....i used to eat this all the time! this flavor brought back so many memories and it was so good. what i also like about this place is that they have an instagram and facebook account. they post what flavors will be featured that day, so you wont be going into the store blind. youll at least get a hint of what flavors would be there that day. i love this place and i will continue to come here for gelato!
my 600th review had to be something special.  gelatology fits the bill!its a cute shop with a variety of flavors and other desserts.  i dont know if ill ever get to try them since im focused on the gelato flavors.  the creatively talented desyree has forever redefined gelato.  evoo, black sesame, fried chicken  waffles are just a few creations youll find.  ive had her gelato before and loved it.  it is still just amazing and delicious.  i had a cup of black sesame and cookie butter.   oh im in heaven.  creamy but light, delectable and savory.  i had a taste of my friends raspberry sorbet and evoo.  the tart mixed with the sweet really made a great combo.  im sure you couldnt go wrong with any selection.  desyree is simply lovely.  the personal service is displayed with every customer.  they welcome you into their world with open arms and never let go.  gelatology is worth all of the excitement and praise.
gelatology has brightened up the dessert landscape in the southwest and im happy to reap the benefits. desyree is back and better than ever. excellent customer service, check. excellent product, check. and now you can add excellent location to make it a dessert trifecta.the shop is small but wellorganized and located in the corner of an up and coming mini mall location. as always, she is letting her creative juices flow with all her inventive gelato and pastry creations. sample as many as you like before committing, shes happy to let you try them all. i havent tried a flavor i didnt enjoy yet. as always, my favorite is still the pear and gorgonzola, but i have tried a number of other daily specials and theyre all superb. im so glad to have gelatology open up so much closer to home. its dangerous, but ill deal.
yay! shes back!!! everything tastes great as usual, i have yet to be disappointed. now that they have moved to the southwest there are some benefits...better parking, more variety shakes, italian sodas, macaroons, baked goods!, and a more family friendly area. unfortunately this is further from my home, but its definitely worth the trek! ill be sure to tell all my friends to come here and experience some exceptional desserts!
shes back!!!! i thought how would this be any different than desyrees last place but with the addition of some pastries and some new flavors to the gelato, she just keeps amazing everyone! a small shop with plenty of parking it is a perfect fit to the area. it is a little out of my way but that will not be an issue, well worth a drive from anywhere in the valleyi tries several flavors and they were all as impressive as i remember. it seemed like she was closed for much longer than she really was. just sampling those wonderful gelatos brought me back to my happy place. i wish her the best and will see her very soon
finally! a dessert store that sells real goood gelato! very welcoming staff members.  was welcomed by the owner. the owner walked us through all the flavors, and gave us samples of each one! score! he was in no rush and took his time with us to explain what ingredients were in certain flavors.  to me, alll flavors are great! the ingredients are fresh and to savor! we will definitely be coming back. a plus since we live right around the block!
im so excited that this has opened here in spring valley.  my husband and i went in here to check it out last week. the owner and her father were working behind the counter.  she was so enthusiastic about here desserts and explained all the flavors to us. everything looked amazing.  i got the creme brulee gelato and i my husband got the cinamon rolls gelato. both were delicious. we sampled a few flavors before choosing and honestly,  it was all good. we will be back often. i started following them on instagram so that i can see their daily post of with their flavors of the day are. its a must try.
owner was very detailed and knowledgeable with his flavors. green tea kit kat and raspberry sorbet were really good. the smell of waffle cones is extremely pleasing as you walk in. the flavors are rich and interesting. will be here more often!
love love love it here!! super affordable and a wide variety of flavors. amazing customer service and just a wonderful place to go!
hands down the best gelato of my life!i went here with both of my kids, and the owner was so sweet about letting them try different flavors! it was super appreciated by this busy mom. i went for the snickers and green tea kit kat, my kids had the cookies and cream. i cant think of one thing wrong. it was all good. the kids persuaded me to buy some macaroons too. i regret nothing.take my !
so happy that she opened up her gelato shop.  when i found out art of flavors was closed down i literally felt my heart break a little.  this is the best gelato in vegas!  green tea white chocolate kit kat along with the other flavor of the days is what makes this place unique.the only downfall is not having the convenience of eating an arepa beforehand next door from the old location.  but this location is a lot safer so thats a good thing.i dont really know what else to say other than my heart is singing once again lol
desyree does it again with her new shop.love the new flavors daily, which range from sweet and traditional to savory and interesting.she is very patient and sweet with all her customers, providing all the samples you would like!its well worth the drive off the strip or from any area of vegas to get the best gelato in the valley.a must stop whenever i am in las vegas!
what a nice treat!! :  we enjoyed the coffee, salted caramel, and chocolate gelatos with a latte to go with it.  you cant find a better place for gourmet homemade gelatossorbetspastries!  well be back again soon!
how can i not give them 5 stars. upon arrival i was greeted right away. they could tell i was a newbie in the place, and a nice gentleman handed me, and my nephews tasting spoons. if youre interested in a flavor, youre able to sample. i had to go here for the infamous green tea kit kat flavor and it did not disappoint. you can clearly taste the flavors, even on a small sample spoon. i just want to come back every day to try a new flavor lol.
this place is better than the gelato i had in rome a few months ago! there are really no words to describe how delectable each of the flavors are! so happy to have found this place and its soo close to my inlaws.
this place is so good! different flavors everyday! you can sample all the flavors!love how friendly the owner is!yummmy!
unique flavors and fresh ingredients. the gelato is made from scratch everyday and each day there is a flavor of the day, so there is always something new. the owner desyree is so sweet and lets you taste as many flavors as your heart desires without getting annoyed. i think it makes her happy when others enjoy her delicious creations!  i got the lemon meringue. it was refreshing and had crust crumbs mixed within. delicious! the bf got the nutella and he ate it clean! coming from a strict calorie counter, this is definitely worth the calories!
this place is awesome, unique flavored gelato, you can taste the freshness, full flavored gelato. i love the ube flavor, yes ube flavor and nutella. over 10 flavors served fresh. ill be coming in with my wife and 2 boys again. bring your family and friends here, great place to chill on a hot day. you wont regret it. and the portions is very generous, i mean packed to  the top. great staff, very clean and comfortable.
i traveled to the west discover a remarkable gelato shop!!! i was familiar with desyrees owner creativity from the art of flavors from which she left to pursue her own endeavors, so i was happy when i found out she finally opened up her new shop. based on that, i already knew going inside i was going to be enticed with delicious yumminess!!! gelatology  has lots of various artiisan gelatos, italian dessert, crafted sodas and daily baked items. the gelatos start out from a base, and then they are customized from their. i cant wrap my head around the unique flavor combinations, something you have to discover for yourself.my favorites:creme brulee cinnamon toast crunchfior de latte the gelatology which is pear, gorgonzola cheese, caramelized walnuts  opporto sciroppo which is red wine reduced to syrup.highly recommend!!
if youve been to art of flavors, then you already know that chef desyree is the baddest chef in town!  she is truly an artist when it comes to gelato  everything she makes is inventive, delicious, and as cheesy as it sounds...made with love.the new location is further from my place, so i dont go as much as before, but its totally worth the drive.  some flavors i love: fior di latte spelling?  the simple plain base flavor is delicious, pear and blue cheese sounds crazy but its awesome!, fig and balsamic same, spicy cheetos yes, i just said that, spicy chocolate  soooo very good.  im headed there tonight to go try the bananas foster. nomnomnommy boyfriend loves the peanut butter im allergic sadly, but it smells very peanutbuttery and all the standard flavors  chocolate, anything with cookies in it, etc.  she makes this gelato panini he loves  its peanut butter gelato and jelly on bread, pressed in a panini maker.  i know  mind...blown.like i said  this place is awesome and so is chef desyree.
items tasted:fried doughhouse sodas  passion fruit, black cherry, mintpeach sorbetto, dark chocolate sorbetto, pear and gorgonzola gelato, ube gelato, vietnamese coffee gelato, passion fruit cream gelato, rice pudding gelato, cinnamon roll gelato, creme brulee gelato, peanut butter gelato, tiramisu gelato, malted milk gelato, dark tart cherry gelatopeanut butter gelato smallvietnamese coffee gelato smallrice pudding gelato, cinnamon roll gelato smallstepping away from a truly memorable meal at le cirque with family still chatting a marvelous first day in las vegas a stop at gelatology seemed almost prerequisite, and with owner desyree alberganti  proving the consummate hostess a bakers dozen samples again showed the creamiest of bases imbued with exquisite flavors, the new soda program and deep fried dough doused in powdered sugar helping to cleanse palates between bites while pastries again beckoned inside the windowside case.obviously continuing to offer signatures as yet untasted by my visitors, the peanut butter, coffee, and dark chocolate all impressing them as much as it has locals for years, new innovations including malted milk, ube, and dark tart cherry all proved equally enthralling with three cups ordered in the smallest of sizes only because little stomach capacity was left after a long day of eating, the blend of cinnamon roll and rice pudding a best of both worlds sort of pairing that saw each complimented by the other with a flavor that came across like a snickerdoodle cookie with more subtlety.   still unblemished after tasting nearly one hundred flavors i remain convinced that although i still favor ice cream there is no other gelato id rather enjoy than that made by desyree.
best gelato in vegas and i like the new location a lot better than the sketchy area of art of flavors! gelato messina was my sub in after art of flavors closed, but gelatology definitely has a much creamier in texture.  the variety of flavors is more limited but i think more creative than gelato messina.  we tried the halo halo and green tea kit kat gelato and both were amazing!  i cant wait for my next trip out here!  i noticed they also have additional desserts available now, like cookies and macarons, etc.
so happy we found desyree from art of flavors! we loved that place when she was there. so many unique flavorssome of my favorites were the corn  rose since i dont have a big sweet tooth and dont like things that are too overwhelmingly sweet.this place is just as good since she still makes everything from scratch but the location is 100x better since i live on the west side and going downtown just feels so grimey sometimes.i love the sorbettos here. vegan, gluten free desserts? yes please! so flavorful but not too sweet. tried the coconut and passion fruit flavors this weekend and they were both amazing! perfect treat to cleanse the palette after eating lunch at soyo just down the street.i will definitely be back and bringing all my out of town guests!
it was my first time coming here! the lady chef explained that how they make this gelato all from scratch everyday! they got very unique flavors and they also have gluten free! i m so glad i found this place!
delicious!! and the owner was so courteous to offer us samples of almost everything! this place exhibits how to open a new spot in lv. unique, quality and great service all around!!
amazing! so glad that this is open. had the purple jalapeno cream cheese and pistachio gelato. so yum together. even if its a trip to go here. i suggest going here!
do i really need to write an extensive review to say how good it is? do i need to say how desyree used to be at art of flavors and has now opened up her own spot? do i also need to say how she combines unique flavors and somehow turns it into delicious gelato? wait never mind, i just did. anyway, this new location is located on rainbow and windmill in the smiths plaza. desyree is the nicest lady ever. she lets you try as many samples as you like and is super patient. the gelato is creamy and smooth and not too sweet. my favorite flavors of all time have been her avocado and ube. but some of her unique flavors have been rosemary  olive oil, foie gras, pear  gorgonzola, and avocado. she does have more normal flavors for the less adventurous like lemon pound cake, cinnamon toast crunch and raspberry kit kat. the flavors change all the time so it gives you a chance to try more. ok we all know this place rocks and isnt in a sketchy area anymore. theres no reason not to visit and get some amazing gelato.
las vegas is filled with what seems like hundreds of tiny strip malls. so many that it seems impossible to investigate the treasures each may hold.  this gelato shop is most definitely a treasure worth seeking out! as a self proclaimed icecreamgelato fanatici will say this is some of the best gelato ive had. ever. period.the flavors range from subtle refreshing sorbets to decadent salted caramels and chocolates; even the occasional avocado or rosemary olive oil. i live in the southwest so im lucky enough to be close by, but would definitely make the trek from anywhere in the city:
first  timer here, located south of the 215 freeway and located in a strip center where there was ample parking. being it was a hot summer evening i was pleased once viewing the gelato selection and the owner introduced herself as she offered me various  samples. the baked items case also caught my eye with macaroons .i ended up selecting the white chocolate gelato with macadamia nuts and a coconut macaroon  both were delish and definitely fixed my sweet tooth.overall a satisfying dessert after dinner. im looking forward to returning next time i visit las vegas.
hands down best gelato in las vegas. had an amazing tour of all the gelato flavors with anthony and got the meet the gelato chef, desiree. cant wait to try all the flavors!
omg never had gelato this good before.  simply amazing!  made fresh by the owner desiree  an award winning gelato chef  number two in the country!   super friendly, extremely good gelatos.  tell them its your first time and they will take you on a tasting tour of their gelatos.   a wow experience.  come. enjoy!
oh my goodness!   this place was fantastic!    my daughter and i walked in at 9 pm on a friday night, store had a nice crowd but we were welcomed immediately by the gentleman working behind the counter.      there were about 15 fresh flavors.. many of which i had no interest of trying.. the gentleman encouraged me to try a variety of mixtures.. and oh my goodness.. they were all fantastic.  service exceptional, choices and flavor exceptional and price.. very very fair.
very good gelato place close to home.  my wife love it so much. first time i see her finish a 2 scoop gelato with a sugar cone. we will be back very soon for other flavors.
these italians are no joke. desyrees gelato is delicious, and they put out different flavors everyday! we were served by a fast talking and hilarious man and couldnt help but buy more than we came for. it was a great experience, and we are more than satisfied with our purchases. will be back for sure!!!
i was so sad when art of flavors closed down downtown.  luckily for me, desyree decided to open up her new spot on my side of town!  now i can get my pear and gorgonzola gelato whenever i please.  the way she makes gelato is absolutely amazing.  another one of my favorites is the green tea kit kat.  check out her instagram gelatologylv to see what she flavors she has for the day!
having this place so close to work is going to be absolutely dangerous! the gelato is absolutely fantastic as is the service. when we arrived, we were greeted by an extremely friendly employee who offered us several samples. everything was so delicious. the prices are very reasonable given the quality of what you get. i will definitely be back often.
delicious! husband got the cookie butter gelato and i got the passion fruit lavender. the lady that rung us out i believe is the owner, she was so sweet and awesome and let us try everything.
i first had chef desyrees gelato at her previous shop called art of flavors. i remember it wasnt particularly a memorable experience. i know its difficult to go in a place with 5 star rating because that sets the bar and expectation high. years later, i am back at her new shop and glad i drove 10 miles for this place. and that really means something because i hate driving. servicewalking in and was immediately greeted by a gentleman. he was generous enough to have us sample almost all the gelato they had on display. i was a little disappointed that they didnt have green tea kit kat that everyone and their dog are raving about. i did get to try pear and gorgonzola that many also talked about, unfortunately didnt quite like the flavor of it. gelatothey have about 20 different flavors which changes daily. all gelato are made fresh with love and care by chef desyree. they have many glutenfree options as well. after trying bunch of samples and staring at the display for a good minute, i decided to go with fior di latte sweet cream and rice pudding gelato. fior di latte: it was like a sweetened milk, super creamy with subtle sweetness. i loved that even though it was milk flavored, it wasnt too rich or heavy like how i imagined it to be. its light and delicate flavor was perfect for me! 55rice pudding: this reminded me of pudding i used to eat growing up back in japan called pucchin pudding. creamy texture and nostalgia...55i know chef desyree gets very creative with her gelato. some of these gelato include pink lemonade, blueberry pancake, extra virgin olive oil, froot loops cereal, red and white organic miso with almond toffee, smurf, etc. conclusionbelieve the hype. check their instagram gelatologylv to see their flavor of the day!
welllllll, this is an awesome gelato spot in the southwest area. where else can you find something so perfectly priced and with huge portions?! the gelato seriously tastes truly authentic to flavor and i know the owner is a gelato expert so if youre in the area you should definitely try it out. the gelatos texture is so light and very tasty! not too sweet at all! the service is amazing and she always remembers me when i come in. definitely worth 5 stars.
i am so glad that chef desyree has been able to reopen and feed me gluttonous treats. my boyfriend and i have always been such suckers for her crazy creative flavors and her professionalism. we trust her with every flavor weve had and that includes the blue cheese. coming from someone that does not eat blue cheese, not even on salads, thats saying something!desyree is such a delight to work with and i enjoy seeing her whenever we go in. i know that she works hard and puts her all into her work. she knows how to mix the perfect combination of flavors to reach gelato nirvana. her baked desserts like her cookie butter salted biscuits and cookies are equally mouthwatering. if i had the metabolism of my other half, i would personally be buying her gelato by the tub which you can do.of all of the dessert choices in las vegas, gelatology with chef desyree is my favorite.
dear desyree: if you are reading this, it was such a pleasure meeting you yesterday!on to my short review:desyree warmly welcomed me into her shop and asked me if it was my first time there it was. she then explained to me her methods and her madness and let me try a scoop of every single one of her flavors that she had that day! i felt bad because i went through so many of her little plastic spoons...i literally could not decide what i wanted to have, but ultimately decided on peanut butter. very rich and flavorful. i was tempted to get another scoop of something else, but i really have to watch my figure! service is a big deal to me. so when the product is good and the service is excellent, i will be returning and often. next time im gonna try something more exotic that isnt found anywhere else.
i used to go to the downtown location all the time once i discovered this wonderful ladys talent. i am so excited she relocated closer to me! my belly and heart are so happy! today the provocative black fig and mascarpone got me curious and it was poetic. this has to be on your las vegas foodie bucket list if you havent tried it yet!
when i was in las vegas this past july, i checked in on my yelp phone app to the former location of this gelato shop which had its former name.  the kind las vegas yeeps were watching out for me and warned me that this was not what i had been looking for. i was wondering why i wasnt seeing unusual flavors such as captain crunch.in the past few months, i read about gelatology with anticipation. all of the reviews and check ins by vegas yeeps got me so excited that this was my first stop of my vegas vacation. the opportune time arrived today when i dropped off mom,auntie,  sister at the mall and i could sneak off and enjoy a treat! !!i arrived at close to opening time, so the shop was empty, clean, and bright!  i had the full attention of the chefs husband, luigi. he answered all of my questions and took me on a taste tour. some of the flavors were such a pleasant surprise and i wanted them all. he suggested that i narrow down to 3 so that my taste buds wouldnt be on overload. i got the pumpkin cheesecake for seasonal reasons, pear  gorgonzola cheese because luigi encouraged me to try it  and i like cheese  plus, the pear makes it taste better; and the mushroom,  onion  basil risotto  sounds weird but tastes great!i might have to return tomorrow since flavors change daily. maybe i will share this find with my family, but maybe not because they want to go shopping again tomorrow. ..hahaha!notes: clean and convenient restrooms are available.  free and plentiful parking is in the front.  gluten free options as well as lactose free made with coconut milk taste onolicious!
clearly think am the last yelper in vegas to review gelatology. really nothing much to add in this conversations but will try my yelp best. i had my cousins visiting from out of town. we started the night with some hh, then dinner, and for dessert telling them save room for gelatology. i have been meaning to check it out. so finding the place was little tricky more so since it was my first time. we actually had make uturn because depending on the direction coming from there this tree that blocks the sign on the outside of the building. really once pull in the little shopping mall not miss it because the logo is very distinct and stands out. so once we went in realize gelatology is so much more of a true reflection of desyree. it completely night and day comes to her old location. not that the old location lacked personality. all her followers know so no need to bring up the past but stick with the present. it slightly bigger then her old location so it has more seats, lot more room for her desserts, pastries, and interior decor is cool with the new brandinglogo. love the vibe of the place with the bright colors inside, family vibe, and great spot sit down chill relax talk stories with familyfriends.i know she expanded her menu adding more then just gelato. i will eventually get around to tasting. but for me her gelato is the only reason come and if going out of my way for gelato gelatology is worth it! now with social network. you can preview all her flavors everyday before you even go down. she has instagram account. she really does wonderful job of showing not only her gelato but her desserts. i had no idea the direction wanted to go with choice. you can try as much flavors as you want! always been person that thinks trying every single flavor makes no sense. i ended up going with coconutsea salt caramel. i think was awesome combination. the coconut tasted spot on like haupia from back home in hawaii. it had creamy coconut texture, but still strong flavor of coconut, and super refreshing. the sea salt cream was also spot on. the combination i was digging caramelcoconut like one of those candy bars. i am drawing blank on. my cousins got different flavors. the peanut butter was insane. it literally tasted like creamythick peanut butter out of jar. there few things that i feel make her spot stands out but love that she always looking to make new flavors! not just safe ones but willing to try at times out of bounds flavors for the rest of the world to try at the same time. she really is the most hands on small business owner i have come across in vegas. she truly cares about making each customer experience the best can be. she explains her style and if new she starts you off with base of all her gelato. it like go crazy with any combination or just want one flavor all up to you. it very reasonable price. unlike old place the parking and area need to stated again so much better. if that was your excuse well got no excuse now. if never had desyree gelato you need to get some.
8 min until close and the owner was impressive, not to mention the amazing flavors! legit.
i was reading about gelatology on yelp, and wanted to try their gelato about one month now. finally this afternoon i decided to find this store. it wasnt hard, since i already checked the map, and immediately realized, its conveniently located in the smiths shopping center, where i am shopping for groceries a lot!after walking to the shop, i recognized everything what i already knew from other yelp reviews.i really cant add more to my review than others already did!i been offered to try different flavored gelato! after tasting five, all good ones, i choose chocolate and coconut!  6oz for 5.50 it was delicious!i learned that the lady behind the counter is the owner. she was very polite and informative!she told me that the products are made without any chemicals or food dye! also some gelato made for lactose intolerant people!very impressed!cant wait to return with my friend, and try other items too!i already drove by this evening with my daughter, to show her this new place!
this place is fabulous. the owner is super nice and he is very aware that a lot of customers have dietary restrictions or allergies. it was the second question he asked us when we came in. he let us sample as many flavors as we wished and had such a variety of flavors. there are also a number of vegan and dairy free options.
the sweet potato, caramel  pecan was awesome! nothing beats great dessert after a long day and great service from the owner, luigi, himself!
i loved art of flavors when desyree was there, but thank god shes on her own now with gelatology. the best thing is that its less than 10 minutes from home now.  this place never fails to make my day! this is why i always take everyone here. desyree still makes the best gelato as sorbetto! i can literally go here everyday without getting tired of their gelato. my favorites so far include the sweet corn, cinnamon toast crunch, rose petals, rice pudding, ugh i cant possible list them all. the service is still 5 stars! i cant wait to see what else desyree has in stock for us.
absolutely amazing gelato and espresso! the owner was so kind and attentive, the gelato was better than some we had in italy, and the espresso was a delightful ending to the sweet treat. if youre in town visiting and can get over to gelatology, it is completely worth the trip.
wonderful spot! i was greeted quickly and was immediately served samples of their four most popular flavors. i ended up settling on the almond cookie. it was delicious, perfectly creamy and surprisingly filling for getting the smallest size. great customer service. all products in the store are made inhouse. check it out!
i came in really full already so i didnt try a lot of flavors. what i tried were good. glad its here next to tanning place. theres really no other ice cream or frozen yogurt in this neighborhood.
a must if you enjoy gelato, this place is hidden in a strip mall and you could easily miss it. service was exceptional , staff was more than will to let you try any flavor or all of them for that matter. i must have tried 7 favors during my visit with my family, gelatology features 18 flavors and some gluten and vegan free gelato selections.in addition to gelato they feature some assorted pastries and beverages.i will be back to try the rest of menu.
this place is incredible!!!! customer service was perfect and the gelato is out of this world. better than any of the gelato i tried in italy! love the sweet potato and the snicker doodle. but really you cant go wrong. we tried about 10 flavors and each one was good. the owner knows how to create flavors all were unique and delicious. she is a flavor genius! we felt very welcomed and cant wait to go back again. 10 stars!!
shes back!  drove 500 miles for her awesome gelato!  none like desyrees gelato!  come one come all yelpers. this is a must stop for vegas.
so i was on my way to serenade cafe and saw this new place gelatology opened 3mos ago so she said...even their bright orange sign look delicious! the gelato barista ? eagerly offered tasting and patiently explained everything from gelato to their baked goods ..all made in house and fresh. i like their well thought out variety ..they covered all bases from gluten free to lactose free ..i tried ube gelato and ube marshmallows ..love how flavorful they are...but got the orange marshmallows instead ..coz of its unique fresh citrusy profile. i love anything coconut so also bough the macarons ..they are soft and moist ! yumm!!! i tasted these gelatos ..gorgonzola pear, lychee, ube, salted caramel, gluten free apple pie creme brulee ..all great ..the cheese one not something ill die for but walked away with lychee gelato ..refreshing, just enough sweetness for a late night dessert ..so now im all done with my gelato and half the bag of macaroons and few pieces of marshmallows..i feel fulfilled but still craving coffee ..good thing i havent left the parking lot ...serenade here come !
this gelato place is really good. besides gelato, they also sell baked goods, which i didnt try. my main focus was to get my hands on the gelato. the shop is off the strip and in this little mall. you cant see it from s rainbow blvd. you have to drive in and its tucked in this little corner. the reason i came is because one of my yeep friends recommended it and told me that they had interesting flavors. interesting flavors indeed! white coffee beans, banana foster, cookie butter, white chocolate candy corn, and pear  gorgonzola to name a few. i settled for the white coffee beans and ube combo. it was creamy and smooth. i preferred the white coffee beans over the ube. the ube didnt have a very strong flavor. the hubby got a sorbetto combo. i not sure what flavors he chose but it wasnt bad. it wasnt too tart and wasnt too sweet, right in the middle.all the gelatos and sorbettos are made in house.
i love desyree and her ability to create the most delicious and bizarre flavors and somehow incorporate them in gelato. i love that she remembers all her customers and takes the time to talk to you and appreciates the business you bring. i am constantly raving about this little gem to all my friends and coworkers and they in turn are doing the same. you really cant get any better than this. i honestly hate that she has an instagram posting daily flavors because it forces me to get off my ass and drive all the way to her place. ive been here way too many times but i cant help it. the flavors are always intriguing and its always fun to stop by on the weekends to see what savory flavors she comes up with. my personal favorites are cookie butter, salted caramel, lychee, chocolate, pear and gorgonzola cheese... okay maybe all of them. and if im too lazy to scoop, i love getting the salted caramel shake. its so creamy... its seriously to die for.
heaven!  i usually drive down rainbow and saw the sign pop up.  i definitely have a sweet tooth so i had bookmark it.  over and over, i kept seeing the photos pop up on my facebook, so jesse n. and i finally made it to gelatology. it located in the smiths shopping center, tucked in the back end of the center.  plenty of parking.  we walked in, low and behold, lots of gelato, and may more baked goods to take home or gift.  fabulous service, served with smiles. we were greeted and asked if we have ever been here before....that was the greeting to, what flavor would you like to try?  they will graciously let you try every flavor they have.  aaaaaaaahh, that is great customer service.  i always get confused on what flavor to get when there is tons to try.  since i have been there more than 3x, my go to flavor has been the halo halo  pear gorgonzola.  the other day, jesse made a peanut butter, jelly, pickle,  coffee combo.  i couldnt stop laughing at how much he enjoyed it.  pickled coffee, who would have thought?with the ever changing menu of gelato, that means, every time you go there, you get a new flavor. mmmmm mmmmm, thank you gelatology for being so darn creative in flavors.  i am a fan indeed.
amazing service! unlimited samples! delicious flavors that change everyday! best gelato place in town!
always saw this place driving since i lived around the area. one day i just decided i wanted to give this place a try and it was quite good ! we were greeted right away and offered many different flavors to sample what we want. their flavors are also made fresh daily. the owner also gave us samples of their favored marshmallows.  will return again.
there are so many great flavors here, its hard to call them all out. but the spicy chocolate with peperoncino has been one of my favorites with its mild spiciness that lingers on the palate. you cant really go wrong with any of the flavors. im always on the lookout for the instagram posts to see what the latest daily specials will be. no other gelato shop in town comes up with their level of creative sweet or savory flavors. theres always something unique for those looking for different flavors. for the less adventurous, there are plenty of traditional flavors to be enjoyed.
every flavor ive sampled has been delicious. glad to have this place so close. they have savory flavors but i enjoy the more traditional flavors the best.
lots of great flavored house made gelato. unsure of a flavor to try?? just ask for a sample. everyone here is very friendly and well informed of their product, cannot ask for more since their gelato and hot cocoa are amazing!! after having a few samples though, i must be honest, i was still confused on which flavor to get.
the best in town! in the past 2 weeks ive gone 5 times because they keep bringing out new flavors everyday! its hard to catch up haha
i am definitely late to this gelato game but i am glad i checked it out after seeing some friends check in here.the first time i went sara ? im bad with names im sorry! was the one one that served me and my friend and they just happened to have their foie gras gelato. i love anything foie gras who doesnt and i havent had any for a while so i said to myself: why not?after that first sample bite i fell in love with the place. i love that they make their own gelato and sorbetto in house and i appreciate the flavor combinations they come up with pear and gorgonzola, rice pudding, ube, black sesame seed and avocado to name a few.her goodies counter always has something unexpected ube marhmallows, ube macaroons can you tell i love ube?, pandan marshmallows, etc. a couple more visits and i was finally able to meet the owner desyree. such a sweet and warm woman. very wonderful. very passionatr. always welcoming and ready to give you samples of her daily gelato and sorbetto. her food and customer service has won her a loyal guest to her establishment and has become my ritual go to places during my day off. heres well wishes to your future endeavors and heres to hoping you open one in hederson! haha
after not seeing the amazingly talented chef desyree since february, i finally made a trek to her new home far far away in the same strip mall where serenade is located.we were warmly greeted by desyree as soon as we walked in. we got to try almost all of her wonderful products: macarons, gelato, sorbetto, and marshmallows. she also has biscuits, chocolate barks, honeycomb, coconut macaroons, and drink concoctions.gelatosorbetto:some flavors change dailyalmost daily, and there are mainstays. flavors like avocado, olive oil, yuzu, nutella, fruit smoothie, pina colada, peach and gorgonzola, japanese green tea kit kat, gingerbread, bananas foster, fior di latte, cookies and cream, chocolate, peanut butter, etc. desyree makes her gelatosorbetto fresh everyday. she has sweet frozen treats and savory frozen sweets. get yours in a cup or cone. the cups come in 4 sizes. i like trying new flavors with my staple: nutella! 55marshmallows:these are not the commercialized white fluff in a plastic bag at the grocery store. these are semidense tiny blocks of good marshmallows that come in flavors like nutella, vanilla, peppermint, and orange. even filipino flavors like ube purple yam, and pandan. ive tried the different flavors and they were all very good but the one i brought home were the nutella marshmallows 55i also got nutella sea salt biscuits, nutella hazelnut truffles, and a nutella macaron. so, basically, anything with nutella that was available that day, i got and tried to eat all of them. yuuuuummmm!!!
my boyfriend and i visited this place down at the sw area. love the variety of ice cream flavors. i always tried their affogato and it was the bomb! last time i visited i had their affogato with caramel ice cream. i just love their mixture of their coffee and ice cream. my boyfriend had their hot cocoa and it was good too! the people working here were very welcoming! i will be visiting here again!
yes! shes back! desyree is here to stay, and she continues to weave her magic in awesome flavors and combinations. she harnesses her passion and takes the art of gelato to new flavorful stratospheres. her peaches  gorgonzola is a fave. try her smoked salmon  cream cheese gelato yes  you heard me right. who would have thought salmon and cheese could be a gelato. she is a modern day fairy whipping up so many magical treats  gelato or otherwise.
got the buttery chicken. could order the spice level from 110. make sure to get the mango lassi.
i am a regular customer and i do enjoy their food. my favorites would have to be the buttered chicken, buttered naan and the mango lassi. the owners are very sweet and exceptionally nice. their prices are inexpensive and reasonable. and as a student it is nice to sit down, study and eat their food.
as a regular, this place is amazing. the food is excellent as well as affordable, and the staff is very friendly. their samosas are literally addictive half of the engineering department has a serious dependency, and the butter chicken is delicious. try the mango lassi while youre there too. its soooooooo good.
i come here really often and i always get the same thing. i love their butter chicken and naan! their prices are so affordable and the staff is always so friendly.
this place is really cool! i love there butter chicken and the environment it has! the people who work there are so nice! definitely coming back and bringing my friends along.
i love this place . i come here everyday for the butter chicken and naan . mango lassi is bomb as well !
had the chicken tiki masala  the butter chicken and they were both delicious. their prices are very reasonable and the food was good. loved the garlic non as well. would definitely recommend coming here to eat.
indian bowl cuisine is a wonderful, authentic surprise in the stressful area of the las vegas airport. we got lots of really good food for a great price, and they gave all 8 of us free sample mango lassis. the service was exceptional and the taste amazing. simple, quality, and a great find. 1010 would recommend.
its a real good indian food that ive had since ive moved to las vegas. its the only place i go to because the food is good.  the price is average and its good enough compare to the other indian food that ive had before.
the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan is my favorite. they have a good variety of dishes and affordable prices. i usually get a 2 dish combo that also includes rice for 5.99. i love that they are located across unlv :
the people are nice, the food is delicious and i was feasting for 2 people that cost less than 20! i had the butter chicken with rice, naan and mango lassi! hit the spot!
omg. the food was so good it literally made my eyes roll back to the back of my head! im so happy to have discovered this hidden gem. the food is flavorful, serving sizes are more than decent, and their prices are way better than other indian restaurants around town! definitely would recommend the butter chicken, naan, and mango laasi. soooo goood!!!
absolutely worth a try! the prices are amazing and flavor is not spared. first time there today and i will defo be going back! delicious!  had the butter chicken. . chicken tikka masala.  veggie samosa and garlic naan and all was superb
came here for the first time tonight with my fiance after searching yelp for indian food. very clean restaurant and the food was amazing!! we had the lamb curry, butter chicken and garlic nann. my fiance and i have definite taste buds he likes spicy and i do not. luckily they allowed him to have extra spicy sauce on the side. we will absolutely be coming back here again. fresh, clean and friendly. what more could u ask for!
her skills are out of this world!!!! she cleans everything. she cleans my house weekly and im never disappointed! thanks sandi
my apt looks so nice, organized and smell so fresh and clean, it looks like a brand new place and i love it. sandi is amazing and takes a lot of pride in her work. i really enjoyed her today and all the extra special things she do like making me popcorn while i enjoyed my favorite show, i was pleasantly surprise to get a bag of popcorn like u get in the movies filled with hot tasty kettle corn... she even offered to cook us dinner but i had plans but definantly next time.
i really needed help cleaning my house after a party i hosted at my house, sandi did an amazing job! i was very pleased and would definitely use her again! she was detailed in her work, she made sure i approved of her cleaning prior to leaving thank you sandi!
sandis house cleaning has been amazing. she really seems to care about her work. this can be noticed with the little details she leaves behind: thank you cards, candies, paper flare and sometimes even a drawn bathe. she has many little tricks up her sleeve to clean harder than normal gunk. very professional with uniforms, webpage and you can pay through the square. pretty impressive for a beginner!
she is wonderful! she did not miss one spot in the areas that she cleaned! not only does my house look great but she is an all around wonderful person! i called her in the morning and she was there the same day,on a saturday at that!! she went above and beyond. my dishes were clean and my cabinet was organized! i would not hesitate to recommend her at all!! great job!!
they responded quickly and did a great job. would recommend to a friend.
alex was very kind and professional. it was a quick job, got the parts in earlier than anticipated and he came and installed them right away at a very fair price. i would recommend him.
went here today with my daughter and wow!! their smoothie are larger than most places and the flavor for all 4 of our smoothies were very pleasing to the palette. . being a former chef and tasted volcano tea or now cafe. .also kung fu tea house and this place has them beat with flavor.  their boba cooked perfect and definitely will come back!! they also serve food . cant wait to try it..very nice setting too. possible fathers day dining this weekend...
went here with my sister for dinner! we got the matcha green tea smoothie, and passion fruit tea with boba, both which tasted great. to eat, we got crab rangoons and sesame chicken. flavor is awesome and cooked well. also, the service is so nice! overall, a great place for smoothies and food :
great customer service, owner gary is so nice! he brought us free drinks!
i must say this is the best place to stop by and get some chinese food. the whole staff is nice and they provide excellent customer service and i find myself there pretty much every single day and thats how you know i just can get enough lol. there drinks and smoothies are really good oh and did i mention there food is really good as well . everything there is so good to the point where my coworkers see my food and drink,they send back over there to get them ether a smoothie or food. thank you guys for the excellent service you guys are the best! gabe, xavier and caylon ^_^
super nice place. tons of room for groups. gary was friendly and super helpful. the honeydew boba smoothie was delish. the combination fried rice was perfect, not super greasy. my boyfriend and i fought over the last bite. will recommend and be back.
its nice to have an authentic chinese restaurant that serves boba tea and delivers too! when the temperatures are sky rocketing above 100, let them deliver to you in the comfort of your own home. the size of my boba drink was one of the biggest ive seen in vegas. they dont skimp and all the fruit smoothies are made w real fruit! they serve a variety of chinese dishes too. the only bad thing is that they are pretty hidden in the corner of the smiths shopping center. dont let that discourage you to try it out. its truly a hidden gem!
yum!!! finally a place that has authentic fresh dumplings..handmade every morning! now, if you know me you know im a dumpling whore and always on the hunt for a new chinese restaurant. this place is spot on!
finally some decent broccoli and beef !! nom nom nom. i thought the general saus was good but my bf would have preferred it spicier probably his mistake for not ordering it that way. best egg drop soup ive ever had. pan fried noodle with bbq chicken and sesame chicken was good! got two smoothies cucumber and mango that were refreshing and delicious. gave us plenty of rice and it was also tasty. only complaints are that the egg drop soup had completely spilled into the bag from the container so they might want to rethink their containers and that they were stingy on the sweet and sour sauce that came with their yummy egg rolls.
the staff is amazing. they are super friendly. the food is delicious, made fresh, and the portions are larger than you expect. i highly recommend this place. try one of their 99 flavors of boba fruit smoothies, you will love those. stop reading this review and go there and eat.
absolutely delicious! the chinese cuisine here is incredibly authentic and at amazing prices. the best part about this restaurant though is the super nicehelpful staff. i highly recommend the steamed or broth shrimp dumplings, they are so tender and juicy. another fave is the seafood hong kong noodles and seared scallops. oh yeah, they also make fresh smoothies with or without boba!overall a great little hole in the wall.
really good authentic chinese food, the dumpling is good, and their fruit smoothies are awesome! oh and the stuff are really friendly and very welcoming.. well come back!
best dumplings. the basa fish dumplings are amazing. watch out for the juice. sprayed me good. got the fried noodles with beef. lots of bran sprouts for a good texture balance. great food. nice people. good place to eat
great place to take the family 3 kids 2 toddlers and 2 adults. not crowded and not cramped, nice big and clean. the food was better than average for a chinese place. but the honey walnut shrimp could use more sauce so order extra. the dumplings were awesome, hand made from scratch which u can taste. the duck was juicy but not too fatty, the flavor was perfect not too salty. ordered the singapore rice noodles, be careful its got a kick which i didnt expect but i like spicy but some might get surprised by it. we also got some of their smoothies with boba. 1 free small smoothie with a check in on yelp! we ordered coconutlychee: a little on the sweet side with coconut jelly along with boba. the coffeevanilla was delish, perfect dessert drink. the taro smoothie had good flavor if u dont mind a slight grainy texture of taro. all in all bill came out to 60 with tax  tip. not bad for the amount of variety and food we got. try them out! and get your free choice of 50 flavors smoothie!
the restaurant really recommended the dumplings...  and for good reason!  tremendous.  had the cabbage and pork dumplings,  and they were spectacular.  had the lunch special which was very filling and had appetizers with it.  the sesame chicken was some of the best ive had in a long while.  cant speak highly enough of the amazing service.  primo!  definitely worth coming for.
were here in las vegas for the wfg convention and were looking for a great chinese food place that delivered to the hotels on the strip. boy did we luck up on this place! gary was amazing, from order to delivery he took great care of us. not only did he drive farther than usual to bring us our food but he even threw in a special treat. to eat, we had the veggie fried rice, mongolian beef and honey walnut shrimp. all taste fresh and delicious! thanks for a great experience. next time were in vegas well be sure to dine again.
great food and amazing service! gary definitely went above  beyond for us! thanks gary im stuffed!
love the casual environment with neighborhood service. so awesome they deliver too. so much selection for here for clean healthy chinese food
outstanding food and service! best dumplings in town. housemade dough and fillings! i loved everything else we ordered too  roast duck, ma po tofu, yang zhou fried rice, and beef chow fun. as if that wasnt enough, you get a free smoothie with yelp check in, huge selection i had black sesame, delicious!. thank you gary! i will be back and i will tell everyone i know to come see you!
its my friend, celebration to be honest, they offered us free lunch cause its complimentary the waiter said, but we gave tips as how much we ate i like fried rice, and the tofu. a yummy delicious taste i will definitely come back again for another lunch.
my goodness. its been years since i had fantastic chinese cuisine. im so glad i stopped at cheerful because this place makes amazing food for very reasonable prices. the place is clean and roomy. the menu is the coolest  a heavy wooden cover! theres a wide range of apps, dishes, and smoothies to choose from. we went for 3 types of dumplings  fish, shrimp, and squash off menu item. i also grabbed my usual  honey walnut shrimp and sweet and sour pork. the dumplings are perfect. the wrap is tender and the fillings are flavorful. i loved the ginger vinegar dip with everything. the squash dumplings have serious juice, almost close to a soup dumpling filling. its light and oniony. the pork is very lightly coated and crispy. their sweet and sour sauce is not too thick, making for a pleasant eating experience. the walnut shrimp is super crispy and the sauce is tangy and not overly sweet.with my coconut taro boba to wash it all down, the meal was perfect. im definitely a fan of this place and will bring everyone here when we have a craving for chinese food.
the dining area at cheerful house is spacious and clean. i greatly appreciate how clean the tables are. pictures of the food decorate the walls. that is cool, sometimes you just want to see the food before you order it and the food here comes out looking as it does in the pictures. dumplings, dumplings, and more dumplings. fish, shrimp, pork and cabbage, and the occasional special dumplings. you can have them pan fried, steamed, or in soup. they all taste great and come to you hot. i am a big fan of the sweet  sour pork here. the pork was very tender and well seasoned with a nice crisp exterior. not a piece of gristle in the batch. the sauce was elegant with an excellent balance between the sweet and sour. nothing overly sweet like the neon red sauce found in many other establishments. i am going to have to try the other protein options with this sauce. honey walnut shrimp. i remember seeing this item pop up on a chinese menu for the first time. it was a curious combination of ingredients but it worked and i have liked it ever since. cheerful house does this dish right.the customer service is as excellent as the food. friendly and informative, our interaction with our server was very enjoyable. cheerful house reminds me of my favorite chinese restaurant when i was a child. as time went by and management changed, so did the flavors. one bite of the sweet  sour pork at cheerful house instantly brought me back to those memories of that first chinese restaurant. i have found my favorite chinese restaurant at cheerful house and i can not wait to explore the rest of the menu.
by far, the best dumpling in town.  enjoyed all dishes that we had and the service?  very gracious!  highly recommend to visit and try the dumplings.
great customer service  great food  great smoothies  great experience!!! will def be back!
phenomenal delicious food, world class service, gary is definitely a gogiver, and if you dont know the meaning, look up the book! thoroughly enjoyed our meal, they stayed open later just for us, and still provided fresh hot food. cant think of a better chinese restaurant in town!
we have a new favorite chinese delivery place.  the food is better than our usual spots and the price is right.  even the beef they use is really good.  which is hard to say about the other places in the area.
after a long day exploring the strip, and craving chinese food,  i found this place on yelp! i saw they had excellent reviews and was very close to our location.  after finding it hidden in the parking lot,  we walked in and were surprised by how clean the restraunt was. we were immediately greeting and welcomed inside,  once we sat down i redeemed my free smoothie,  and it was so amazing i bought 2 more for the rest of the family.  me and my wife decided on fried rice,  i got shrimp and she chose vegetable...  they were so considerate and prepared her food to her specifications perfectly.  hands down the best chinese food i have had in years.
we travel a lot and often rely on yelp to find places to eat. we came across cheerful house and thought the reviews sounded good. we got here and were immediately seated. the staff was super kind and courteous. the dining room was spotless. my husband ordered shrimp fried rice and i ordered vegetable fried rice. i dont eat eggs, so they made sure to leave them out for me. the kids got sweet and sour chicken and rice. theyre also picky, so they asked for sauce on the side, and the staff was kind enough to do that as well, with no issue. we ordered a few of the smoothies, which were fantastic. they met yet another request and used soy milk for mine. throughout the entire time we were there, we were checked on numerous times and the waiter was super friendly, even to the kids. we felt as if the entire staff really cared about their business and their customers. were sad that we live hundreds of miles away, because if we were local this would be our new favorite spot.
the best service i have ever had at a chinese restaurant. classes were always full, empty plates were always taken, and the owner and you even came out to talk to us making sure we were satisfied. highly recommended.
if there is one place you go for chinese food, let this be the place! it was so delicious! first you should know that google maps has the pin wrong...its actually tucked away on the back corner decatur side of smiths. anyhow...restaurant was clean, service was great, food was amazing. we started with the bbq pork. i asked for a side of hot mustard but in all actuality it wasnt even necessary. we shared kung pao chicken and orange beef. the kung pao chicken had all fresh veggies which is a big deal to me. the beef dish was perfect! not a lot of breading and just enough spicy. as a treat we also ordered a smoothie...mango passion fruit i believe? it was a perfect dessert which we enjoyed throughout the meal. today i have told at least 5 friends about this place today and i will tell more. i cant wait to return! high fives and two thumbs up for cheerful house.
this review is solely for their dumplings, and i am obsessed with them. their pork dumplings are my favorite, and i usually get them pan fried. very tasty and juicy almost reminds me the little soup dumplings aka xiao long bao. they make their dumplings freshly by hand, and although they only have three options, you can ask them if they could provide something else for you. i havent done this personally just because i already know i want their pork dumplings. i do order something else to try alongside my dumplings just so im not too biased. i have tried three of their fruit smoothies, and you can tell that they actually are drinks made from actual fruit. none of that powder stuff. staff members are attentive and give amazing service..which is rare at a chinese restaurant. the boss already recognized me my second visit, so their dumplings  the recognition makes me keep coming here.
we ordered delivery to our hotel room in the strip. the food was great and our delivery guy was super nice and apologetic for the long wait4560minutes. i definitely recommend the sesame chicken and the mongolian beef. the pork and cabbage dumplings were okay. the food was great but overall, the service is what really boosted my review to five stars.
this place takes me back to my awesome uni years in tennessee. the general tsos chicken and crab ragoons are dishes that i dont usually find in chinese restaurants in l.a. so, it was fun when i saw the dishes on the menu. the place is clean and comfy. service was fast and polite. 1010.food is sooo good, especially the general tsos chicken. not too sweet nor too spicy. a bit crunchy since it has the perfect amount of sauce. pure deliciousness!! portion is large. decent prices.
please com here..make it your go to for chinese food..wow!  you come in and its gorgeous impecable decoration almost contemporary..beautiful   the service is friendly and personable..and they speak english perfectly.  the food is impecably delicious. the restaurant is clean. theres free wifi...a must try.  the owner is a sweetheart. he told me they use only fresh ingredients..and it shows!  i would give them a 20 not a 10 for sure!  tried like 5 restaurants in chinatown...and their greasy..inconsistant and some rude if youre not asian???  plus most dont speak english well. they just care to sell..they push stuff on you for the money only..they dont care about notbing else?
i highly recommend this chinese restaurant.  it is clean and the ingredients especially the vegetables are fresh.  the place is quiet and they serve beer and sake.  5 stars!  the fruit smoothie is excellent too!
the first chinese restaurant that ive been to in vegas that i want to return to.i had to decide between cheerful house and another chinese restaurant that i want to try. i decided on cheerful house as i really wanted to try two things that id read about: the dumplings and the general tsos chicken my old standby, and something that i still like on occasion. oh, and the smoothies...i went on a tuesday  it was slow, but thats tuesday the dumplings 55: my only wish was that i did not get them in soup. not that the soup was bad  it was a nice chicken stock that was tasty yet not strongly flavored, which is as it should be or else the soup would have diminished the flavor of the dumplings. my problem was not with the soup itself but with me, as my inept handling of the dumplings with chopsticks made for a dumpling highdive back into my soup bowl and a messy table! i should have followed my waiters advice and gotten them panfried, i think! also, the soup makes them slipperier if anything. it got easier after i just started forking them, though...the dumplings were served with three sauces: a dark sauce soy vinegar?, a red vinegar  ginger sauce and a chili oil sauce. i was surprised that the red vinegar sauce was so good  it was my unexpected favorite.the general tsos 45: ive been to only a few chinese places since my move to las vegas, and this was the first one that did it well. even after sitting at the table for awhile as it took the backseat to the dumplings, it still had some crispiness to it, and was not overly sweet though if you like it pretty spicy it may need to be requested as such. the smoothie 55: i saw 1 chinese restaurant that tried to do this before i moved  this was more the purview of coffee shops in my exarea. well, i like it here! my pineapple mango smoothie was very tasty: it tasted like fruit, because thats what they use at cheerful house, and was a great substitute for an overly sweet dessert.this is a very great place for the   i will be back!
ordered chow mein and mongolian beef , both were excellent , fast service and the good came in so quick
we tried this place because of good reviews. they seem new? since when we went there, it was pretty empty. i have to say, the food is delicious. the dumplings are pretty well made. the roasted duck was crispy and flavorful. they use fresh fruits on their boba. were definitely coming back.
fantastic food. great dumplings, duck, smoothies, and salt and pepper pork chop. couldnt get enough of the pork chops! will definitely return!
mongolian beef and cashew chicken was delicious! strawberry watermelon smoothie was also yummy! definitely will be coming back!
today was my first time in, but now i think i can fairly say that this place is my favorite chinese restaurant in vegas. we had the roasted duck and it was cooked perfectly. still juicy, but tender and flavorful. also not overly seasoned. and for 12 it was a lot of food. we split it and still had half the dish to take home.also our server gary was the best. he was so friendly and professional. he poured the tea for us and anticipated our needs.
this time i ordered beef chow fun..which not alot of chinese restaurants have. and it was to die for delicious. didnt even have to add salt. very on point..i ordered it take out..now i can divide it into 3 meals..yummm!  great sevice and very clean....try this place..its sooooooo worth it!  oh love their sauces..the chinese mustard is to die for..you just want to drink it.. i sware!
called in to place and order for delivery. i was amazed at how nice and helpful the man on the phone was. he spoke english perfectly and helped me with my dietary restrictions. no meat, only fish. usually its hard to find things without chicken or beef stock hidden in dishes, theres a language barrier, or else servers dont know the ingredients of the dishes. but this man was perfect! he made a corn soup for me and helped me order the hong kong style noodles i wanted. right before hanging up he convinced me to order the dumplings and explained that was their specialty. great up sell i felt confident he was going to make my dumplings without meat. the man on the phone was also the delivery driver. the food came in less then 35 mins and the dumplings were the best! some kind of seafood and were perfectly crispy on the outside and when you took a bite the juices exploded. my favorite. the hong style noodles are what most places call pan fried noodles with the gravy on top. i wish the noodles were fried a little less but im being picky. the chinese broccoli in the noodle sauce was cooked perfectly with still some crunch. none of the food was overly greasy or make me heavy or sick like other chinese food. i will be coming here again!
food was very good. the beef brocolli was very savory. tried a fruit smoothie and it was very good. you could taste the fresh fruit.
im a first timer and this place is great!!!! delivery was on point. delivery person was very respectful. oh yeah food was awesome!!!!
very friendly staff.  tried the pan fried fish dumplings.  they were good.  i would have liked some sauce with a little more zip.  will definitely try again to sample other items.
great little spot for essential chines food. ordered the roast duck and a few appetizers and everything was done extremely well for the prices. the duck was crispy and juicy and the service was friendly and helpful. the dumplings were made fresh and i recommend the pork and cabbage. i will be coming back soon!
new kid in town and worth it! pick your favorite or go for the family meal. we picked family meal a and loved it! hot and sour soup was perfect! just the right amount of hot and sour. also picked the beef and broccoli, chicken fried rice and general chow chicken. all great flavors and bathed in rich sauces. one tiny issue, general chick was a little too fried, but we didnt mind too much. they also have 40 smoothies. yum!!!! and last but not least the price is right with entrees at 12 ish!
very good food, reasonably priced with large portions.  clean and quiet.  their dumplings and egg rolls were very good.
i thought i cant find chinese food in vegas but iwas wrong！this restaurant is cleanwaiter is nice and food is delicious
went here tonight for dinner with my fiance. the food was excellent i got the pan fried noodles with shrimp and he got the chicken chop suey and the staff was awesome. our server was constantly refilling our water and asking us if we were satisfied. he even let us hang out after we finished eating and still refilled our water. great service, and i look forward to going back again!
fantastic!!!! great service, very friendly ! the food  was fresh and tasty. go and show them some love !
i come to vegas once or twice a year and although food option change often, i get tired of eating on the strip.  tonight im so glad we ordered in! 1 they delivered to hotel, 2 fast delivery 3 great service, 4 great price  5 excellent food!  i chose cheerful house because of the seaweed, tofu chowder. not really a chowder more like a very hearty miso with yummy broth, seaweed that was tasty and firm and a lot of it. so good and super filling. loved the flavor! it has a mild flavor for the americanized pallet so it shouldnt scare you off with seaweed and tofu in the name.  easily spiced up also!  completely delicious and completely gone! also had the chinese broccoli in oyster sauce. fresh! prepared perfectly.  the portions are big so i didnt try the mapo tofu that we ordered also, but its on the menu for breakfast. thanks yelpers for helping me find this place. i hope it does well because i only get to vegas once or twice a year and this is a must stop for all future trips!morning after! the mapo  tofu is so good. i usually dont go with mapo because the tofu is soft but if was so good. love the mapo sauce.
we just had lunch here.  we ate at some very pricey restaurants while in lv, and had our best meal here.    the food here is good and a good value.  i had the kung pao chicken lunch special.  for 7.95 you get an entree,  flavorful egg drop soup, a cream cheese rangoon, and eggroll. my companion had orange beef which he enjoyed. the rice was cooked properly, not mushy. we had the homemade pork dumplings. they were tasty and well seasoned. the staff was friendly.
great take out . quick and i would absolutely recommend to my friends in the future .
their food is so delicious and the customer service is attentive and relaxing! try their boba, too! yumyumyummas and it is fresh. not that powder stuff you usually get from boba places. i will definitely be returning. also, they deliver. gah, how awesome. hope this place stays open and never leaves.
i yelped many placesand this place popped up so i decide to give this place a chance and im glad i did. i bought my kids phone cases. kids dont take care of much but the owner gave me good prices so i cant complain. the owner was polite.
if you want your phone fixed fast? come here edwin fixed my cracked screen in 15 mins. great customer service with people you can trust!
this is a family run business! i stopped by here on my lunch break, wonderful and very fast customer service. prices upfront and knowledgeable business owners. raja and halima work well and fast together and made me very happy. i am so thankful for their help. this is not their only location, they have one at 5241 w. charleston too. go here instead of the apple store, they do free diagnostics and give you the prices for all options right up front! apple store charges for diagnostics, makes you wait even if you have an appointment  apple store isnt worth it.
the most affordable coworking space in town. awesome coffee and staff. sometimes offer fresh pastries
first impression.  first experience.  i think we finally have a great nail salon up in north scottsdale.  next to the lone mountain ajs...  clean, friendly  a great pedicure to top it off!  just opened!  maya, owner, made everyone feel welcome!  welcome to the neighborhood!
lovely atmosphere. great service. didnt try to oversell me. very friendly employees.
i have been there twice with my daughter. we both loved our nails! they do an excellent job and are very friendly and professional. highly recommend!
this spa has new ownership and wow what an amazing experience! this is my second time at happy nails and im pleased to report that both times the experience has been top notch! this time ann a fabulous  super friendly technician did my pedicure. she was fantastic! from the moment i walked into the spa its obvious the staff is truly dedicated to making the customer feel pampered. they make an extra effort to make you feel welcome and do a lot of little things to make the experience extra special. for example, i had a pedicure, but they also massaged my hands and massage my neck and back afterwards. they also spend quite a bit of time massaging your legs. in fact it seems like it was longer than the average spa does. for 50 it felt like i spent the day at a fancy spa. what a value and what great people!!! this is no longer at the nail salon that it used to be. if you havent given it a try go back! its well worth it!!!!
love this salon.  they give great manis and pedis with wonderful massages even while your mani is drying, bonus!.  they are fantastic and this is now my goto nail salon after another favorite for over 10 years.  thanks, anne! :
great service and prices. got a manipedi for what it usually costs for pedicure in cave creek carefree. and a shoulder rub! very nice people and clean establishment. after 3 years of looking in the area, i have a new regular place to go!!
new ownership has really whipped things into shape!  amazing service, friendly nail artists and the massages are fabulous!!! ive gotten the premium pedicure, which is worth every dollarand the gel mani.
im not kidding when i say that was the best experience ive ever had at a nail salon! my technician was male and im kicking myself for not remembering his name. he was amazing. so particular and almost a perfectionist  which i appreciate when it comes to nails or hair.the entire staff was welcoming and friendly! they didnt try to upsell or push me to get anything other than what i asked for. i am so excited to go back.also!! they take card but you cant tip on your card so make sure you have cash. trust me, with service like this youll want to tip!
first to review, bitches!i dont always shop at a store thats full of things to keep other things in, but when i do, i shop online at containerstore.com and then i pick it up here. already pulled together by the store staff and bagged up for me.
i really like this store. very upbeat and a lot of positive energy. they are very welcoming and even cheer you on if you sign up for a rewards card. creepy but fun.  : they have some nice products which are very reasonably priced. if your an organization freak like me you will like it here!

a store just got containers, perfect for those type a personalities!i love the acrylic shoe boxes for my closet and they even have some for my purses. this place really had so much and i think im in love. my mother, who is a total type a personality frequents this store often. unlike me, where i just come in for what i need or the basicsthis place has put organization on a whole new level. i recommend checking if out and i will have to post some photos of my shoe and purse boxes shortly.
i saw a sign out on southern by la fitness for tc street tacos. now im a fan of the real deal little tacos, and i happened to not have had lunch yet, so i decided to make a stop in.the place just opened up last wednesday. the decor is simple. they basically took over the chinese place that was there, added some mexican flair, and called it good. fine by me.i got the 3 taco dinner plate. they have at least a dozen taco options. the nice girl working behind the counter recommended the marinated chicken. i went ahead and got one of those, a carne asada taco, and a pork taco cant remember which one. it came with rice and beans, a couple roasted peppers which were nice and spicy, shredded cabbage, and sliced radishes.all three tacos were great. i added a little guacamole and homemade salsa from the salsa bar.ill definitely be back again. im so glad a good taco shop opened up in the neighborhood.
byob!! okay let me put it down plain and simple yelpers! flame broiled and smoke meats makes this place authentic street style tacos like you would taste in los angeles. yeah the beans and rice are 50 but please understand that beans and rice are nothing more than fillers in mexican food. this place is all about tacos but it serves a wonderful full flare of dinner plates like chili rellenos,pollo adobado,fajitas,mojarra frits! this place has the pork,chicken  beef grilled marinated and pulled and it tries to cover all bases and does a good job! eddie the cook was friendly and funny and hopes the neighbors dont complain because he smokes the meat out back. byob! thats  right you can bring your own beer and if you forget you have valley fair liquors nextdoor!
me and my husband decided to stop in this place for lunch and i am so glad we did cause the carne asada quesadilla was delicious, you can tell they use quality meat. my husband loved their smoky salsas. the staff was super friendly and engaged while we were sampling salsas. definately check this place out.
super friendly service! very family friendly and polite. my boyfriend and i love the carne asada tacos  if you want great mexican food this is the place to be! we will definitely be back!
saw this place just driving by and decided to try it out. best decision i could have made. amazing food and not only did the servers take excellent care of us, but the cook himself came out and talked to us to. great food and amazing staff. ill be back for sure
brand new place. just walked in and enjoyed the service and food. pulled pork was very food with rice and beans. i suggest giving your taste buds a taste test here. worth the stop.
if youre looking for authentic mexican food, look no further.staff is extremely friendly! havent felt this welcomed in a restaurant in a long time.carne asada plate was delicious. comes with mini tortillas which you can make some awesome tacos. completely full and satisfied.relatively new place, definitely will be back.edit: our cars battery died, and the cook was so gracious enough to drive us to oreillys to get a new battery. what a guy! kudos to their kindness and generosity.
had the steak, chicken and barbacoa tacos.delicious and fresh. not heavy and greasy. i could have had another 12 tacos.would come back again.
this place has the legit true mexico tacos. the spa ish rice is killer, the best around anywhere in tempe! try the chili rellenos..2 huge chilies stuffed with cheese and fried just right, ri e and beans included. order extra red sauce to make it complete. i like the salsa bar as well. hard to see from the street. just look behind pet club next to the drive in liquor store.
i was recommended by a friend when i walked in i was greeted by the whole staff felt like i knew each and every one of them i felt welcome and right at home then i was looking at the menu noticed they smoke and grill their items that is unique flavor of the smoke was incredible the meal i would pay twice for it when the chef  butcher came out to greet me making sure i was find with the meal and service was very cool i would recommend this place but  you need to try for yourself.

this place was so so good! i had the taco dinner which was 3 tacos with rice and beans. we needed a place like this in tempe. mexican food has been so disappointed but tcs delivered! cant wait to come back.
this place is amazing. hands down. one of the best places to get street style tacos and the salsa bar is so diverse that its almost hard to pick one. but the number one thing that sticks out the most about tcs is the hospitality. down to the people working the counter, to the chef who will always find a moment to come around to the front to ask you how the dishes are tasting. its a place to get amazing food, but most importantly amazing service and hospitality. thank you tcs for being true. dont change babe.
the marinated chicken here has got to be one of the best things ive ever tasted  not even exaggerating. the horchata was delicious and they had amazing service to go along with it. the guys working were so friendly and helpful. i will definitely be back, maybe weekly. already looking forward to my next trip!
had a three taco plate, carnitas, adobado chicken, and carne asada. also got the homemade chips and guac. everything was so fresh and delicious and the owner was super friendly and clearly passionate about his food. i would say the adobado chicken was the best taco, theyre the only taco shop in the valley that smokes their chicken and pork. really gives a nice smokiness to the meat. great salsa too. definitely will be heading back here.
great beef and smoked chicken tacos.  original order did not come out correctly but they quickly fixed it.
the food is amazing and fresh!!  i had the smoked chicken street tacos!  if they offer the smoked dry ribs not on the menu try them!!  amazing!!
i think i just found my favorite taco shop. lemme tell you guys. ive been waiting for a place like this. everything made from scratch. theyre tacos are amazing. best part of this place, home made salsa. holy cow their salsa is amazing! btw you can byob! i recommend this place! two thumbs way way up! and the guys who work there are the best! its like being in somebodys home and them cooking their food with some kind of secret ingredients that was passed down from generation to generation. this is true mexican food!
finally good mexican food intempe! the best meats ive had since i left texas. they smoke all their own meats, it was amazing. we will defiantly be back often! marinated chicken tacos and carnitas were divine  very attentive owners as well and wait for it.... its byob and right next to a liquor store.
awesome place!!! service was spectacular, food was authentic and delectable. went in for my first time ever on my birthday today, they brought me and my friend free desert! definitely will be back!
fun ambience, really nice server. tc smokes all their meats on site and it shows in the food. the al pastor tacos were very legit and flavorful. you get a lot of food for under 10. a nice quiet location that is perfect for a slowpaced lunch. not far from asu at all.
food is very good here.  you can really tell that they have people who know meat as the smoked pork and chicken are very good.  nice little find near home and near the la fitness.
fantastic personal service and the meats are topnotch. try the mexican dry ribs  never tried anything like it and they were cooked to perfection. ill be back again soon!
picked up dinner to go and was blown away by the shredded marinated chicken burrito. this shop just opened up so it is still in its beginning stages, but they are doing the most important thing right which is the quality of the food. the couple that owns the restaurant recently moved here from canada. they are very friendly, helpful and know what theyre dong. this place wont stay secret for long! if you are looking for delicious, top notch mexican food with a hint of spice and canadian charm that wont break the bank, this is the place to be!
i really hope this place stays around for a long time.i was hungry for dinner and i clicked on my yelp app and this place had great reviews and had what i wanted, which at the moment was tacos!the really unique thing about this place is that all the meats are cooked in a smoker which adds an added layer of flavor to your typical taco meat. i asked for the 3 taco special which included rice and beans.  i had smoked chicken, smoked pork and smoked beef.  they were all pretty good!the salsa bar is one of things you need to try. the salsa that stands out is an orange colored salsa that has some bite, and tastes like nothing ive had before.its good, you need to get some. . the other salsas were also very good and ill have to go back and try some different ones. they have a good selection of meat, pretty much anything you want and many items on the menu that i have yet to check out, overall this is a great spot with people that care about the food they make. ill be back for more
popped in after getting stuck in rush hour traffic.  turned out to be fantastic.  had the chicken fajitas, and would recommend them.  seems like a lot of pride in the food they are serving.  will be back to try some of the other things on the menu.
tc tacos has an incredibly friendly staff who is genuinely concerned about the quality of your experience and food. normally, itd be awkward when they ask you about the food, i often end up just nodding, but tc tacos has an incredible selection of fresh smoked meats. no awkward deception necessary, the food is great. the smoked meats make this place stand above other taco joints, and the staff just add to the foodie experience.
amazing tacos, and friendly staff.  i truly love this place because its right down the street and its great for a postworkout meal after im done at the l.a. fitness across the plaza. cant wait to come back for more!
husband and i were in tempe and hungry. yelped and this little gem popped up. i had the chile relleno burrito. omg! the cheese was melted and running all over the plate, and flavorful!  i know my chile rellenos and this was a good one, slightly charred the way i like it. the husband had the 3 taco plate, chicken adobo, chorizo  barbecued chicken. he said they were all good. i tasted only the barbecued chicken taco and had to agree with him.   their salsa bar is awesome, and they keep it on ice so it stays really fresh. i also had a sampling of their smoked chicken and it was really good tasting. apparently they make smoked chicken tacos.  will definitely go back when next im in town.
customer service is great! was really concerned about making sure i had everything i need and was satisfied with my meal. ill be back!
super casual chill place and the food is awesome! all the workers and owner are super personable and friendly. also, you can stop next door and grab some beer before you sit down and eat! definitely will be back!!
this place is awesome!! better than any mexican food place in tempe!! go here and get the burrito dinner
i came here with some friends on a whim  was pleasantly surprised! the menu is small but everything is made from scratch. i got the huevos rancheros, my husband got the breakfast burrito,  my friend got the veggie burrito. all items were delicious  the owner made sure to stop by  tell us about all of the salsa ingredients  meats that they smoke in house. this place is also byob friendly which is a huge plus since its right next to the liquor store! the horchata was refreshing  not too sweet  the guacamole was extremely fresh. the couple who runs this place is thorough  truly cares about the quality of their food. i have no complaints  will definitely be back!
this taco place has the best food ever. no gristle in the meat like usual. super fresh and really lean i love the barbacoa and the chicken is to die for! p.s great variety of sauces and the owner is totally cool and its byob!!!!
we started with fresh chips that were hot to the table and ordered guacamole that was flavorful and creamy.  i posted a pic. i ordered a 3 tacos, chicken, carne and grilled shrimp and all three were amazing, i dont know which one i liked best. beans and rice came with,  also excellent. i love that they have real mexican coke as well as a huge variety of other mexican sodas. my boyfriend got a chile relleno, and he just kept shaking his head yes, he says its very good. decor is nice,  bright colors and clean.  staff is friendly and made great recommendations.  im sure we will be back many times.  recommend!
wowweeee!!!!  this is the best taco i have had outside of mexico in a long time.  lets start with the salsa.  amazing stuff, they have a full salsa bar with a variety of homemade salsas.  each as tasty as the next!  the chips are cooked to order.  the guac is fresh, delicious and not overly mixed, so its like homemade!  i was excited at the prospect of ordering everything ala carte rather than being served a pound of beans and rice with everything although that is an option here.  i ordered up four tacos, the carne asada, al pastor, barbacoa and the chicken marinated and smoked in adoba sauce.  i really cant say what was better.   the meat is plentiful and they have bold flavors.  you dont even need the salsa, but i recommend it because there are some really spicy salsas to get your nose running!finally some mexican street tacos that taste like a mexican taco.  very reasonably priced.  they serve all their meats as tacos, burritos, and quesadillas.  they even offered menudo, chorizo, chile relleno and even a 21 day dryaged prime ribeye dinner, so they do it all!  if you want amazing mexican food, in a taco shop atmosphere, but with amazing flavor this is it!  tired of the usual bland bertos places?  me too!  you cant beat these guys!  a definite must for taco lovers!
if you live in tempe near the us 60 on mill ave or nearby, and have never been impressed by authentic mexican street tacos, you owe it to yourself to give this place a try. it is very special.this little joint sits in a strip mall corner unit complete with a picture window that provides breathtaking views of a drivethru liquor store. it is one of many local businesses alongside a 24 hour fitness club next to a pizza place. unassuming and uncomplicated come to mind. the service is friendly and prompt. glass bottled cane sugar sodas with spanish language labels are kept ice cold in a retrochic skinny coke machine behind the counter. large jars of tea and aguas frescas horchata and jamaica on my last visit gently sweat away on the counter, all of it kept very clean. the menu board lists prices that compete with any of the ubiquitous yellowsign anybertos that sum up the majority of authentic mexican quick service fare in the phoenix metro area.that earns 3 stars. why the other 2? this was quite simply one of the best meals i have ever eaten anywhere. they know their food is good, but allow it to speak for itself rather than boasting about how great it is.nearly everything is made in house, often from scratch, and ingredient not made there is carefully selected to reflect the same levels quality and authenticity i.e. they only use mexican cheese. the meats are all either grilled or smoked, and present a wide range of texture from chewy, crispy, crunchy, to tender, often in the same bite best al pastor ive had anywhere. while the meats are surprisingly light and nongreasy without being dry, this is probably not the best place for a diet, or a vegetarian.i ordered a 3taco dinner with carne asada, pollo adobado, and al pastor. the carne asada was fantastic, as good as any ive ever had. the adobado and al pastor tacos immediately triggered that perfect bite reflex; that moment where you just stop mid chew and slow down and savor every little detail, because your tastebuds are telling you youve found some of that really really good stuff. the beans and rice seemed to be made with equal attention to detail. the refried beans were the most flavorful ive ever had. not sure if they were using lard, but i could swear there was a faint cheeselike tang in there beyond the cheese melted on top.i will be going back for dinner tomorrow. and probably the next night until i can try everything on the menu.pros: incredible food from traditional recipes, great value, unpretentious and universally welcoming. byob and theres a liquor store with excellent beerwine next door.cons: sooner or later this place is going to get a visit and recommendation from a celebrity chef, and it will have a line. i wish they were open later.
made a visit here today for lunch. food was ready in record time. got the chicken tacos with rice and beans. no complaints here. fresh food, good service, no wait. will definitely be back soon.
i love this place! the food is amazing, reasonably priced, and everyone who works here is super friendly. ive gotten the taco special several times and tried a variety of meats, mostly the chicken and beef. ive also had the carnitas burrito and the dry ribs which are amazing!!!. everything has been spectacular. give it a try sometime!
had a craving for street tacos and saw the amazing reviews on this place so we had to come check it out! amazing service to start off with. we ordered about 5 different tacos and the taco salad. everything was great! the owner even helped us decide what sauces to add with each taco! will definitely be coming again :
im on a business trip and i want to eat some good, fairly priced food. i head to yelp to see what everyone has to say and read through reviews and pictures. i drive the 15 mins to tc tacos, and i am so glad i did. the joint looks a little sketchy at first, and the crowd is varied, i decided to get it togo, and eat at my hotel but thats where the negativeish comments end. the employees are so friendly. they greeted me the second i walked in. i told them id never been and asked what i should order. they proceeded to ask some questions about my taste preferences and where i was from.  i ended up ordering the 3 taco mealcarne asada, smoked pork and smoked chicken. rigoddamndiculous. i loved the special green salsa, the horchata a little on the sweet side, let the ice melt or add rum!.  the rice and beans were amazing too.  great experience.  would definitely recommend.
great authentic mexican food. great food, great service and great prices. love the variety of tasty food and sauced.
customer service was great, food was good, they want out of their way. specifically eric and jerry.
i am so happy they opened a permanent location!  no more waiting until fridays if i dont want to. their all thaid up is my favorite quesadilla in the world. the mix of cilantro salsa and chili sweet thai sauce is amazing. i usually dont like onions in any food but they add so much flavor to the chicken and cheese. their luncharitas are also something to look forward to. so refreshing and icy cold.
stopped in for lunch today and it was great. all the food seems to be made from scratch. the four different tacos were very good and they come with chips too. ask for the hot sriracha salsa as it has a good kick. the torta and carne fries sounded yummy.
i work down the street from this place. coworkers rave about it. now i know why. go get the carnitas! its so good! i dont know whats on it but the spices are great. the chips and salsa is perfect. not too salty, thick chips. the salsa isnt overly spicy and i could do shots of that stuff, its so good!
visiting phoenix for a conference and saw great reviews of this place on pinterest: luncha libre did not disappoint! we had the chickendilla, it was delicious! all the ingredients were fresh. the chips and salsa tasted amazing, just the right amount of spicy. the drinks are very refreshing, theyre served in huge mason jars you can take with you. prices are right on point. staff is super friendly and helpful. the place is nicely decorated with merchandise of mexican luchadores, very unique.will definitely be coming back to luncha libre everytime we come back to phoenix.
i enjoyed the food! my husband had the black and bleu, i had the taid up and my 14 month old had the lil dilla kid quesadilla. all were tasty and gooey with cheese. my toddler usually doesnt like tortillas but he ate this up! we had take out, but well try eating there next time.
great little hole in the wall restaurant.  daily specials, tacos and quesadillas. very good food and good service.  try it
great seasoned meat, full of flavor. the salsa is amazing with thick crunchy, salty chips that taste homemade.the most nicest people. great service, and actually cares for the customers. adorable mexican wrestling theme. the tres leche is to die for, and so are the tacos! its amazing that they went from a taco truck to an amazing not huge restaurant. i recommend this to anybody that wants an amazing family friendly, mexican food restaurant.
i first had luncha libre from the food truck. food is delicious and stays true to the food i tried at the truck. small menu, but everything ive tried so far is good. steak and bleu is my go to quesadilla. they have tacos here too.
do yourself a favor and go here for lunch. my friend had the torta and it looked amazing she said it was delicious. i had the carne tacos and the meat was flavorful and plentiful. the salsa  delicious. the corn tortillas were perfect and the perfect vessel for the meat. im gonna get them again i had the strawberry guava luncharita and it was refreshing. it wasnt too sweet and perfect for a hot day. i got a refill. the staff was super nice. the establishment is wonderfully decorated, but small. so i wouldnt go during the rush unless youre getting it to go. it takes a while to get your food because its made fresh to order and completely worth the wait. i looked around at other peoples plates and everything looked wonderful. the dillas looked perfect. next time i go, im getting one. lastly, we ended our meal with churros...geezeeee creezeee. they came out hot. bravo guys, bravo. ya gotta go. for the love of all that is good in this world, go!
went again today and the carnitas fries is amazing! the meat was perfectly cooked, the fries were crisp on the outside and mealy on the inside. theres a great amount of cheese. it came with sour cream and guacamole. oh and then topped with sriracha. great lunch and ill be going back again.
just ate here for the first time, had the all thaid up. the chicken was juicy and tender with a ton of flavor and a nice spice kick. tasty salsa too. definitely recommend.
just ate here tonight for the first time! yum!! got the thaid up dilla and loved the sweet thai flavor mixed with the salsa. my son wasnt going to eat at first he was being bratty and said he wasnt going to eat because he wanted a burger. right when he saw the dilla, he quickly changed his mind. he devoured his chicken dilla and next time im sure hell order without hesitation. we will be back! oh yes, i recommend ordering extra salsas if you are taking out they give a 2oz container, but it is so yummy that if you are like me, its gone in the first 2 bites:
the food and service were amazing! i love supporting local places. i ordered a carne asada taco and chicken taco. they were so overstuffed with meat and so tasty!
orgasmic...simply put...just amazing. their meat is juicy. their flavors are to die for! i get the all taid up....sweet and spicy!! the people working are always so helpful and fun to talk with. one of our favorite hidden gems...
this restaurant has been revamped. it was noche y dia. i was there with friend to catch a movie near by and was kind of  in a hurry. we mention that to the waiter and he was greatly attentive to our request.  we ordered and got our meals really fast :we ordered their signature salmon tatare, a grilled cheese duck sandwich with the chef salad. im not a tartare type but taste my friend salmon tartare and wow!!! i couldnt stop wanting a bite more and more lolli like grill cheese sandwich already and adding it with duck is out of this world hummm. so we share the chef salad with our plate was perfect. coming out of it was a light lunch at a reasonable cost. we made it to the movie on time thanks to the waiter :their menu is quite elaborate for a small neighbour. i will bring a date next time on the terrasse. the park in front of the restaurant make it charming and kind of romantic.
the joues de porc were out of this world. very fine cuisine. desserts made in house were incredibly creamy, tasty, full of flavor. nice wine list. excellent value and very attentive service. overall a beautiful evening. happy to have found a great bistro.
i think this place opened up in july 2015, so its still fairly new. i had lunch there with the afternoon. i had a pho soup, and beef with vermicelli. both were very good, and tasted fresh and crisp. the service was pleasant and efficient. but what i also really like is the ambience: the restaurant has high ceilings, big bright windows, and nice lines. the air conditioning is good i was there on a very hot day in july. its not a fancy place  for example, the owners young child was in a corner booth watching a video  but thats the kind of place i like. in short, this is perhaps the best vietnamesethai restaurant in kitchenerwaterloo.
another summer monsoon rolled through town yesterday leaving my truck spotty and dirty. thanks to clean freak, my truck is bright and shiny again. the monthly plan is perfect for me. its quick and easy to use the drive thru wash then a quick dry and vacuum. done in 15 minutes. as a real estate agent, i want my truck to look sharp while i am with clients.
i love that this place has opened up so close to our house.  we took advantage of their opening special and still have a membership.  we are getting great use out of it.  the staff is always friendly and full of smiles.
i only come here for the patbingsoo. it is shaved ice topped with fruits and ice cream, how can you go wrong with a dish like that.
wow, the snow ice is different here and melts in your mouth.  its crushed ice, but more like snow flakes. ill be back again.
i found this place on my way into the market. i figured that this place should be no different than any other coffee place. i went in with my family and looked around. this place gives off a warm feeling as if its home. i must admit that the snow ice caught my eye. not because its snow ice but because it was the one i had tasted in la. i had ordered the combinaton snow ice and let me just say that it is way more than you expect. i had only paid 10.80 for it and it was plenty for 3. score! i also had the green tea latte cold and it was really good. plus did i mention that they use organic products? they have a variety of milks and syrup you can mix and match with! the cashier was so friendly they are so willing to adjust to your needs. service is great i mean where can you go to a coffee shop and feel so comfortable. its such a shame to see this place go to waste i hope this place picks up more! :
the spa was clean and much more relaxing and inviting than other foot spas ive been to.  i left feeling great and will definitely be back!!!
whenever i come here, i leave relaxed and happy. theyre really good about checking in with you periodically on the strength of the massage, so you can definitely cater each experience to your needs of that day.
best  place i ever been，i had a good experience there today，they have professional skill，i will be back very soon
great new reflexology place! ive been here twice with different masseuses and they were both amazing. i feel like they have better technique than the other foot spas, plus theyre much cleaner and offer more privacy. ive been to pretty much all the reflexology places in town so i know what im talking about, lol. they have a 25 for 60 minutes special right now. will definitely be back for sure!
as the valley restaurant scene continues its meteoric rise, theres often one knock that the valley gets from out of towners and even locals alike.  a lack of traditions.  thats not to say there arent iconic brands to be found in the phoenix area, but even most of them havent withstood the test of time going all the way back to before phoenix was the sprawling desert oasis it is today.  but once in awhile, you can find one.  though the classic deli restaurant certainly wasnt invented here in the valley, theres one family that has stuck to its roots while still embracing the valleys ever changing culinary landscape.  in fact their formula has been so successful, its now spanned a whopping six decades plus.  say hello to phoenixs iconic miracle mile delicatessen.  and say a big hello to their newest location on the southeast corner of 16th street and campbell.ive known the garcia family since grade school and i can clearly remember going to visit josh and his parents at their old location at christown mall all those years ago.  in the years since, miracle mile has changed addresses a few times, but never changed what made them a valley staple.  the food and the friendly service.  today was a big day for the garcia family as they opened their very first stand alone restaurant.  after seeing a pair of local news stations showing off the place that morning, i grabbed my dad and we beelined it straight here for dinner.  we actually got here just before the big dinner crowd started to swarm so our timing was perfect.the new location is beautiful and does a good job of striking an uneasy but necessary balance.  the setup will look perfectly familiar to those whove come to miracle mile for years.  walk up to the line to order your food at the counter, they serve it all to you on a tray, seat yourself, and enjoy.  but josh has clearly put his stamp on this new location in some subtle but noticeable ways.  for one, they now have a rotation of craft brews on tap to choose from today they had brews from deschutes, san tan, four peaks, and papago.  additionally, they now have a take out window for those of us particularly in the lunch crowd who love to grab and go.  and the design of the menu up front is now digital with some clever animation.  so a good balance between appealing to their loyal clientele while also making some subtle adaptations to draw in the 20 and 30 somethings as well.  theres also ample parking big plus and ample seating both inside and on the outside patio looking out towards 16th street.but for all the impressive aesthetics that the new miracle mile brings to the table, the one true measure of their longevity is the food.  ive had friends in the food industry that took me to their establishments and while i always appreciated the invite, some places simply dont deliver a product that would make me come back frequently.  not so with miracle mile.  whether its the brisket, the corned beef, the pastrami or the wide variety of desserts, ive never had a bad meal here.  today was no different.  today i grabbed a huge hot pastrami sandwich on kaiser bread with a side of fries, a pickle another thing theyre famous for, and also grabbed one of their gigantic slices of cheesecake.  to wash it all down i went with a local craft brew, a glass of san tan hefeweizen.  total price for the sandwich, sides, cheesecake, beer and tax came to just under 25.  the pastrami was just as delicious and the portions just as huge as i remember.  i still cant decide if i like the pastrami better on their kaiser or their sourdough bread, but i digress.  dont ask me how i was able to eat that massive cheesecake slice, but trust me it was worth it.  miracle mile didnt skimp on portion sizes in the past, and they still dont.so anytime someone tells you phoenix doesnt have great restaurant traditions or doesnt put a premium on the icons of the past, do them a favor and bring them here.  the location may be new, but the formula for miracle miles success is as original as its recipes.  whether youre an old timer, a big family with kids, or just someone who puts a premium on supporting local, the garcia family has a six decade formula that delivers some incredibly delicious results.  and theyve got three generations worth of customers to prove it.
outstanding. im still lickin my chops. had the straw; cant go wrong with pastrami in an oniion roll with swiss cheese  sour kraut. if you havent had the treat of a miricle mile deli meal then you are missing out.
met the girls for lunch at the new place. everything was great. the food and service was on par. my one complaint was the weird parking area, who designed it?  some bored mad architect? this is the processalways enter at the south entrance on 16th st....if you try to enter at the north entrance...you will quickly remember my advice. when you leave do the reverse. youve been warned!
the last thing i thought miracle mile would serve would be breakfast. my dad took my daughter and i for breakfast after church because none of us can stand daily dose. the wait was shots and the prices at miracle mile are reasonable.the food is excellent!!!!!! its the most basic food but they cook it so well and the customer service is amazing. im glad  they moved locations because the new location is beautiful and clean. they food is served nice and not and the servers are very sweet. i have gone back several times for their cinnamon roll pancakes.
i came across this place by accident and been eating there weekly since january 2015 and can say the following things about the place.staffthe nicest staff in any food service establishment in the valley. staff takes time out to talk with the customers. they know customers by name and always smiling.atmospherenice and welcoming atmosphere. the 19th street location was almost like a cafeteria atmosphere with all the colors and white. it reminded me of the 1980s but can say it was so clean that i would have ate my food off the floor. the new location on 16th street is awesome. complete opposite of the previous. i really like the take out window!!!foodi have tried almost everything on the menu and can say hands down that i have not had a bad meal yet. the food is always fresh and delicious. it appears to be very high quality food at a very reasonable price. i would rather drive the extra 15 minutes and get a quality meal at miracle mile than a fast food establishment next to my house. i like the rewards card that they offer with the free meal after the tenth visit. embarrassed to say that i have already gone through five cards. i may have a problem. lol!!!!!!recent visit went in for breakfast on 06212015 for the second time and decided to order the asparagus french toast but  was told they were out of asparagus after selling eight in a couple hours compared to a few a week.. instead, i got omelet  which was great. i like that i can pick what i want in the omelet, which i usually only like vegetables. management gave me a 15.00 gift card because of the inconvenience, apologized and asked if they could make me a side of french toast. i told him it was okay and will wait until next time. overall thoughtthis is one of the only places i will eat at in the valley besides one other establishment in tempe marketplace. i noticed that there increased some of the prices by 0.50 with the new location. i really didnt mind the increase because you get a lot for your money and it is really good quality. you can tell a lot about a place by the condition of their restrooms and the kitchen. both are extremely clean and smell fresh, which is a huge thing for me when eating out. .plus, staff are always washing their hands, which is another use plus about this place. i will continue to eat at this establishment weekly as long as they continue to provide the same quality of food and friendly atmosphere.
miracle mile moved from the collonade to 16th street and campbell and it is hot indeed. the one item not included in the fresh new decor and new sharp uniforms was a parking structure. it has a 50 percent smaller footprint, lunch crowds can be out the door and cars crawl the lot like argentine fire ants rush your toes when you step on their lawn. the drivers hopefully wishing somebody will pull out and go home.but everyones inside chowing down on traditional deli fare.
my first time trying the new location. the restaurant is beautiful, the service staff is very helpful and best of all the food is fantastic. my only complaint is that i live 30 miles away.
the new location is beautiful!   as always, the food was fresh and delicious.  the staff is always super friendly and helpful.  they are always smiling, and dont seem to hate their jobs like the staff of a lot of other places you visit.  miracle mile is always a treat!!
exceeding expectations.i felt i needed to update my review on miracle mile delicatessen.  after a recent posting on yelp about my dining experience at miracle mile i was contacted by josh,  business manager at miracle mile.josh and i spoke about my dining experience and at the end of our conversation i felt great. after my convesation with josh i now know why miracle mile has been in the valley for over sixty years. a philosophy of tradition, pride, excellent customer service,and great food is why miracle mile stands out.customer service, in my opinion, means exceeding  expectations. all of us  expect a certain level of service, and some expect more than others. however,  when a business exceeds those expectations, it should be acknowledged and that is exactly what miracle mile has done, they exceeded my expectations.   in my oponion,  that is what i call the  wow factor.  its not often that i find myself saying wow, i didnt expect that or that was beyond what i expected but thanks to josh that is exactly what happened.  thanks, again  josh for caring about the experience your customers have at your restaurant and a special thanks for the gift card!
just updating to mention that miracle mile has made me some great catering trays as well over the years.  today was no different. i got a couple of large catering trays a dessert sampler and a fruit salad to go for a lunchtime work function.  they do offer delivery for large orders, but today i just grabbed them myself.  they were a huge hit particularly the cheesecake and brownies.  as soon as i mentioned where i got them from my coworkers immediately talked about how much they missed miracle miles old location at arrowhead mall.  needless to say, both the fruit salad and desserts were polished off in record time.  josh, youve been put on notice.  the west side wants their miracle mile back.
i love the food here because its freshly made.  i ordered online for lunch and when i got there to pick it up, they hadnt made it yet but i was offered a drink on the house.  this is how you do business and this is why this place is successful.i love the new location and im glad they didnt move far at all.
miracle mile opened in my neighborhood a couple months ago so i had to go and try there lunch which i did excellent dinner breakfast all very good highly recommend this wonderful employees and very clean very modern.
grew up in phoenix and miiracle mile deli has always been a favorite! new locationstand alone building is really quite nice....bright, colorful and oh so clean! cafeteria style still holds up well! pastrami at this venue never disappoints! marble rye was fresh baked! arrived early for lunch and stayed long after the busy lunch crowd departed! plain cheesecake was delicious and portion was ample to share! looking forward to returning soon for dinner with wine! :
ive been going to miracle mile since i was a kid and its still as good as it gets!!just thinking about it, poststraw, is making my mouth water..new location is certainly smaller than the other locations that were around the valley, but definitely cleaner and likely a much needed upgrade for all. thanks for hanging in there miracle mile!!
have been a fan of mmd for years, even when they were on central. now that they have their own new building on 16th st. i really like the atmosphere. the y food has always been great jewish deli food. try their weekend breakfasts. theyre the bomb!
my husband and i had lunch here today and it was very good.  his sandwich was meaty, fresh and the roll was out of this world good.   i had a staten island salad and could not finish it.  the romaine lettuce was crisp.  i had blue cheese on the side and wished it had been home made.   it was a little runny and no chunks of blue cheese.   but over all, a great lunch.  love the new building.  the bus boys were really nice and polite.
this restaurant looks very clean on the inside. came over to order a simple breakfast. the food here is delicious. the employees here seem to show a lot of enthusiasm than anyplace that i know. this is a great place.
my husband mentioned enjoying miracle mile years ago when he saw this location was being built. we were on our way home and looking for a place to have some dinner when we passed by and saw that it was open. very nice atmosphere inside and the selection of food was wonderful. i couldnt resist the cod with yummy baked cheese and lemon topping on it  and some macaroni and cheese... all delicious! my husband enjoyed the new yorker. he loves good pastrami and his sandwich didnt disappoint and the coleslaw side was a perfect touch. my husband had surveyed the assortment of desserts before we sat down and even though our meal was very filling we couldnt resist the chocolate cake and cherry cheesecake. needless to say, we could barely breathe by the time we headed out to our car. with such delicious food and a wonderful, relaxing atmosphere, well be coming back soon... and well be sharing with friends and family.
has always been one of my favorites. best selection of pastrami sandwiches in town. fries and pickles excellent.dinner entrees are superb. if you like stuffed cabbage its fab. the cod entree is a must try if u havent had it. everything you can order is cooked perfectly and tasty. only issue is what to order because its all so good!
again ,awesome sandwiches, awesome service, clean, and all staff are friendly and attentive, troy and eric are just so nice and do an excellent job !!!
so i went because i have been in before and my parents enjoy the food.plus i had a craving for something just wasnt sure what.the cup of matzah ball soup was bland. there was no taste to the soup. almost like water with a very faint chicken flavor. could have used some chicken fat to live it up. the matzah balls were tender and lacked flavor again chicken fat though fattening works wonders on adding immense flavor.their reuben was unbelievable though! seriously! the rye bread was crispy and buttery, plenty of caraway seeds and tons of meat, that was juicy and good. sauerkraut was tangy with almost a hint of sweetness that may have come from the dressing. very tangy dressing could be homemade or not but it had a lot pickles and the cheese that melted right into things. well done sandwich! but for me a big portion so i took home half a sandwich to warm up. reminded of delis on the east coast, namely in ct.and yes the reuben definitely hit the spot on my craving.please note i did ask about how they fry their french fries and the line cooks were very conscious of what type of oil they used and so i was allowed to substitute the side of fries with a cup of matzah ball soup.
a free standing miracle mile hell yes! since the downfall of the locations i grew up with at park central, and christown malls, the closing of the locations at both arrowhead and what used to be the colonade mall turned into some kind of strip mall place, i was thinking i would never again get to have a hot pastrami sandwich from a place that has been in my life since i moved to phoenix at the age of 4 and that had been in my maternal families life since before then.we came on a sunday around noon after we were at the cemetery for the unveiling of my grandmothers headstone. it was hadhas been an emotional time and going to a place that had an historical place in my memory and in our family seemed somewhat appropriate. the only thing that was missing was the karshas rye bread karshas closed and the rye bread they are using isnt quite as tasty, with the right kind of pull. the pastrami was just like all of my memories. mm used to be a jewish deli and has been jewish style for years and years now. my husband loved his turkeyblta and his side knish and everyone else enjoyed what they had. private parking lot and perfectly planned thick covered door handle coverings so you dont burn your hands opening the door.looking forward to coming back.
love the new location. it looks even more of east coast diner. most new yorklike deli around. everything ive had is good. the corned beef sandwich is is so good that the sandwich does not need any cheese or condiments because it is good by itself.the fries are actually pretty bad and need some seasoning. i also wish the prices were a little more reasonable. other than that this place is amazing!!!!dont forget to check in on yelp to get a free mac and cheese!
excellent food! awesome service! spotless establishment!  have tried many of their main menu dishes and none have disappointed me! you will not go hungry here! many yummy dessert choices too. the cheesecake is my fave! they even cater to the little tykes with a coupon for a free cookie and toy! so head on over there... whatcha waitin for?!
this place is exceptionally popular around lunch time and for good reason!upon walking in youre engulfed by sweetsavory aromas and the quiet din of dozens of conversations. the line to order is usually 515 groups deep, which provides just enough time to scope the menu, listen to other guests, and debate amongst your party what to get.the menu consists of 7 adjacent 40 televisions floating above the serving line and offers a typical, albeit, varied and delicious selection for a deli. these televisions also scroll through different pictures of popular dishes. if you didnt bring your appetite, thats okay, after a few pictures it will be sure to find you.the food is incredible. high quality cuts of meat, hefty portions, and an appropriate price. pictures just cant do it justice.the serving staff, cashiers, and bussers are exceedingly friendly and very accommodating.tips for lunch time: 1. carpool. carpool. carpool. the place is deceivingly large and can hold an impressive number of people.2. get a seattable for your group when you walk in. or dont  staff seem try to find you a place or make a place for you  did i mention they were accommodating?3. unless you have a 2 hour nap scheduled after lunch, get a box. you can eat the entire meal in one sitting and be completely satisfied, but dont say i didnt warn you about the impending food coma.this place is everything and more than what im looking for in a place to eat.
this place recently opened up down the street from my house and im loving it so far!  the cold brewed coffee and freshly made bagels are amazing. the staff is very friendly and inviting.  the decor inside is awesome and feels comfortable, you could definitely hang out here while enjoying your bagel and coffee. side note: i definitely recommend the asiago bagel with italian herb and chive cream cheese  and their delicious cold brewed coffee. keep up the great work guys!
great local spot. freshest bagels ive ever had. try the everything bagel with cream cheese. mmmm.
great tasting fresh bagels with exceptional espresso! had am everything bagel with lox, was not disappointed at all with this price point. the owner is fun and talkative, outdoor seating, and hipsteresque interior are welcome additions to this quiet location near hiking and biking trails.
excellent place for coffee and bagels, will definitely go again and recommend to others. great customer service!!
definitely one of the best bagel places in town. i overheard them say they boil their bagels, old school! which would certainly make a favorable difference. ive only been in a couple times and both times ordered the bagel and lox. the bagel was perfectly chewy and super fresh and they gave a generous amount of salmon with a huge slice of tomato and plenty of cream cheese. it also comes with onion but i got it without it was so delicious and actually quite filling. the girl working the counter, heaven, was very nice and welcoming  a real pleasure to talk to. such a nice change from the places where the person behind the counter barely looks at you.this is the kinda place where it would be easy to become a regular. a great addition to the phoenix bagel scene! if thats a thing  ha!
had heard this place was good but hadnt had an opportunity to stop by.  went today and had a bagel and shmear.  it was amazing but not nearly as amazing as the owner and young man who was working there.  they were very friendly and courteous.  i had a taste of their cold brew coffee...it was awesome!  i will go back earlier in the morning and get one soon.  want to sleep tonight or i would have had one.  thanks and i will be back soon.
this is a great independent bagel and coffee place! i love this place! bagels made fresh! the lox and bagels are the bomb! owner ryan is very friendly and personable! support local ahwatukee!!
excellent bagels and nice coffee, sweet to have them here!
great tasting bagels. nice and clean shop. very friendly staff. i will definitely be back
great bagels, great coffee!food:ryan, the owner, is fanatic about his product! he takes great pride in his coffees and teas, and especially his bagels. and its justified! the bagels are handmade on the premises each day. my favorite is the jalapeno cheddar bagel with horseradish bacon smear. excellent!cost:very reasonable.service: ryan and his staff are always smiling and friendly. and fast at filling orders.atmosphere:casual. very casual. overall:i agree with other reviewers, this is probably the best bagel shop in ahwatukee. its a bit off the beaten path, but head on over, you wont be disappointed!
bagel texture and flavors oustanding.  made in house fresh and you can tell.  fun and friendly, great shmears, and exceptional coffee.   hard to find a place that kust does everything so well.
what an awesome bagel shop. i think this bagel shop could be the revitalization, the shopping center at the bottom of equestrian needs. it has a very hip environment, and the owner ryan and staff are easy going, fun loving people, that help make the atmosphere. odelay is exactly the type of shop that ahwatukee needs more of. the quality of the bagel is impressively crafted, with a crunch to the outer shell and a nice fluffy inside. i go at lunch time and their tea and turkey bagel sandwich is incredible... ive been to odelay bagel for 4 days straight this week. if you are a local resident and you want more spots like this, come and show your patronage. they are still new and still figuring out processes so the service is a little on the slow side. so dont go if youre in a big rush. but give them some time and they will have that ironed out for sure.
always fresh always friendly service. ryan has the best bagels and cream cheese with unique flavors i have found. love the black pepper parmesan bagel with garlic siracha cream cheese. you will not regret it!!
great place for bagels. the menu isnt very big yet but its still good. clean inside and definitely more unique than most other bagel joints.

okay, ill admit it, i really like this place.  ordered two dozen bagels for thanksgiving and everybody in our family was impressed.  but then i ventured to the most flavorful combination yet.  jalapenocheddar bagel split and toasted with baconhorseradish cream cheese.  i know what youre thinking, but dont judge till you chew.  the jalapeno flavor is not in your face, but somehow a smooth deep background flavor in the bagel that is full of flavor with gentle warmth.  that same careful integration of flavor applies to the cream cheese, and together, amazing.  my family went gaga over the veggie cream cheese on just about everything, and the young kids came to blows over the cinnamon raisin bagels.  big mistake not to have a couple more of those.  awesome job.  genuine, real deal.
what makes this gym different is its neurological approach to fitness. at first i had no clue what that really meant, until i started my evaluations with peter pinto who is awesome by the way he helped me work through a lot of my coordination issues and awkwardness. there are a few different options to choose from, from semiprivate classes, one on one training, muay thai, and boxing. the muay thai and boxing classes are meant to actually train you with real technical skill, so youre really learning quite a bit about how the body moves, and you will also get a pretty hardcore workout. for people needing more physical therapy and neurological training or just looking to get a great workout me peter will let you know what you need and come up with a plan for you. ok, so for those of you wondering about price... it can be a little pricey starting at 120.00 pm but i think its worth it, and ill tell you why. my whole life ive been overweight, i honestly would have given anything to be fit and healthy. i have done yoga, which is great but i wasnt seeing the kind of results i wanted. i did cross fit, which was ok, but i found it to be intimidating and like i was just going through the motions. i did the whole gym membership thing, but that was not very effective either because i would get bored easily and i didnt really have enough support from a personal trainer. fit life is different because im learning so much about myself that its impossible to lose that information even if i decided to quit, im naturally correcting imbalances just by showing up. another thing i like is that there are always extra things like hikes and events that you can choose to do or not. it can be very community driven. ok, so thats it im done, babbling on about this place. just check it out for yourself!
in my opinion what drew me in to the gym right away was the positive atmosphere of everyone in it. it is a very supportive and positive atmosphere, just what one would be looking for to work off that weight in the most constructive atmosphere possible. peter, the owner, is an extremely nice and supportive guy, someone you just have to meet. the classes you can take as an adultmuay thai or boxing, are full of kind and helpful classmates who will give you the help you need along with the coaches. overall my time there has been nothing but positive! would recommend.
ive been going to fitlife fusion sityodtong for close to a year or so now and have been loving it.  i was doing muay thai on and off for a few years but never really fell in love or truly enjoyed going as much as i do now.  peter is by far the best coach ive had because he gauges where your skill level is at as well as physically and adjusts your so that you feel like youre being pushed while not overdoing it which can easily lead to injury.  he also has immense knowledge on the neurological aspect of fitness and has helped me increase my flexibilty, coordination, and just an overall understanding of how my body works.  peters spent a lot of time training with world class muay thai fighters in thailand and in boston; so needless to say he can train anyone in muay thai.  if youre looking for a place to train where you dont have to be selfconscious and just want to learn here is the place to do it.
i give this place five stars because we went in 1 minute to closing and they took our order with smiles, and people kept coming until we left and they took those people too well after closing! the general manager vicky approached us and asked how everything was. i ordered a chai latte which was delicious, and an eclair which was amazing! everyone was working hard, and i know this location is new and everyone was still getting into the groove of everything but i really dont have a bad thing to say about this location! keep it up guys!!
ok, so this place is much better than their original location on davidson. first off, so many seats. at the location on davidson, finding a seat is near impossible. but here, the location is a sea of chairs, sofas, and tables. also, there are two  bathrooms, so no lines. besides that, the pastries and ambience are identical to that of the original location.
ever have a bite of food so stupidly delicious that you cant find words to describe the bite? thats how i feel trying to describe my lunch at amelies on monday. i ordered the turkey and brie sandwich on a baguette with a seasonal compote and cucumber salad. i also took some desserts to go, including a salted caramel brownie, pistachio petit four, and some mini chocolate raspberry bites. everything was amazing, from service to food. i cant wait to go back.
what a joy to have a location closer to my moms house! i dont live in town but am a long time amelies fan. i no longer have to drive 3540 minutes to get my beloved twicebaked almond croissant. although, as the other reviewers pointed out, the staff could use some customer service training. they seem annoyed at their job and the customers. however this will not deter me from returning.
the wife and i ate here on a beautiful sunday. my daughter told me how good everything is here, so we gave it a try. i had the roast beef on a baguette with horseradish and cheese. i also had the asparagus leek soup. both were awesome. my wife had the turkey and bacon on a croissant. so good. of course we had to take home some french pastries. great food, the price is right,and its less than 2 miles from our house. we will be back and often.
wow, now its not the amalies of charlotte here in pineville but the fare is just as good. love the soups as they are homemade. this amalies has a coffee, wine, beer bar. they are just the best i you are looking for a dessert of quality. just the best.
gela is a hair guru! she truly is a master at her trade. my hair has never looked or felt more nourished and healthy, which living in this dry climate of las vegas is quite a feat. my first appointment with gela was about 6 years ago. i came in with dry, damaged overprocessed hair, and left with shiny hair, full of volume, and the most amazing cut i had ever gotten. i have been a client ever since.i hired gela to style hair for my wedding in mexico. the conditions were not the greatest, but gela managed to work wonders. the humidity was out of control, the ac did not work properly, and there were alot of girls in a very small space. gela somehow managed to make everyone look and feel incredible. you can count on gela to know the latest trends in color and style. she takes pride in educating her clients on different products and what they are doing for the hair. she will never steer you in the wrong direction if your hair type or face shape is not suitable for the style. not only is she amazing at what she does, gela is so much fun and personable. its always so nice visiting with her, and leaving looking and feeling like a new woman. gela is an artist when it comes to hair.

i have been getting my hair done by gela for many years and at this point, there is simply no alternative. she is the best hairstylist i have ever met and her passion truly shows in her work. she is extremely knowledgable and dedicated to her craft. i can always rely on her to deliver amazing results and never fear for the integrity of my hair. stylists like gela are a dime a dozen! i feel very fortunate to have met her.
i hired gela to do hair at my daughters wedding in tulum, mexico a few weeks ago. she was absolutely amazing! she is truly a miracle worker when it comes to styling hair. although the humidity of the environment posed a serious challenge during the event, gela was a true professional and made everyone look and feel beautiful. i am so happy with our decision to hire her. her knowledge and expertise is unparalleled. thank you gela!
i started with gela 2.5 years ago... blonde hair damaged from a bad aveda dye job in nyc where i just box dyed it black out of frustration bad choice fyi and then showed up in her chair when i moved to vegas. lets make your hair healthy again she said... and with that, we started a journey of using the right products kerastase obviously!, trims, her moving salon locations, and i even started extensions to give my natural hair a break from the harshness of styling since you really style your extension hair, giving your regular hair a much needed break. all that work... and now my hair is what i always wanted finally long longer than the extensions!, healthy, and feels amazing!!! see progression photo from exactly 2.5 yrs ago today! definitely go see gela... i was at my wits end and she not only restored my faith in my hair but in the fact that genuine stylists that still want the best for your hair are still out there go see her today!!!
agreeing w the post before. al nails salons will trash talk you, try to get money out of you, etc. i know cause ive worked in some. but this is actually a decent nail salon.

the best suits and service! there is something for every one. the customer device was on point with suggestions from the highly knowledgeable staff. a must go!!!
ive been watching the progress on this lot for a awhile... now the convenience store is open and reasonably priced might i add.  they even had my almond breeze milk available for those of us with allergies to soy milk..  well i was craving a starbucks coffee at 10 :11 pm on a sunday.  its brand new.  very nicely stocked.  the employees behind the counter were friendly and greeted us as we walked in.  barbie was really apologetic when she didnt see my boyfriend standing at the counter.  she and her coworker really nice to us, even stuck up a small talk conversation! : she didnt have a name tag but she had glasses and was african american.  great work ethic as they were talking about something work related.1.99 for this starbucks vanilla iced coffee, it hit the spot!! whats better is its directing across from our guard gated community so i could walk if need be on a summer night.. they will have gas on the june 28th 2015.
thank you citi stop for sponsoring our cricket jerseys! thank you for give back to the community.
gas at 2.43 if you pay cash or debit. what a deal. i looked on gas buddy before leaving my house for gas and seen that vons and 76 was both 2.43. costco was 2.45. i figure i would just stop at 76. upon pulling in there were no lines unlike vons. i was able to pick a pump. upon going inside the store, the store is very clean and organize. the guy working was very friendly and thanked me for my business. i only got 20 but hey if they stay cheaper then costco or vons i will continue coming back. they also have a tv on the screens of the pumps will you can see the weather and watch extra tv show while you pump your gas.great job 76 citi stop. i will continue coming back.pros:easy access clean gas islandclean storefriendly servicecheap gas
have bought multiple sets of wheels and tires over the last 10 years with rob, ryan and their crew of wheel experts.  always top notch service, theyve never steered me wrong and the prices are always awesome!!!i wouldnt hesitate to recommend them to anyone whether in az or elsewhere, i have had out of state friends order from pete and everything was impeccable.thanks element!!
top notch service every time. if you are looking for a reputable wheel and tire shop give peter a call. it doesnt matter if you are looking for aftermarket replacement wheels or even stock they have what you need. i will not go anywhere else, i suggest you do the same.
pete has always provided excellent customer service and the best price possible. he goes out of his way to make the customer happy. you will not be disappointed with the level of expertise and willingness to provide a pleasant transaction.
i was looking for a special gift for my sons 18th birthday. i called element and spoke with pete about some suggestions. he was very helpful and i purchased the perfect gift. my son was amazed that his mom would be so cool  thank you for all your help. ill be sure to recommend your shop.
both customer service and pricing were great at element! if youre looking for someone who knows what theyre talking about you wont be disappointed. pete was very helpful in choosing the right wheels i was in the market for.
i went here to mount and balance a set of light weight racing wheels.  both the facility and service were top notch!  adam, the service technician who handled the wheel mounting and balance was both professional and courteous.  if you have a nice set of wheels and dont want to risk it at the chain tire shops then this is the place to go.  well maintained equipment, spotless organized shop, and professional staff.
element was simply superior in every way possible than any other company i spoke with regarding the wheels for my ml 400.from service to advice look no further. i live in california and have the pick of dealers and wheels as most wheel companies are situated here.i worked with robert and pete because they really gave me their time and energy to make sure i was happy. and i am! thank guys.
ryan was very helpful when it came to getting new wheels for my 2005 e55 amg. not only did they get the wheels in just 3 days but they also got me in and out of there in comfort. as your vehicle is getting worked on you can relax in their waiting room with wifi and a movie on. but this was just a bonus. the pricing, customer service, and attention is what made this an enjoyable experience. thank you, i will be back at some point.
if you need rims and tires and you want high end selection with awesome service and pricing, go see robert or pete at element. awesome facility, top notch service. they have road force balancing and any rim and tire you can imagine. highly recommend you check them out. you wont be sorry.
great company stand behind their products, robert did everything to make things easy. highly recommended will do business again.  thanks robert and all at element wheels. cheers kevin
i got some tsw monacos from obed  he did not shove other products down my throat. he did give me a lot of insight on my purchase. very professional  all i can say is 5 stars is not enough. tom bennett,lockport, ny
all i gotta say is that i found my aj 1 pinnacle here! i couldnt believe that they actually had few in stock after it has been released for about a week now. super happy with purchase. staff was really nice as well.
5 stars isnt enough for this place. we went in for the friends and family night before the grand opening and to say we were impressed is a huge understatement. friendliest service, a diverse and knowledgable staff, inviting atmosphere with oldies and soul music, and an unbelievable menu. if there is spinach and artichoke dip on the menu, we order it  and this was the best weve ever had. hop cat has enough beer to satisfy any wisconsinite voted top 3 pub in the world. check out madisons new hot spot  we will be back. :
i went to the family and friends open tonight, it was amazing. the food was great and the building is stunning. having been first introduced to hopcat back in michigan i was nothin short of thrilled when i heard hopcat was coming to madison. this will be a place i will frequent. cant wait for the full tap list!
crack fries: aptly named. beer selection: ridiculous. burgers: gigantic and tasty. staff: exceptionally attentive especially since it was the first day. to be honest i went in expecting to be let down because it seems like the kind of thing i would hate, but they seem to have figured out a really solid recipe for making this behemoth establishment something interesting and worthy of return visits. i was especially impressed with the service as our waiter was super friendly, knowledgable, and on top of everything. im also excited for their killer happy hour specials half off burgers and 3 taps! and their giant bloody mary bar on sundays. the real test will be seeing what the atmosphere is like when the students return as that will really make or break a place like this for me and my friends.
okay, hopcat, color me impressed. hopcat you can be my best madison beer friend with extra benefits. you promised so much, and i was left skeptical. your offerings were written like a profile on eharmony. everyone lies on those a little bit so i assumed not everything you said could be true! hopcat lives up to the hype that has been blasting throughout madison social media. if you love beer, this bar is the place in madison for you to check out.i didnt even on plan on stepping in on your grand opening, but it just happened to work out. i had a friend from out of town visiting, and we were hanging out at the capitol. we decided 3:00 would be a good time for a brew so we stopped by hopcat to give the new place a shot.when we walked it, it was completely packed. i was quite interested in trying out the new beer house in town so i was willing to wait the 30 minutes that was apparently needed for a table because they were so slammed. well, the table only took about 5 minutes so im not going to complain there!when you first walk in, you are going to notice the massive floor plan and giant bar on the ground floor, as well as, the giant staircase that leads up to more of this giant beer house. the second floor is about half the size of the first, maybe a little smaller. the bar is significantly smaller than the one downstairs. the main bar has 130 beers on tap from around the country and many more in bottles from around the world. the upstairs bar has 30 local beers on tap. my tip, if youre impatient is to order local beers if youre seated upstairs. if you like trying new things like me, you wont mind the slightly longer wait for a beer to be transported from downstairs.did i mention that there are 130 beers on tap? well, there are, and i am truly impressed by the diverse, well organized beer list that has been assembled. the list even includes a key that educates the customer about glass type and size. i truly did not feel overwhelmed, despite the number of beers, because the list was well curated. mega props for pulling this off. i have felt overwhelmed with much smaller lists. the tap list was also dated so it appears that the list will be rotating frequently. i am happy to see this, although i doubt i will wear the current list out any time soon.we were served two orders of crack fries with our beers. they were both free for the grand opening, but im glad that we got to try them because im not sure if i would have randomly ordered these. they were very good with the cheese sauce that the fries came with. the fries alone were slightly overpowering on the seasoning. there was a lot of pepper and salt on them, but the cheese balanced out the seasoning. i would have liked to see a little more garlic and less peppersalt to mellow the spices out a tad.our server was quite attentive. i jumped the gun a little bit by asking another server for waters because we hadnt received any. our server came back with a 2nd set of waters as soon as he returned oops. i am just assuming that they were so slammed this afternoon that he had a lot to juggle.the atmosphere feels very trendy, and i appreciate the classic rock images plastered all over the walls. its a little loud but not unbearably so for this type of establishment. i could still hear my friend at the table. the awesome classic rock mix playing over the sound system was greatly appreciated.the management encourage that you carve into the table with whatever knife or other sharp object you brought with you. do not assume the people before you are rude. table carving is hopcats trendy thing. add a note!hopcat, youre a coolcat, and i would like to bring more of my friends over to try out what youre offering. i can see myself staking out a table for many hours to poke around your beer list some more. as a beer  wine drinker, i truly appreciate what the well curated list that you are offering this community. there is beer and mediocre tap selections everywhere in madison, but i think i finally found a place that the proud beer lovers of madison can call their home.keep up the good work. im honestly unsure how you made such a beer behemoth run smoothly. you are the mussolini of beer he made the trains run on time. lets hang out again sometime soon!
amazing place! beer manager even came out and talked to us about the beers they offer and where we could get them. crack fries are to die for. staff knows the importance of customer service.
the newest hottest joint in madison. it is where all the cool kids are going. a few things to remember before you step into the vortex of beer and crack fries.  no one under 21 unless accompanied by a guardian. no one under 21 after 10:00 pm.  come hungry and thirsty. now lets get rolling. you walk through the door to be greeted by an array of friendly staff, have your i.d. ready. once you get your table prepare to read. the beer list is extensive. 30 beers on tap from wisconsin that dont change 100 rotating beers on tapthe food. i just cant get past the crack fries. vladimir poutine: crack fries with potato and cheese pierogi, cheese curds, stout caramelized onions and cherry smoked bacon smothered in sour creme gravy. buffalo rolls: simple and delicious. tender chicken coated in house made buffalo sauce wrapped in wantons. it was crunchy on the outside yet the inside layer of the wanton had a nice chewy texture to it  wings: i am an avid supporter of wings. i just feel like it is one appetizer that does not get enough credit. these wings were tossed with an apple bbq sauce. not a lot of spice but some darn good flavor. the meat lulled right off the bone with little resistance. definitely a must try app.  the rest of the food looks amazing so i guess more trips and more pictures are in order. the atmosphere is laid back and fun. get to know your server and you will have a great time. too many times a place opens and they have to weed out the bad staff. this establishment seems to have done that before opening their doors as i received a smile and hello from every employee that walked by.  one last note.  ask for allen as your server. hes one of the great ones.
stopped in for the grand opening to sample the crack fries and peruse the awesome beer list. the crack fries are delish covered in black pepper and salt and served with a smooth cheese sauce. i tried the fuel cafe on tap. if you like coffee and beer, youll like this one.my husband and i were pleasantly surprised when a manager approached us to give us a promotional card for free crack fries every week for a year. we had heard they were giving these out, but it was our anniversary and we didnt want to wait in the long line.  we couldnt stop laughing after we ended up with a card after all, 3 hours after they opened.  thanks for the great time! one last note i recommend sitting upstairs. there is a beautiful view of the capitol building.
the beer selection was amazing!  well over 100 tap beers to pick from. we also had the crack fries, and my oh my, they were unbelievable! it just opened and the staff was learning the beers. great experience.
great addition to the madison scene ... 130 beers on tap and lots of them are local.  they have an array of styles and they do a great job with description, abv, and barware including shapeoz.   the selection is fantastic and the food was a pleasant surprise.   for bar fare apps, burgers, sandwiches, there were plenty of vegetarian options and the super mega crack tots where ... well ... dope!    our servers kyle and jesi were on top of their game too.   looking forward to coming back soon.   so many beers, so little time.  great atmosphere and location too
good food and good beer!they have so many choices and it takes quite a while to decide on what you want. but the staff are very kind to give recommendations.
met up with some old friends and we were looking for a place to get drinks and dinner.  been wanting to check this place out anyway, so it was a good match!ended up there during happy hour, which was great.  3 local beers, 3 rail drinks, 3 wines and 12 off burgers.  the waiter was very knowledgeable about the beers and recommended options to us when we werent sure where to go.  he also checked in on us often, but wasnt overbearing. i got the fish and crack fries for my dinner.  definitely recommend.  the crack fries are delicious that cracked black pepper adds a lot of flavor.  the fish was fried well, but it was a little soggy, perhaps could have been dried off a bit better from the grease.  the dipping sauce was some type of mustard that paired well with the fish and fries.  also, it came with a lot of fries for just a side to a meal, so i was pleased with that.my friends both got the mac n cheese customizable! and both really enjoyed it.  portion was large enough that they both took home some for lunch the next day.overall, definitely coming back.  wish they had outdoor seating though!
this is the kind of bar that i just really love. they pay homage to the great brews of wisconsin, the food is hella good, and the service is spot on.dont be scared off by the fact that this is technically a state street bar, the feel inside is totally different. the feel of this place is certainly more upscale. i really love the booths and tables they used, very comfortable and classy. the food was decadent. the husband and bro in law both had ginormous burgers and i had a southwest salad with crack tots. i was a lil confused by the tots at first, because they are shaped like mozzarella sticks, i was considered they wouldnt have cooked well that way. i was mistaken though and they were perfectly crisp, just like i want my tots to taste.the beer...oh the heavenly beer. there really is something for everyone. i myself venture toward the sweet side and found a local madison cherry mead on tap as well as a raspberry kombucha beer that was outta sight. really impressed by the variety!lastly, the service couldnt have been better. our waiter was attentive, and everything came out to us in a timely manner.this will definitely be my go to bar when im downtown!
this place is great! ive been to the one in grand rapids so to see one open here in madison was so exciting! 130 taps! my husband waited in line and was 63 to get a free order of crack fries a week for a year! there is something for everyone on both beer and food menu. the staff is very friendly and the decor is well thought out and madisoncentric is that even a word?!located near an essential parking lot... since its practically on the busy state street.  no reason or excuse should keep you and the family from stopping in to enjoy a nice relaxed atmosphere. cheers!
the crack fries are for real! will be thinking about those for a while.amazing selection of beer with a list that is well curated. love the ambiance, especially in the upper level!
great selection of taps, and a great way to cede tea as well.  service was super friendly and attentive without being overly attentive.  bartender who helped us was amazing!
my wife researched this place for my birthday and did a great job. their selection of beers was excellent, and the first thing they do when you sit at the bar is furnish a menu of beers with all the prices, sorted by style. they have a local 30, which changes frequently, but a lot more than 30 local brews  and even some from true micros like hop haus is verona. their menus are so up to date they print them twice a week and put stamps on them during each day when the upcoming list fills out or they run out with a cute no beer for you stamp.the bar is very social  its long and wraps around tge taps  but is not blocked by them, so you can see pretty much everyone there. the bartenders were very social, too, especially jesi, who took care of us like she was hosting us at a party. she would walk by, scanning the area like a lifeguard and then stop and chat whenever we wanted, answering every question thoughtfully, whether it was about the beer, the yummy crack fries which she recommended we not have plain, the packers or her day job. they always had plenty to do but had enough people not to be over busy. wonderful experience overall. was there good food? probably. but we didnt care. there were a ton of tables and theres a wait on weekend nights, so im sure it was good. but thats not what we came for, nor should it have been.
we were actually really glad that we didnt find hopcat until the last day of our madison trip, as im pretty sure it would have been the only place we went. this way, we still got to enjoy the amazingness that it is, while experiencing other restaurants as well. the service was decent, nothing really to write home about. but! next time we will make sure we are there for happy hour 26, mf, which looked like an awesome deal.first, the beer list. im sure everyone has mentioned it in as many reviews as they have. so many beers. mostly local. always rotating. so many types and breweries and lions and tigers and bears, oh my!second, the fries. i was skeptical i mean, theyre fries, and the hubs isnt even a fan of fries. so when the called them crack fries, i set myself up to be disappointed. i was not. plus, they bring them out with a delectably creamy cheese sauce. if there isnt crack in them, im legitimately surprised. my advice would be to get the ones that dont come with stuff on them already. part of the joy of these fries is their delightful crispiness, and i would hate to ruin that by making them soggy.our second appetizer arrived because two people definitely need to eat two appetizers, and it somehow met and exceeded our lofty expectations after the fries. fried pretzel balls. gooey cheese sauce. bacon. jalapenos. onions. no, that is not a list of the foods i could survive on. thats reality. that is the loaded pretzel nuggz.finishing off the night, we ordered the blt and the chicken wings. both were awesome there could have been a tiny bit more wing sauce and it could have used a little bit more of a kick. but honestly, i could just go and eat appetizers all day. next on the list to try? pizza wontons. yeah, you read that right.
been here twice in the same weekend now! the loaded crack fries and vladimir poutine are phenomenal, so was the bar zee burger. the beer selection was different two days later, and had an incredible variety. both of our waiters were tremendously charismatic, and they eve split our burger for us! :new favorite in madison, will be coming back every chance i get!
wow 130 micro brews on tap. had a great atmosphere and tremendous service. we found bartender to be very helpful recommending what we might like based on our old favorites.  food was good,  crack fries amazing. but really for me the beer tasting and variety is the true draw.  we cant wait for punkin ale season!
great food and great beer. the buffalo egg roles are actually spicy which is great! thanks emily, you were great and we will be back again.
stopped here on game day for lunch. wasnt too crowded  plenty of room! they have 130 different tap beers! i ordered their burger with the hot dogcheeseonion rings  it was delicious i think it was called the monster burger. the burger included their famous crack fries. the crack fries were actually really good, i was afraid they might be super salty but they werent.
allen is the best waiter! personable and awesome! ; will be back to try more food and beers  crack fries and muffin top burger rocked my word! love the atmosphere! ;
one of my new favorite places in madison! excellent food, really great atmosphere, friendly staff, 130 different beers and crack frieswhat more do you need? i highly recommend the madtown grilled cheese.
great beer and wonderful service even on badger saturday.
stopped in for a beer and a bite while downtown around 2pm on a wednesday . bartender was personable and knowledgeable. very few customers so it was quiet. beer choices were many and well thought. we enjoyed ourselves.
crack fries. nothing else matters about this place. if you are into beer, they have a huge selection. atmosphere is fun too. but seriously just go for the crack fries.
i have this thing about overhyped places...i lose interest. so even though i initially was looking forward to hopcat...hypecat... opening, i decided to wait until the masses were on to the next new thing. when i found myself downtown today, i popped in to check it out. what the heck...? ok. so this place does everything right. ambiance? clean, well decorated and the perfect lighting and music levels and every single song played was a favorite, during my entire visit. a singing waiter, who sang the whole time i was there and thankfully in a good voice is a clue that the staff enjoys being there. that sounds like it could be annoying, but it really wasnt. the downstairs bar is a huge ushaped affair, and there was only one bartender working when i stopped in, but he handled everything well on his own. calm, friendly, knowledgeable, and just attentive enough. adam is a pro. i inquired about half pours of beers, and that indeed was an option. i tried two beers that were new to me, one of which adam recommended, and it was much better than the one i picked on my own. both were very good, though.i had intended to only grab an order of the muchlauded crack fries for lunch, but then adam informed me that all the temptingsounding burgers were half price. im not sure what the hours or days of that special are, but i was there around 3:30 pm on a thursday. i rarely ever order burgers, but id been in the mood for an old favorite, a blue cheese and mushroom burger. when i saw that was one of their special burgers, i couldnt resist. im gonna tell you guys, it was fantastic. it came with lettuce, tomato, swiss, and shoestring fried onions in addition to the mushrooms and blue cheese mayo. it was cooked exactly medium, just as ordered. it was a bit of a mess to eat, but they bring you plenty of napkins when its delivered to your table. or the bar, as it were. as i were...sitting at the bar. crack fries are all they are hyped to be. addictive. everything was all i could want it to be. corporate entity, yes, but you kind of forget all that once you fall under their spell of perfectly executed everything.two half pourbeers and a huge platter of delicious food came to twelve dollars and change. amazing. i am a fan for life.
crack fries are as amazing as everyone says they are! the beer selection is almost overwhelming and the burgers are hugeeeee!come hungry!
i didnt expect to like this place so much! i was originally turned off by the huge, collegey chain on state street. however, the food is spectacular, the service is fabulous and the place is roomy and attractive. everything ive tried tastes great. the crack fries are obviously great. the buffalo rolls are amazing. if you think hopcat only serves good unhealthy food, think again. the southwest salad is delicious and fills you up.servers are always friendly and helpful. when it took more than a few minutes to get us our appetizers, they asked what they could comp because they felt so bad. we didnt even think wed been waiting that long!
this place is fantastic.  the beer selection is second to none, great atmosphere, very friendly service.  the crack fries and the sauce they serve them with is unbelievable.  i cant wait to bring some out of town friends and family here when i get the chance.
excellent place to come after a long day at work. place was hopping midweek which typically says it must be good.... and it was!! good service and even better food.will go back to try other eats.
omg, awesome food, cool ass vibe. the rumors are truethese are the best fries youve ever had! highly recommend
was more than pleasantly surprised! im not a beer person, so i was hesitant when a friend suggested meeting up here. they have an extensive food selection and the staff was happy to sub things when needed! i worked as a bartender before and i was still pretty amazed at how knowledgable the staff is about their huge beer selection. one even found one that i liked for me! the mac n cheese was amazing and a very large portion! i would recommend going! wish they had a few more options though for those who do not like beer, but it was still a wonderful dining experience with quick, amazing service!
this place was great!! we went here for my bachelorette to start off festivities. very classy, great selection of beers. great feel. they were a little over the top asking for ids however. asked at the door, at the bar and at the table... i got carded 3 times. i think they are going for a little older crowd.... not old, just older young adults. so 25 yrs and up. loved it though. so stinkin awesome and near everything! great location! great selection! great service! great atmosphere! great time!
la petite mort is ideal for date night in edinburgh. the prices are reasonable, the space is inviting, and the staff are friendly and really know their stuff. the food is delicious: fine dining at a reasonable price. there are only three starters, five mains, and three desserts to choose from but i still found it difficult to settle on what to eat. everything sounds so good! the drinks menu is similarly well put together with some lovely sounding cocktails and loads of great bottles of wine.
as part of a surprise birthday dinner we were indeed pleasantly surprised to be seated at la petit mort. there was a really warm welcome and we were very well taken care of. the girl serving us was extremely knowledgeable and could explain drinks and dishes to the finest detail, including little enticing morsels of flavour explanations. they serve a menu of 3 starter, mains and desserts. the highlight for myself was indeed the rare cooked flat iron steak. perfectly cooked and extremely tender. their cocktail list is a joy to read.they do offer a large range of classic cocktails made to measure and personal preferences. i was very pleased with my earl grey old fashioned though i personally prefer the single large rock of icemy biggest surprise was how reasonable the prices are compared to other places of similar quality kitchin, scan  scally et al the food and service is certainly up to par. sure these other places have won awards, but i did experience a similar if not better experience in la petit mort  and as they are just starting out they may collect their rewards later on. highly recommended and certainly worthy of revisiting often.
love the vegan flavor options and all organic toppings. cant wait to go back and get more coconut!! and try all of the others!
i really do love the whole concept of these froyo places.  its fun to pick your flavors and toppings.  as an added bonus  the yogurt at picadilly is made with better ingredients.  i dont go here because its organic, but since it is, it makes me feel better about eating a giant bowl of dessert!  the yogurt is really good, the store is well kept, and the staff is friendly.  ill keep going back.
the vanilla bean froyo was amazing, and we got 3 generous servings myself, husband, and mil for under 10  very, very reasonable price for an awesome product and a beautiful space.  strongly recommended.
i was so excited to learn that piccadilly was coming to pittsburgh! i went to the piccadilly creamery in cleveland and loved it! it turns out this is an independently owned store, but under the same umbrella as piccadilly in cleveland. the decor is very similar and so cute! its actually how i first noticed it while i was driving down washington road. it looked just like the cleveland shop and then i noticed the name!! i love the pittsburgh skyline made from distressed wood. so clever! the signage, tableschairs, and photo booth make this a quirky, cute shop that really fits into 2015! its like every inch of this place was made to be snapped and posted to instagram. speaking of that, i wish they had a better presence on social media. i worry that places like this will fail without a strong social media presence in this day and age. and i dont want it to fail!! the yogurt is so good! the first time here i tried the pomegranate made from the actual fruit! with some vanilla. i topped it with fresh fruit, granola and...nutella! the second time i tried the salted caramel with cheesecake bites, brownies and more nutella! my toppings might not have been the healthiest choice, but its on yogurt so i justified it! there are so many good choices for the yogurt even vegan options using coconut milk and for the toppings. the first time here i spoke with the owners son and then the owner. both were really nice and i loved that they said if this store is successful they want to open an actual creamery. the one in cleveland uses liquid nitrogen to make the ice cream to order! i hope they can bring that to the burgh! i think it would be so successful in lawrenceville! ill be back again and again and again! hey its organic yogurt!
im a big fan of this wonderful little froyo shop, not only because the yogurt is better than average, but because the offerings are healthier than most. you can go with the usual dairy based froyo, but they also offer a dairy free frozen product made with coconut milk thats delicious. for their dairy yogurts, they are sourcing local milk from cows that arent given bovine growth hormone, and i really appreciate that. the staff is knowledgable and helpful, and seem to truly enjoy talking about the product and the store. this is a welcome addition to this stretch of liberty rd., which has a lot of local and interesting businesses.
fantastic.  really. not your typical yoghurt place.  the yoghurt is smooth, tasty, and not too sweet but sweet enough!. all great ingredients including organic and grass fed milk for the nonvegan options.  the local tart flavor was superb; paired it with the pumpkin, which was also perfect just the right amount of spices and not overwhelming.
we stumbled upon this vegan cat cafe rather serendipitously. the baristas speak both french and english, and are warm and attentive.  we ordered a drip coffee, chai latte, chocolate chip cookie, and quicheall of which were unbelievably delicious and extremely affordable. theres free wifi, and comfortable seating throughout. you can come alone or with a group to the cafe.prices are extremely affordable and great quality. the cats are, naturally, adorable and friendly.whats more about this cat cafe beyond its vegan menu is that the cats are all available to be adopted. i wanted to take one home to toronto! even if youre not vegan and looking for a great cafe, i highly recommend this place. the food is delicious, the service is great, and the cats are fantastic.
cats. coffee. cute everything. hell yeah.so this was my first visit to a cat cafe in general, and i definitely wasnt disappointed.the whole establishment is vegan which frankly makes a lot of sense to me given the fact that were all animal lovers here why do the other cat cafes not have more vegan stuff??. we just grabbed inexpensive iced coffees but ill definitely be back to try other stuff.in terms of space and atmosphere, it was perfect theres a cozy inclosed patio space with twinkle lights where the cats seem particularly happy. the inside of the cafe is adorable with lots of saturatedcolour item furniture; great artwork; lots of cat paraphernalia; and soft, ephemeral tunes playing.the only down side was maybe that there were only four cats in the whole establishment and theyre clearly very used to a lot of affection from patrons. needless to say, for the most part the kitties were not interested in hanging out with us. i reckon this is probably a regular thing for cat cafes. they were still fun to look at though! oh, and all of the cats are available for adoption!
this was my very first cat cafe experience and was i pleasantly surprised how much i love this place that weve been back here every morning.  the place is clean, the staff and cats are all very friendly and welcoming, and the best part is they have a little kitten!!!   they have a large amount of board games, very comfortable seating, front and back patio.  the decor in this place is beautiful. food wise they serve vegan food which is a pleasant change after a weekend indulgence of massive poutine. many options for drinks: anything from filtered coffee, espressos, matcha lattes, to espresso milkshakes!if you are visiting montreal, you definitely will be walking down st denis you must stop by this place.
i definitely recommend this cafe i wish they opened one up in toronto! i enjoyed my experience here so much i came here two days in a row during my weekend visit. the staff were so friendly and helpful. the cats were so friendly as well. theres this one kitten that stole my heart cosmo. the ambient is hip cool modern and comfortable. the cafe is clean and i smelled no trace of kitty litter or stench even though there were at least 6 cats which were all so well behaved. you can adopt them too  im a huge supporter of animal adoption. they have vegan food and their prices are extremely reasonable. coffees range from24.75 desserts 2.254.75, sandwiches soups salads from 3.758 which is cheaper than other food along st.denis. i recommend this cafe and would definitely come back!!
ok. i did not know this type of cafe existed in north america. my friend and i were looking for a place to get work done in montreal when we stumbled across this cafe. with a giant cat symbol on the window, i thought it was only cat themed. but then i saw a live cat resting by the window, and that was the end of my search for a cafe. walking inside, it was perfect. the large tables for work, free wifi, cute ambience, availability of food and snacks, and 45 cats, some kittens. smitten with kittens. they have some little toys and stairs for these little critters as well as feeding time, where they let the guests give the cats some snacks. i have to say that i probably could have gotten more work done, but who cares when there are kittens around. they are really friendly, and where my cat would probably claw you to death for a belly rub, the ones here are decidedly docile. as for the food, its a vegan place, meaning you get a choice of soy or almond milk to go with your coffee. the coffee itself was ok. the flat white was excellent. the tempeh wrap was decent i originally wanted the quiche, but they were out. the parfait and caprese sandwich were also great.its a great and unique experience. 5stars!
this place is 1000 vegan and so delicious! all the sandwiches are worth trying  dont miss the potato salad. they have great selections of coffee drinks  you must try the toasted marshmallow italian soda! so fun to be surrounded by the cute kitties, which are all up for adoption!
aujourdhui il fait gris et il pleut. quoi de mieux pour se rechauffer et se remonter le moral que daller boire un thecafechocolat chaud au cafe venosa !le cafe est joli et chaleureux. on est accueillis par plusieurs chats super cute et par une equipe tres sympa.rien quen arrivant on sait quon passer un moment calme et detendu ici.cest vegetarien ici, et cest tres bon ! jai goute la brioche aux amandes, vraiment top !possibilite de caresser les chats, de jouer a des jeux de societe. super spot aussi pour venir passer lapresmidi a bosser avec son ordi ou pour lire un bon bouqin, cest calme et agreable.
what a lovely cat cafe! my 4 yearold and i had such a wonderful visit here last week. my daughter just asked me this morning when we can return for another cupcake, cocoa and most of all, to play with the cats. and unlike some of the other cat cafes in montreal, supervised children are welcome at cafe venosa. the owner is a doll. i am not sure how she vets her cats, but all of the cats are so friendly and outgoing. we could have stayed all day. we will certainly be back very soon.
simply amazing!!have an excellent soy hot chocolate or vegan cupcakes surrounded by lovely and open for adoption cats.staff is fantastic as wellan experience!
my husband and i recently relocated to the area and were told about premium cabinets through close friends. spoke with the owner and had a great experience. not only was he professional, but he kept us in the loop the entire way, and was very accommodating. we couldnt be happier with the service or the end result. if you shop around as much as i do, include them in your list of companies to call! 5 stars all the way!
this is a long one, get your reading glasses!we have several apartment buildings in the gilbert and surrounding phoenix areas. when it was time to upgrade one of our buildings we had to really watch our budget since there were 7 units to remodel. we shopped around at the regular big box stores and a few specialty kitchen and bath stores when we stumbled across premium cabinets and david. not to be mistaken for premium wholesale cabinets see my review of them on their page. david is new to the cabinet business, but that didnt turn us off, in fact we felt he was eager to learn and help us understand about anything we werent clear about. he has a really great support system with other dealers around the country, and we thank ray in montana for his efforts helping us as well. once we were comfortable with the product wed chosen, which was really great quality btw, we gave david our floor plan for each unit. 3 units were unique, and 4 units had the same layout. its a good thing david came out to our units to do a final measure though. what we thought were 4 of the same units turned out to have subtle differences that if you hadnt put a tape measure on it youd think it was the same. it wasnt. thankfully david was aware that though they looked the same, builders often fudge walls and make on site changes to work around issues in original plans. if he hadnt come to do that we would have had at least a dozen cabinets that would not have fit, and that would have killed our budget. our cabinet budget for this job was 25,000 not including labor. just cabinets and hardware. every single place we shopped priced us well over our budget, some more than double what we planned. premium came in at a surprising 22,222 which was not only below budget, but a number we wont soon forget! order time was very reasonable and our cabinets arrived in about 4 weeks. definitely on the quicker end of our experiences with other cabinet shops where 68 weeks was standard. there was one broken cabinet in the shipment, but david informed us, and quickly got a replacement on his next shipment. heres where ray from montana came back into the scene. david refersuses ray, another premium cabinets dealer who is also a contractor, to install cabinets. ray is always working this area and the reason  davids got started and set up the location here in gilbert. you get to know these people pretty well on projects this big. ray was able to install all of the cabinets for us in just over 2 weeks, about 2 days per unit, and took care of some of the hidden issues behind the old cabinets we didnt know about till we took them out. that probably added 23 days to the installation time. when all was said and done we saved more money and dealt with less heartache dealing with these guys than any other trade we used in our building. all in all our experience with the guys at premium cabinets was wonderful. we have 7 really great looking units that we know tenant will be proud to come home to. its rare these days to find businesses that truly care about the outcome of your project and arent just there for a sale. we have other buildings in the phoenix area and when we update the next vacant units theres no doubt where well make our cabinet purchase. thank you david, and ray, for a truly wonderful cabinet and construction experience. you deserve success for treating customers so well. cheers!oh yeah, pictures added for your visual pleasure!
i called and had a question about something related to cabinets, and david pointed me in the right direction to resolve the issue on my own, rather than telling me i should pay him to take care of the issue. that shows a lot of integrity.
the food, the service  the ambiance! this place is a must try. went for early dinner with a girl friend. we started off with oysters. very fresh. we tried the crudity with dip. light but something to snack on as we were so hungry but the food came fast. our waiter suggested some drinks from the cocktails. they bring you bread you can choose from with amazing soft butter. i had the aaa new york steak with market vegetables, wild mushrooms and pont neuf potatoes. the meat was cooked to perfection. the jus on top was amazing with the thick potatoes. we had the smores for dessert. great meal. they have valet parking.
i miss this incredible coffee joint terribly! best coffee in montreal! such a gem in such a vibrant city!
wow, i cant believe this place exists!!  poutine?  where have you been all my life!  i was told about this place opening up a month ago and have been patiently waiting to try it.  i had the pork 3 ways.  its a box full of very tasty french fries, chunks of melted cheese with brown gravy then topped with tender pulled pork, bacon and ham.  the large is a little too much for one setting.  no biggie,  ive been snacking on it all day.  its simply an amazing melody of deliciousness.  i look forward to trying the other poutine meals.i only yelp when im impressed.  us fries, you get my 5 stars.  see you again real soon!!!
i went there on the opening day! the environment was very welcoming and i also like the music they played. it was the first time i tried poutine. i tried the chili corn poutine which was really tasty!!! will definitely go back soon to try their eegees, which they didnt have at the time.
i had seen the sign  store front when driving downtown on friday, decided to drop in on saturday, we didnt know that it was their grand opening  what a phenomenal concept. poutine is excellent, great environment  remarkable prices and options. open one in gilbert!
coming from a fatburger fan i have to say i am more than happy to welcome usf to fatburgers former location. i recently had us fries in tucson and thought it was amazing then. i went on free poutine day and was a little sad that i couldnt have beef and crispy onions, they had cheeseburger and traditional poutine only, i talked to the owner and he said that logistically these were the fastest to make and easiest to expedite to the masses. i probably would have never tried the cheeseburger poutine but i was glad i did. i loved it, asked for extra pickles and they obliged and added a little hot sauce. the cheese curds were melting everything together, my mouth is watering as i type. the place has some great atmosphere, two levels of seating and these crazy 10ft woodgrain high tables, not sure i have ever seen anything like it. i went back today for lunch to be reunited with the beef and crispy onion and it feels so good. i see trouble with a poutine addiction in my future.
i lived in canada for over 20 years, hearing that i was finally going to get some poutine again after over 5 years i was excited to try this place.  they did not disappoint!!i got the traditional for my first try of this place.  i had to make sure they had the right stuff before i ventured onto their other creations.  the fries were cooked to perfection for poutine.  a little extra crispy so they dont just soak up all the gravy and become soggy.  the brown gravy was full of flavor and the cheese curds were simply great.the only criticism i have, i consider this minor, is that i would have preferred the poutine served on a plate so the fries at the bottom didnt have so much gravy on them.  spread it out a little for all the fries to share.i cant wait to go back and try some other combinations.flavor suggestion: add one with montreal smoked meat!
ive been here a few times now and ive tried a few different options and they have all been delicious. i work on mill, so i was excited to have a new place on the block. every time i have gone has been a great experience, the staff has always been very friendly and the food has always been good. ill definitely be back.
im giving it a 5 star not because the food was great but because they were good at service! the food was ok we got philly fries and the gravey wasnt very good in my personal opinion and the wisconsin cheese curds tasted good but they arent like the fried curds you get at the fairs in wisconsin. price was a little high although there is a lot into it i just couldnt justify going back again. but overall i would give it a 710 on the food scale but i wont rate bad on yelp because it affects it so much!
first time having poutine fries  we ordered the philly cheese steak... and it was so good that we finished it in a breath! the people working here are very friendly and helpful! amazing customer service  specifically fisher and brandon! my dad wanted some lemon for his tea, and fisher was just talking to us about eegees, so he brought over a lemon eegees on the house! incredible! it tastes so fresh too! thank you guys!
i seriously cannot stop coming here. ive already lost track of how many times ive visited in the few short of weeks that theyve been open. the food is so good! the classic poutine is fantastic and all the tasty variations are wonderful. i seriously dream of their food. you need to do yourself the favor and stop by.p.s. if the owner sees this, your employees should have a tip jar. they work very hard and i greatly appreciate the service. in my last few visits, ive tried to slip them a little bit here and there.
we decided to try this place after i heard they were opening up on mill avenue. they had a free poutine day so we decided to try it out.the owner is extremely friendly and is very personable. he loves to hear suggestions as well as compliments of course. i ordered the cheeseburger poutine and my fiance chose the regular poutine.ive tried poutine before but have not had it meet my expectations until now. the cheeseburger poutine was an interesting blend of flavors and it was delicious. though the regular poutine was perfect. the cheese had the squeaky aspect and the gravy was the perfect consistency. overall it all blended perfectly and not a single bite was left. it was filling and definitely worth it. the prices arent so bad and the hours are great if you go drinking during the weekend on mill. so check this place out. parking is a little hard so i would try to park near fuzzys if possible which is metered parking by the way.so if you want a piece of canada, check out u.s. fries.
the poutine here at us fries reminded me of back home! best poutine ive had in a long time! jay helped us out great place is sweet check it out!
i decided to try out us fries today. poutines? what? it is a canadian dish of fries, gravy, and cheese curds. i ordered the large pot roast poutine for about 11. relativity expensive, but did leave me satisfied and full. the food is great, new, and definitely something coming back to. staff is top notch. my only remark is that the amount of gravy can be excessive.regardless, i got a taste of canada, and it was pretty damn good.
coming from canada, and now living in the u.s. , there are some things that i miss; poutine is one of them. u.s. fries poutine is like a little taste from home. its one of the best poutines i have had in a long time! the restaurant itself is very fun, modern and clean. i highly recommend it to all.
tried the pork three way poutine regular size. heavenly, and plenty of good food to fill up a big guy with a good appetite. ham, pulled pork, and bacon on top of fries, melty cheese curds and gravy. ill be back and ill bring my amigos.
2 words. so. bomb.ive never had poutine before. but ive definitely had each of the ingredients separately.i got a regular serving of traditional poutine.it was extremely good. my coworker had the cheesburger poutine and weve already discussed going back next week.worth it!
finally... real poutine in az!!!!!! i tried poutine in canada and fell in love with it but havent had authentic, delicious poutine since coming back to az. food is great, service was fast and friendly and the place is really, really cool inside. big fan... ill be back!
fried cheese curds are delicious and rare burgers are wisconsin style. stop in tempe for some authentic wisconsin food
so amazing. i thought about ordering philly cheesesteak without gravy but that wouldve been a major mistake. i added sauteed mushrooms and it was delicious. i got the large, took half home and ate it all the next day and it was still good. their cheese curds are to die for also. and the service was wonderful. love it!!
had the pulled pork this time. out of this world!  had their coffee too. amazing!!!!such a nice new and different change from the typical norm. staff was super nice too.
had the pulled pork this time. out of this world!  had their coffee too. amazing!!!!such a nice new and different change from the typical norm. staff was super nice too.
delicious crispy fries if you havent tried the philly cheesesteak pourine definately try  it delicious
went to this place on halloween, and they were packed. in fact they serve great drunk food. dont walk in expecting burgers because you wont find it. its a fries joint, they have fries served with whatever you want right on top. the standard is just fries smothered in cheese curds and brown gravy. next time i go back ill get some meat on my fries in addition to the cheese curds.
as a lover of poutine, i enjoy it whenever i get the chance im a southern californian and not many poutine restaurants in my area. in the afternoon traveling through phoenix i saw this place on a groupon deal, decided to give it a try, and was not dissapointed !! they have just about their whole menu dedicated to poutine, and the welcoming staff are there to help. the atmosphere is very modern and clean, nicely settled in the town of tempe. oh, and did i mention that the portions are huge? great prices, friendly staff, cool atmosphere, and yummy food!
my wife and i recently stopped by after hearing from friends how good this place was. so glad we did! i had the cheeseburger poutine with added bacon and it was terrific. my wife had the dixie rae  bbq pork sandwich and she enjoyed that as well. the cole slaw that was served on the sandwich was very flavorful. the ciabatta bun was also a nice touch.very tasty food, friendly staff they even refilled my drink for me and nice casual ambiance. big screen tvs with sports playing. well be back with the kids for eegees!
pulled pork and bacon on fries.  enough said.  this place is no frills and simple.  the food is good and filing.  service was excellent.  the guys catered to special orders and even threw in some cold slaw.  this was a great place to take the family.
super friendly, super good food, and just an awesome place to eat. the inside looks incredible and the food is absolutely delicious. keep up the good work:
gray variety of poutine and toppings like philly cheese steak and pulled pork.  vegetarian options.  good quality gravy and cheese.  do it!
very enjoyable poutine! i got the traditional to share and my husband tried the pork three ways. all very yummy and angel who was working was very nice and friendly. im canadian and its nice to have a legit poutine place in az!
this was our first time eating here. it was delicious!! comfort food at its best!! good portions with plenty of toppings. i loved that i was not left with just plain fries at the end. not only was the food excellent but the server michael,i think was so enthusiastic about his job, the food and was very friendly, he made you feel very welcome. he mentioned that everything was cooked on site and made fresh. you can certainly tell. definitely going to be going back for more!!!
tried this brand new counter burger this week and wow...what a great burger. had the chili fries and they were terrific. top it off with a delicious shake and what a meal and the portions are large. i realize they just opened and service was little slower but lets give the staff a break, it will get better. the patio is extremely large and a great place for a after work cocktail. have to try that next. all in all this is a great location with food that will keep you coming back.
i tried this new place out today and as a downtown resident i think it brings something new to the area where you can enjoy good beer none of that miller and bud light nonsense and great burgers! you can even make the burgers healthier by choosing different buns, protein, sauces, veggies.. etc. you can even choose the bowl option instead of the bun. love that they are open until 9pm. the staff was very friendly and helpful.
read about this place in todays az republic and must say we were impressed.  great customer service by our server broklin, who gave us a nice overview of the menu and did a nice job of checking in on us after the food arrived. i got the beef burger my wife got the veggie burger and we were both very happy.  the beef was delicious and the turkey chili was also excellent.  the  bloody mary would have been better served in a pint glass than the tall shot glass it is served in.  beer selection was excellent and we will be going back for another trip soon.  next time im going after the adult shakes they have on their menu.  great place and well worth it!!!
just three little girls roaming around downtown phoenix working on a photoshoot and we stumbled upon this place after walking in the heat for 20 minutes trying to find a place to eat. best decision ever. a great location and a great find in our dire situation. the staff was pleasant and the food was great. its our newest food spot in phoenix.
the menu has amazing options and the food was incredible! all the appetizers that we ordered were delicious and perfectly cooked. i recommend getting the fried pickles and the fried onion stringsthose were phenomenal! i ordered a burger that was delicious and perfectly cooked, even the bun was awesome! we ordered milkshakes too and they tasted amazing. our server isaiah did a fantastic job! he was very nice, professional, and attentive. even a manager came by to check on us and asked if we were satisfied. i highly recommend this place!
just stopped back here and had the ahi tuna burger that was fantastic!  by far the best tuna burger ive ever had. cant recommend this place enough.
what a fun place to bring the whole family downtown. you get to create your own custom burgers. service is very friendly and the resturants is very clean. they offer gluten free buns. we will be back.
walk into the counter in downtown phoenix, and youll immediately feel welcomed. the restaurant has an upscale diner feel, with a sports televisionfilled bar, comfy booths and lots of tables for both oneonone encounters and family outings. i loved the lighting, which was just right at nottoobright, nottoodim, and despite the construction currently surrounding the restaurants streets, its nice to have a downtown phoenix view while you nosh.my pal and i recently dined there and tried a ton of menu items, a great variety for both fans of the buildyourownburger concept, as well as vegans and vegetarians. we started with fried dill pickle chips 5, which came with a sweet apricot sauce. i liked the sweet and salty combination, and the pickles were fried to a great consistency, light and not greasy.we also split a big caprese salad 7.50, which came with marinated red and green tomatoes, red onion and thick slices of mozzarella. these two items alone would have filled us both up. i loved the green tomatoes, which is a unique touch to the tomatoes you usually get in a caprese salad.the build your own burger process is the really fun part. grab a sheet of paper outlining all your burger options, and fill it out, sushistyle. theres a housemade vegan option, as well as bison, turkey, chicken and tuna burgers. get it with a bun options include a vegan ciabatta and pretzel bun, or go bowlstyle and forgo carbs. there are a dozen cheeses to choose from, 26 sauces to add, and nearly 50 toppings to pile on, including dried cranberries, quinoa and marinated artichokes. premium toppings include an egg, bacon and chili. add a side for 3, from shoestring or sweet potato fries, to seasonal grilled corn, and youve got a very filling meal  i couldnt finish a quarter of my burger and crispy onion strings combo after the appetizers.for my burger, i ordered the vegan patty on a vegan ciabatta bun, with herbed goat cheese spread, house mustard, a lettuce blend, alfalfa sprouts, tomatoes, red onion and dill pickles. although i added a ton to my burger, everything was portioned wellenough so i could hold it without a problem and cut it in half cleanly. the vegan patty was delicious, and id highly recommend my flavor combination if youre looking for a great veggie option. if youre vegan, there is also a vegan cheddar, which really made me appreciate how well the counter is mindful of all its customers.you can also build your own salad, or order a burger on their menu in a combination the restaurant has concocted. besides a full bar, one of the other cool aspects to the counter is that you can order an adult shake, a sweet treat with your choice of spirit or liqueur.besides the tasty food and welcoming ambiance, my pal and i thought our service was stellar, especially considering all the things we ordered. we received everything promptly and were checked on diligently, which we were really thankful for.
in phoenix for a trade show and this restaurant was a quick walk from hotel.. sorry folks 105 is just damn hot...being an east coaster was thinking this was a local version of 5guys... my tastebuds are immensely happy i was oh so wrong... not sure how this place is not a 5 star... but all i can say is bison burger, grilled veggies, shoestring fries... boom .. walk away full and with your tongue wanting to know when ur coming back....winter i keep telling it.. definitely winter. or if ur old skool....two thumbs up with a twist in z formation.
i was staying across the street at the renaissance hotel for one night, and i was looking for someplace close by to eat. its tough to be closer than the counter, so i gave it a shot.the food was excellent. they have this massive menu of options for building a burger, including gluten free buns or a nobun burger bowl option which i selected. pick a meat, a cheese, unlimited cool toppings i went with things like jicama, grilled onions, cucumbers, pickles and jalapenos and a sauce. i also added a side of sweet potato fries. both the burger bowl and the fries were very tasty. after eating, i decided to have an adult milkshake. again, you can pick one of their options or build your own, so i went with chocolate sauce, peanut butter and chocolate chips with kahlua good choices, me!. i appreciated that i could get a notsohuge 12 ounce shake, too 16 ounces would have been more than i needed, though it was an option.i sat at the bar, in part so i could watch a football game, and the bartender  server was super friendly and helpful the whole time. keep in mind that i was there at 5:30 on a thursday, so it wasnt crowded at all, but still, their service was great.big thumbs up from me! burgers and boozy shakes... yum.
today, i ate the most amazing burger in the history of burgers, a burger that any cow would be glad to contribute to. this is not a budget burger  for the under 10 dinner, im still all about the smashburger  but its a burger worth budgeting for.my original reasoning was that the counter is in a really handsome historic building, one thats fascinated me for years. i figured custom built burger would be like fuddruckers. no. no. it is like fuddruckers only in the sense that a luxury golf course is like a sparse patch of front lawn or saks is like jc penney.first and most important, the counter tackles the concept of custom with fervor. your burger can be beef, chicken, tuna, veggieveggie, and i think a couple of things i forgot. you can have it on a bun of several varieties including glutenfree or as a salad. there are sixteen cheese possibilities including a vegan one and twentysix sauces. and thats before you even get to the veggie toppings. if youre innately indecisive, bring some dice to roll for your burgers capabilities. if youre innately geeky, calculate the permutations and make a chart for working your way through them.second, the burger is jawdroppingly excellent. i had beef on a wholegrain bun with nicoise olives and spicy pickles, with some form of italian dressing. the first bite was a revelation. as i got to the last quarter of my burger, i kept delaying because i didnt want it to be over. i like burgers, but i do not ordinarily get this blissedout over a burger.third, there is craft beer. thats almost mandatory in phoenix these days, but itd be a loss if it werent there.fourth, the service is outstandingly charming. i love staff who walk the walk on being so good that youll want to tip generously as i did rather than discriminating based on stereotypical expectations about tipping.fifth, i was so blissedout by the burger that i gave a thumbsup to key lime pie on my waiters suggestion, and it was quite a fine pie. i will now be living on beans and wads of lettuce for the rest of the week, while exercising vigorously, but it was worth it.eat here. bring dice.
the bison burger and sweet potato fries were great, and the staff was kind and courteous.
a great burger spot from california, with many options and sides. perfect for downtown
great place in the middle of downtown phoenix! many menu choices and the adult milkshakes are amazing! i had a simple build your own salad but it was very good and i could tell my chicken was grilled fresh. had great service from the girl behind the bar, didnt catch her name but she had blonde hair. a bit pricy, but you get what you pay for.
definitely a barber shop you need to check out. so glad francisco finally got his own shop. such a great prime location right on roosevelt row. the best barber in arizona! plus who can say no to free beer and a great cut! definitely worth the drive downtown or for anyone in the downtown area!
had a great experience the barber took very good care of me, one of the few places still doing hot towel shaves and facials for men, a true gentlemens experience, they do appointments and walk ins which is always nice, even offered me a complimentary beverage while i waited, which was well need i mean we do live in arizona!
if your looking for great service , great looking shop, and a great barber then you should go here, the big guy with the beard can cut some hair , ive seen a lot of barbers but this guy really is a master barber, they are really friendly and even offered me some water while my husband was getting a haircut, the waiting area is awesome, loved the art. glad to see a real barbershop in downtown phoenix and especially on roosevelt row.
while i was recovering from a recent hack job from another downtown hair establishment, i happened to go check out the newly opened roosevelt barbershop. i must admit that i was a bit hesitant since my last haircut left me traumatized and also due to the fact that i havent let an actual barber touch my hair since my last flatop circa 1996, but i had heard very good things about juniors barber skills. i was very impressed with the haircut that i received and complimentary beer wasnt too bad either! if youre downtown and in need of a cut, check them out. it also doesnt hurt that the shop is in walking distance from the rooseveltcentral light rail stop. junior knows his stuff!
saw this place while driving down roosevelt in downtown phoenix and thought id drop in to check it out. i was not expecting anything close to the quality of cutshave and atmosphere that i experienced. this place is perfect. a small 3 station shop, with skilled guys churning out killer cuts. its a minimalist setup and clean all around. theyve got drinks to make the wait more pleasant, tvs in the lobby and at the stations, and a playlist that, at least on the day i went in, beats the hell out of any barbershop ive been in. the guys know their stuff. i went in for a pretty serious trim and beardstache clean up and it was fairly quick and im not so sure ive ever looked better. the conversation is great, the barbers are charismatic and friendly. im quite happy these dudes have joined my neighborhood. i can honestly say this is my  new go to shop!
every man needs a barbershop where they feel like its an extension of their home. as soon as i entered the shop, the barber came up to me and my wife and greeted us. he literally walked over to us and shook our hands. the owner then offered me a bottle water and soda. immediately i felt welcomed. i asked for a taperfade with a hard combover. he wasnt shy like most these rookie barbers. he made small talk and we were able to shoot the breeze on the nba finals. my haircut was superb. seriously one of the best cuts ive had. following, i decided to get a facial. the owner gave me a wet towel massage that cleared out my pours and made me feel relaxed. i highly recommend any man looking for a classy old school barbershop to check this place out. if you are hungry, you can stop by jimmy johns after. oh yeah, they play old school music in the background.
my husband stumbled on this new barber shop this morning.  since he was in need for a haircut he walked in and was warmly greeted by albert and junior.  he got one of his best haircuts ever by junior.  he said the shop is a great blend of an old school barber shop and contemporary design and they are very customer service oriented  couldnt be nicer!we like supporting local business and roosevelt row.  my husband will now be a regular.congratulations on getting off to a great start!
these guys are the real deal.  this is the way that ive always pictured a barber shop to beclassy dudes doing great cuts.while in town on vacation, i found these guys nearby and booked a hot shave for my boyfriend.  when we arrived a little late they took him right back and got him started.  they offered my bf a cold drink, which was nice after walking from our hotel. and then they offered me one too! beer on tap? awesome. they chatted with my boyfriend and also with me out in the waiting area while i sipped on a cold blue moon.my bf walked out of their shop feeling like a hundred bucks.  he kept feeling his face all day and said his skin felt so good.  he said hed never had that kinda of experience and really wished we lived nearby so he could make that a regular thing for himself.  i know that when were back in phx, well try to get in to roosevelt again!
great atmosphere and service was phenomenal! a nice cold beer on tap while u wait! i made an appointment and got seen in 5mins! jr. was an awesome barber and would recommend to all!
on vacation and wanted a nice clean cut. i walked into the barber shop and was immediately greeted. they asked me multiple times if i was thirsty and wanted something to drink. i opted for the blue moon they serve on tap but they also have water and soda if thats what you like.   i got my haircut from junior and he was great. i told him what i was looking for and he blew my expectations out of the water. his knowledge and skill is beyond a cut and run type of barber. he took his time and explained what and why he was cutting my hair the way he did. i guarantee i will go back and bring as many people as i can with me. its nice to see a barber with a great atmosphere than my many other experiences around here.
ive gotten my hair styled here twice since theyve been open, once by albert and once by junior. i can honestly say, it doesnt matter whos chair you sit in, youll have a great conversation and leave the place feeling great.before coming to roosevelt barbershop i had the same barber for 3 years. i decided to try roosevelt barbershop because the location is much more convenient for me and also because juniors reputation is phenomenal. he was at the shop i used to go, and id seen his work for years. when i was getting my hair cut for the first time at roosevelt, i saw a cut albert was doing and realized that these guys have both mastered their craft. i strongly recommend roosevelt barbershop to anyone looking for a great haircut, conversation and awesome music.
clean shop, good prices, friendly staff, and most importantly, good cuts. i usually go to barber parlor and despite the great service there, it can be inconvenient no appointments, closed on weekends, cash only.  roosevelt barber shop just makes it easier. definitely recommended.
really, all around this is about as good an experience youre ever going to have getting your hair cut.  the dudes working there were really nice, worked quick, my hair came out looking awesome and they offered me a drink within only minutes of my arrival.this place is in a great, central location to downtown and i recommend them as highly as i possibly can.  if youre in the area, walk on down and im sure youll be happy with the service and the final result.
just moved to town last week.   if you travel like me,  you know the trials and disappointments you go through looking for a good barber.  stopped at this app on the north side of downtown today,  and ive already found my new barber.  junior is the man.  started at a 3 on the bottom and faded up to the top, trimmed the top a bit to match.   razor shave on the neck,  sharp lines all around.   shop has a classy, urban feel in a great location on the corner of 7th and roosevelt.   these guys are gentlemen and nice to talk to as well.  highly recommend.  they will grow fast along with downtown and the arts district.
ive had my fair share of bad haircuts and horrible service from numerous amounts of barbershops and salons. but here at the roosevelt barbershop, theres nothing but love and quality! ive been here twice so far and both times have been phenomenal. junior is a great barber who has a lot of experience and takes great pride in what he does. but it really doesnt matter whose seat you sit in, whether it be junior or albert, youll have a great conversation and end up with a great haircut. the overall atmosphere is friendly and gives a very vintage feel with the music they play. i highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great haircut with great service in the downtown phoenix area.
im experimenting with longer hair on the top and a clean look on the side. albert listened to all of my requests and my cut came out perfect! its hard to find someone that can take all your requests and in the first cut make them all happen. i was a little worried about paying for the parking meters, but frank, the owner, ran out and filled the meter for me. also, the interior design is fantastic! very clean and sleek, gentlemen.
i am very meticulous as to how i feel my little mans hair should look. im probably one of those very annoying customers with an opinion on every move made. however, my need to nit pick was not shrugged off but taken into consideration. this barber shop demonstrates a professional environment with a chill vibe! mario did a great job! we just left and the kid already got a handful of compliments on his cut! glad to find a local shop with skills.
decided the try out a facial and hot towel shave.. literally got 3 compliments on my skin within 2 days!
this place is legit. from the waiting area to their style and equipment... jr gave me my taper and combed my pompadour, and he did an excellent job!! was very friendly and chill to talk to. definitely  a place ill be coming back to. great haircuts and great vibe to be in!
i have to say this is the cleanest and most professional barbershop ive been to around the phoenix area. they offer quality haircuts at an affordable price with great customer service. everyone in the barbershop does great hair, but junior is my go to guy. if you are in the downtown area looking for a great hair cut stop in you wont regret it.
jr is the man!! he has been my barber for a long time and his attention to detail never fails to impress me. keep up the great work!!
big junior is best around , but all barbers here get down , best shop in the valley !!!
now my go to place, everyone there is great easy to talk to, yes some reviews say there is a wait time or people come in and they get seated first because they are friends of the barbers. not entirely true some people still book reservations knowing how busy it gets. to me the wait is worth is for the perfection and service i get. great things come with time! i lived right behind this shop now moved out to maricopa, arizona and will continue to come back no matter the drive, thats how much of a great place, service and people i encountered.angel
idk why club tour vegas does not have any reviews yet but it was so much fun and worth it, it was my first time at a vegas club crawl i didnt know if id be into it at first but  dari and arnold where our hosts and they did such a great job, always on top of everything and super fun, the party bus was my favorite part make sure you turn up and dance and wear comfy shoes cuz some of these clubs go on till 6am you can always leave and as long as you keep your bracelet they provide and get a stamp you can revisit any club from that night, a total of 4 clubs that i went too which included hyde, the bank, drais night club, and chateau. i def want to do this again.
xavierhost was awesome!!! didnt feel unorganized and non stop fun. pre game before you go lol because you will open the 1st club and see a rarity of a club with an empty dance floor. lol the party bus was after that  made up for it!! strong drinks  shots! taking pictures at the las vegas sign was fun and when the pics were up they emailed you, within a couple days of your tour.  excellent!!! best value  all the staff are super nice and make u feel comfortable. this is the tour to take, best clubs and great experience around. definitely will do again, thanks guys; 
yes. it was great. we had fun . great venue , host and music.
what an amazing time we had!!! there were 8 of us as a group. even my parents and my parentsinlaws went and they all had such a great time especially at party bus on the way to las vegas sign. tour guys are great so friendly and easy going.
what a great night!! they keep our group together and we had a blast. thanks again guys!!
xavier was amazing we didnt know what to expect since it was our first time doing a club crawl. but if your indecisive on what to do at night or where to go this is a great option! there were drinks on the bus and we had so much fun dancing on the bus with a great dj. he was definitely a great host and very genuine!
went to vegas with friends for a mini vakay and we did the club crawl on november 7, 2015. let me tell you we had a blast. our host xavier was great and energetic made everything happen. we actually completely the whole crawl which we were told alot dont do lol. between the clubs,  party bus, and the vegas sign xavier was great kept the energy going. we would definitely so this again.
my boyfriend and i went to vegas for the first time last weekend and did the club tour on saturday november 15th. it was the most fun night ive ever had and very reasonably priced. our host xavier was awesome at keeping us hype and keeping the party going all night. we went to 3 different clubs. bank at the bellagio was my favorite!! the music, people, and vibe was everything! the fact that i was already tipsy from the free drinks on the party bus also helped...lol xavier even took pictures for us and posted them on the website the next day. overall, one of the best nights ive ever had. if youre looking for a good time, this is it!! :
xavier!!!!! thank you so much! we had a great experience. we wish that when it came to the last club my boyfriend and i felt like lost children in a market looking for papa xavier. other than that damn did we have fun! well be back!
dave took care of our ac issue very quickly.  with temps over 110 he showed great concern for our comfort and had the system back up and running faster than other companies said they could even get to me.  keep his number handy  dave is one of the good ones in a so so industry!
nice guy. quick to come out and help. definitely recommended when you need hvac help.
vegan pasteries, amazing coffee, a constant stream of community activities like game nights, art classes, movie nights, and live music!   whats not to love.glad i found out about this spot its truly an incredible to have this as part of our community.definetly made this a pet of my morning and evening routine!
it looks like they just moved?  anyways we are here.  really good coffee.  vegan pop tarts!  live shows.  barista seems really cool.  chill vibe!
1 word yum! great coffee  vegan pastries, super nice staff. laid back vibe ,not too pricey. i havent been to any of the shows they have there ,but ever time i drive by it seems hopping .tip: try the nitro coffeefor extra fun add kahluabonus their local!
stopped in for some afternoon caffeine on a friday.  the cold brewed coffee is perfectly tasty and nice and strong.  no complaints.  service was nice and the place had lots of interesting stuff to look at if i were to hang around. it was quiet and dark, which isnt surprising for midday on a weekday at a coffee shop.the only difficulty i had was figuring out where the parking lot entrance is. thats only because i dont normally come to this plaza, but im sure not a problem for other people.  its immediately east of kyrene on southern, fyi.i will be back! cant wait to try some of the pastries next time.
excellent! the cold nitro has been making my day for the last couple days. i have picked a few different treats as well, excellent also. while i was in today they were prepping to expand the kitchen, excited for that. great things on the horizon for 51w! keep up the great work. need to pick up one of those awesome shirts one of these days too!
most unique cold brew i have ever had, try their nitro cold brew you wont regret it.
havent found a place like this since i left cali....and good coffee,nice staff....my new go to place for a great latte.

rick was awesome. he called me back within 15 minutes of my call. he came out took a look and let me know my spa was fine. he did a through cleaning and checked everything out. i am very impressed with his customer service and knowledge.
rick saved me 1,000 today!!!the first guy i called charged me 420 to replace the spa pump and then told me that it still didnt work and he couldnt fix the problem.the second guy i called couldnt fix it and referred me to someone else.the third guy said i needed a part that cost 950 and 280 in labor.finally, i got lucky and talked to rick.  he said the same part would cost 450 and about 185 in labor.then when he got there, he was able to fix the spa with no parts to speak of and a total bill of 193.  wahoo!!!!he was quick, courteous, helpful, and best of all, didnt charge me an arm and a leg just because he knew i was desperate!i will definitely call rick again when i need spa repairs or maintenance.
rick saved my spa and brought it back to life after 7 years of being down, he was  quick, knowledgeable and very reasonable. i would definitely call him again for any repair or upgrades to my spa.
rick just left my house. he was on time, thorough, and reasonably priced.i had gotten an estimate from another  company. they wanted over 500.00to fix a leak on my hot tubthey said it was the motor. their estimate was good for five days! i  thought that was a little odd since most estimates are good for at least 30 days. so happy i went with my gut feelings. rick really goes above and beyond what i expected, was less than half the price. give him a call you wont be sorry!im doing the happy dance !
rick was prompt, efficient and reasonably priced. i needed someone to check out my spa and make sure it was operating correctly. additionally, i wanted someone to educate me on the simplest and best way to maintain the spa. he was also very helpful in resolving a spa issue that i had caused myself.overall i feel rick is very knowledgeable and trustworthy, which are qualities that arent always easy to find. i will call rick for my future spa needs. he is a pleasure to do business with.
same great food off the strip always had! not sure why yelp hasnt connected the den to their link but not much has changed besides the name  some of the staff...try the burgers  theyre amazing! or the asparagus wrapped in sirloin ... ooh or the crab cakes! everything is awesome!plus the staff has much improved
this place has the best bartenders and by far the best food you can get in a bar in vegas. its a lithe ways from the strip but well worth the trip no matter what time of day or night you decide to go.
i am so glad this place opened! the juice is great, lots of variety and great prices. everything is non gmo and incredibly fresh. the guy at the counter was friendly and knowledgeable, he was able to point out which juices would be best for breakfast, cleansing and just plain good. ill be back every week to grab my weekly juice!
saw this as i was walking back to my car from made.  they let you try any juice you would like before buying which is awesome.  they have some tasty, tasty juices here for not much more than you pay at whole paycheck or sprouts.  i picked up 6 juices and joined their rewards club which gives you a 25 off an order right off the bat.i shall be back because where else am i going to get rose coconut water?
margaret and brandon were great. tasted each juice before i bought 3 day supply and answered all my questions. locations in so cal is a plus.
the man behind the counter, derek, was really nice to us. we went in there just to check the place out; and he gave us samples of their most popular juices and gave us some at our request. he explained why the juices are so good for you and what processes are behind them. he totally sold us and we walked out with two bottles and a snack as well. the juices look awesome and taste equally as awesome. price isnt that bad considering what goes into them and the service behind it as well.
great, friendly, knowledgable staff. i love the fact that they have nutrition labels on bottles, so you can know sugar content and calories. great selection of both green drinks and more fruity ones, plus they do have nutty ones coffee brews for those who want them. greens 4 and roots 3 ate my favorites. wish they were organic, but ill take non gmo, plus the price is best in town. cant wait for one to open up on the henderson side of town :
just found this little place...its going to be my new juice place.  they have everything that the juice standard or function juicery has, but the prices are so much better!  no cutesy juice names...their juices are called things like greens 1 or roots 3 or citrus 2.  they also have the nut milks, along with a couple of seasonal specialties.  cleanses are under 40 per day and include 6 juices, plus a chlorophyll water and an aloe vera water.  plus there is a 25 discount when you join the rewards program how cool is that?...and you get any juice for free during your bday month.  im a fan!
love pressed juicery! great service every time i visit! i absolutely love greens 2  3, citrus 2, roots 3, brazil nut  vanilla almond . they offer variety of tastes that will surely accommodate anyone! affordable prices as well!! you really cant go wrong.
the first juice bar ive ever experienced was pressed juicery in la years ago... after working at a juice bar for half a year, i need my juices to be perfect and at a reasonable price. pressed juicery has the nicest staff who is more than happy to help you make your decision, they never make you feel rushed, and theyre juices are amazing! probably the cheapest juice bar for 100 organic juices, and im so glad there plastic! im sick of always dropping my bottles and not being able to drink them incase they broke. if your wondering if you should come on by and try it out, the answer is yes you should. they are a county wide business that is doing great for a reason. get your but down there and try some juices, get a cleanse too!
love their juices , the customer service is great , and they usually have good deals when you buy multiple juices! the vanilla almond is the perfect breakfast juice .
im not a big juicer, but went in here with my sis so she could get her juicing fix. until 1114 all their juices are 5, which is a great deal! they will let you stand there and sample anything you want before purchasing, and their customer service was awesome! i ended up getting two of the greens 4 and a lemon cayenne alkaline water. the water is delicious! fresh lemon with a little kick from the cayenne. i had it this morning on my way to work and they were absolutely right, it gave me a nice morning energy and i felt great after drinking it. i think i will go back here and get the full cleanse when i have the extra cash for sure!
love, love, love them! first, the products are top notch. just the plain oj is incredible and one of my favorite cures for the common cold. second, the customer service is incomparable. always helpful, offering samples, and encouraging you to find your own favorite, this team has earned everyone of the five stars. last, make sure you join the rewards program and do the surveys. i got a 25 gift card mailed to me just for sharing my opinion!
convenient location and quick service. ive been here a few times and always leave satisfied. there was only once occasion when they were out of a specific juice, otherwise, i can always find what i want.prices vary based on location. at tivoli village, the 16ounce beverages range 2.50 to 8.00. most of the coldpressed juices are 6.50.favorites:roots 1: beet, carrot, kale, spianch, romaine, parsley, cucumber, celeryroots 3: beet, apple, lemon, gingerapple, lemon, ginger, cayenne pepperbrazil nut: kale, spinach, romaine, brazil nut, vanilla bean, dates, sea salti like roots 1 because its mostly a green juice with tasty root vegetables that add the right amount of sweetness. its also lowsugar! brazil nut is my absolute favorite because its the perfect marriage of healthy greens and tasty nut milk.the coconut cinnamon and orange, turmeric, fuji apple, lemon are also good. there are always a couple seasonal beverages and theyre always worthwhile to check out. this past summer, there was a watermelon lemonade that was really nice. right now, theres a nut milk with almond, dates, sea salt, vanilla bean, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom that is really tasty. they also offer a rewards program. 1 point  1 spent. accumulated points award discounts on juice cleanses and free juices!
ive been drinking the roots three for the past three years. ever since then ive not gotten sick in the winter time. i contribute this place to that. oh and it taste good too.
best place to do a juice cleanse in las vegas. affordable and tastes great.the reward system gives a generous discount twords your initial purchase just for signing up also.
stopped in for lunch to go. i ordered the chicken flauta. large portions and very tasty. i was surprised at how large the entree was. awesome customer service  attentive, friendly and courteous. i like how they repeat your order back to you when they bring you your bag. the place was pretty full for a tuesday afternoon. id return.
went to a yelp event and the food was amazing!!! the staff was very pleasant. theres a hot sauce bar even though i dont do hot sauce, i found it very interesting. the sangria was delicious!!!!
me and my boyfriend love this place. so far we have had the banging chicken burritos and tostados which have a bit of a kick to it, chicken taco salad, black bean and veggie quesadilla, guacamole and nachos i love their nachos they also topped them off when we were leaving, side of black beans and rice best i have ever had even attempted to go home and make it myself.the staff here are always welcoming and curteous i love the new location  closer to our home. i will of course be back!
i went to the woodruff location and was so pleased. the service is super fast and super friendly, the food is so good and i love the atmosphere. i love the folks there they make u feel wanted...
we have wanted to check this place out for a weeks now. so mad we didnt come sooner. great menu for our family of three. awesome prices and the food was amazing. chips werent overly like most places. they were fresh and warm! alexa the manager came over to our table and introduced herself to us and thanked us for coming in. that goes along way with me. the entire staff was extremely helpful and friendly. thank you for coming to the university area. we will be back for sure!
alexis and britney have been great. this is my second time here today and both of them are still providing superb service and delicious food!

i love it!!!  i havent had tijuana flats since i lived in fl so i have to get it whenever im in n.  charlotte.
awesome spa!  the atmosphere is great, and they have the best service.  their prices are also very competitive. highly recommend!
a quaint, clean nail salon and modern spa pedicure chairs that even glow some pretty lights while swirling the water around your toesies! a wide selection of colors including gel polishes and sparkly glitters for whatever mood youre in. definitely a recommend since its close to the strip, but not las vegas strip prices! also open late 11am  11pm for your preclubbing relaxationcome see cathy for all your nail and waxing needs!
super nice people ! they did an awesome job for my wife and all her friends ! new shop just open and its very clean and they do the best job so go stop in and see them today ! thank you kathy and stephanie.
the proprietor, cathy, was friendly and welcoming. the salon is spacious and new with great massage chairs. i had a pedicure and my wife had her nails done. we were both very satisfied, and we would definitely return next time we visit las vegas. funny coincidence, before cathy moved to las vegas, she lived in anaheim, ca, where i grew up, and just a few blocks from where i lived!  small world. :
very nice, clean. friendly staff. cathy was very helpful, and didnt mind that i wifflewaffled and changed my mind on the color after shed applied a bit of the color.  she helped me make up my mind, and my nails turned out great!  parking was easy too :. highly recommend!
if youre looking for a nice, clean, nail salon... look no further!  crystal nail is like the nail salons you expect to see in los angeles.  they have the expensive nail polishes like opi and what not, they sanitize their equipment after every use, the place is noticeably clean and spacious.  ive been looking for a good nail salon near the las vegas strip for the last few months and before i found this place, i was convinced that there werent any decent places... i would try to hold off getting my nails done until i could get back to la.this place was like a breath of fresh air.  cathy was super nice and very sweet.  the place is brand new, so its not super busy yet.  if youre going to book a bridal party in, make sure to call ahead and reserve so she can staff accordingly.my favorite part about this place aside from it being up to par in cleanliness is that they also do deluxe pedicures where you can have essential oils and deluxe pedi baths... so luxurious!they definitely won my loyalty here in vegas.  i recommend to all!
clean and inviting nail spa. friendly service. awesome spa chairs, great pedi. lucked out picking this on a whim while visiting lv for the weekend. would be a regular if i lived here. they have several spalike options to max out your pampering.
i scheduled an appt with stephanie. her and the owner  worked together on my pedi and gel mani. both really nice and welcoming. the salon is spacious and clean with many colors to choose from. price is pretty average and they are open until 11, i dont get off until 7 so its very convenient. most definitely making this my permanent nail home. have the common courtesy to make an appt but they are an up coming nail salon they are open for walk ins.
awesome place. clean, friendly service, and great price. hands down best pedicure ive ever received.
its been a while that ive never been to a nail salon. this definitely awesome!!!! the place is really clean, the staff is really friendly and accommodating!!!! they did a good job on my nails. finally i found the right one for me. i will definitely comeback and invite my friends here. really worth it!!!!
this place is the best nail salon! very clean, friendly and welcoming. most relaxing and refreshing pedi ive had in a long time. stephanie does an amazing job and makes sure youre happy with everything.
new spa. great owners. legit spa. i am a guy and i feel comfortable. i visit vegas on a regular basis and this will be a regular spot for me.
this is george frashers newest venture. not the cheers type of place his former restaurant was but you will find the same friendly and courteous staff as before. i highly recommend the brisket but will caution you to get there before 2 oclock because they generally run out each day. all his barbecue is cooked daily and when its gone they close. the baked beans have a nice kick and there is a limited selection of spirits and beer. all in all another fabulous addition and a great lunch or early dinner spot. congratulations george on another winnerjack k
loving frashers new venture in phx!! get there early because it tends to run out. turkey, chicken, beans and wings are on point!! a great place to grab good food and friendly staff! definitely get the gooey butter cake dessert amazing!
amazing bbq. the food was a great price and hefty portions. loved that you can get the gooey butter cake that was served at the old restaurant.
they just opened so they are slowly adding more to the food and drink menus but, this place is so neat, its modernrustic decor and i love the walls they old wall paper simply painted as well as old brick showing thru. the old refurbished wood tables and trimmings add a ton of character too. the food is bomb, if you like smokehouse food this is one place you should check out. it picks up in the evening and weekend but for now they close at 8 so come for dinner or take out. take out is less than 10 min and all smoke did is made fresh reach day! so come hungry cuz anything you order is unique and amazing. sauce is crazy tasty, the staff is fun and once again the food is so bomb!!!
so as a bbq enthusiast, and having just got back from kansas city literally 12 hours ago, i was excited to try this place having just had some of the best bbq in the country.  i quickly realized these guys share my definition of bbq.  im not going to comment on the services as i got there a little early so the rush crowd wasnt in, this is a new restaurant and at this point the service is expected to be working out the kinks, and unless the service was either spit in your food terrible, or give them a plaque great its really pointless to me since its a thankless job anyway.  having said that they all were working their butts off and was great to be around.right as i walked in i was filled with the wonderful aroma of smoldering wood chips giving my future meal the love it deserves.  the place looked rustic with a modern appeal.  the menu had all the greats when it comes to barbecue.  i was absolutely amazed that they had burnt ends!!  my first time having them was in kc 2 days ago and i fell in love.  they had to be mine.i ordered the baby back ribs and the burnt ends as any lover would do.  i ordered the mac and cheese also but i as more concerned about the meat.  right away i noticed the great pink smoke ring on the meat meaning they took their time in the smoker, vs an oven which i appreciate.  both of them were very tender and filled with the wonderful smoke, and meat flavor that would make a vegetarian blush.  the reviewer before me said that the family is from st. louis so i was surprised that the burnt ends were chopped up so small.  in kc they are in much larger chunks, but maybe they do it differently in st. louis.  still very good though.  i didnt get a chance to talk with the owner but i did see him walking around talking with the customers, and he seemed like a very nice man.  the midwesterner in me appreciates that.  some reviewers before me had some complaints about some pretty petty stuff like the tip line on the receipt when ordering from the till.  get over it.  the only real complaints i have is that the parking lot wasnt very efficient making it difficult to enter and leave.  coming from an engineering and construction background i notice these things but no big deal.  i also noticed that they need to have misters installed on the patio which can be fixed.  all pretty minor when it comes to the real reason why i came here.  deliciously smoked meat.  im definitely coming here again.
fantastic just as you might expect from george and the crew. get ready to leave fat and happy.
great bbq! newly opened restaurant that seems to have a lot of potential, i had the pulled pork and corn as my side. loved both items! the owner was great, i will be back soon!
having waited as long as i could for the opening jitters to clear and for frashers to dial things in, i think i timed it perfectly.  a quiet monday lunch, i was there five minutes after opening, so i could be sure to get everything i wanted.  we were greeted with a smile as we perused the menu.theyve got brisket, chicken, turkey, burnt ends and some other stuff.  sorry, i just homed in on what i was hungry for.  it was tough to decide, so we spread it out.  everything is sold by the pound which makes it easier to order different items, like you are not stuck with a halfpound of something when you want to try other things.  the meats except chicken wings come dry, and they provide squirt bottles of a sweet and a hot bbq sauce.  i tried the hot and it was awesome.  not really hot, but very tasty.they got my vote.  the brisket has just enough chew to it so that it does not fall apart all over the place, the burnt ends are a tasty treat and the chicken wings are large and freshlycooked, slathered with a mild hot sauce they are actually fingerlicking good  we also had the greenchile mac which sported a very mild greenchile flavor and was a bit thick.  i prefer my mac a bit creamier, but i can live with this version.the only real problem i had was that they served our dishes in takeaway containers.  which would be okay if we were actually ordering to go.  we were dining in and it was difficult to grab the brisket sandwich out of the tightfitting container.  i would suggest that they provide plates for dinein customers.
i couldnt wait to try georges newest concept. that area needs a bbq place, and this one is great! i bought the 14 pulled pork, which comes as a sandwich, and french fries. delicious!  ill be back for sure.
we moved to the neighborhood last week and wanted to find a good bbq place.  decided to stop here for dinner and we were pleasantly surprised.  the smoked turkey gumbo was awesome.  the bbq chicken was great and we enjoyed the green chili macaroni  cheese.  the owner, george is a nice guy.  the gooey hot butter cake was very good.  we will definitely return so we can try their other meats.
this is georges newest venture since frashers steakhouse. must try the burnt ends brisket which they smoke an additional 4 hours. i know... about time we got good barbecue in phoenix! this restaurant will competes with little miss bbq!
georgie ole boy..youve done it again.... authentic ,traditional bbq. its what you do best. gotta be one of the best new restaurants in the phoenixscottsdale area. gonna miss frashers steakhouse but i know i am guaranteed killer grub anytime i am in arizona. grab any of the proteins and its a guaranteed awesome meal. in a city like phoenix with few really great choices for bbq...this is the place !!keep up the good work sir. your new spot rules !!
i came for the brisket, amazing!...then did the wings, burnt ends,  cmon they are heavenly, some beers and lemonade, and we finished with the gooey butter cake. ...all was great and cant wait to get back with friends.  also the place looks great!...great old americana mural on the wall, and a nice open retro feel throughout.  cant wait till the bar scene kicks in and we can stay later over some specialty cocktails!  right now they are so kicking they close when the food sells out!!  thats fresh daily made.food and attest to the quality...maybe another smoker is on the horizon cuz we want more!!!!
deeelicious!! ive been to bbq spots before scotssdalegilbert... this one, the meat stands on its own and is enhanced by the variety of bbq sauces. clean, simple and generous. nice job!
this is a down home bbq place with outstanding meats, great side dishes and a buttercake to die for!
best bbq ive had in phoenix.  we tried three different proteins  all of them tasty.  the sauces are each unique and very flavorful.  the buttercake  amazing.  my mouth is watering thinking about it before breakfast this morning.  ill be back for sure  and will bring friends.
outstanding atmosphere and bbq!  the staff is extremely friendly and the owner george is always on premise. that alone shows his dedication to creating a new great restaurant for the arizona locals. do not pass up this place. if you dont know what to order ask the staff they will steer you in the right direction.
loved the steakhouse and love this spot.  other people on here just hating. damn yelpers... dont give a good spot bad reviews for minimal stuff like being out of takeaway menus.  its a new restaurant and concept, going to take a little to get every little detail figured out.  if you want good barbeque, go here!  i dont know of a similar spot in the area thats better.... please enlighten me if there is
out with the old and in with the new!stopped in today with my brother to try some of the grub i have been hearing about for the past few weeks. it really was all that and more!!! i generally dont trust most restaurants with cole slaw, but i have always trusted george and his kitchen and i have to say the slaw is outstanding!!! what was even more perfect was the brisket sliced just the way i like it and the star of it all was the smoked turkey breast. my bro tried the mac and cheese and said it was as good as the original spot. no fried raviolis or late night drinking here, but i actually like this spot better then the old digs on scottsdale rd. service couldnt have been any better from the nicest lady, and it was great to cross paths and palms again with george.  stop in cause these guys have cued up some mighty fine bbq.
awesome place  george did great with this new place  completely different than the former frashers steak house, but some old favorites are still on the menu gooey buutercake, mayfair salad, garlic mashed potatoes,...
awsome   we really enjoyed it. great food and the owner greats u at the door. george.   his staff is great   our new favorite arcadiabiltmore bbq. thanks george
best bbq ive had since i lived in kansas city! the turkey is the truth! good sides as well.  they keep it simple and the focus is definitely on the food.
holy cow! this place is amazing! had to try this spot since its new in the neighborhood and i love bbq. food was excellent, service is super friendly and the ambiance is casual perfect for dinner out with my fam which includes my rambunctious 2 year old.  im a huge bbq sauce fan so its great that you can grab a bottle of your choosing and have as much as you like. surprise free dessert at the end best ooey gooey carmel cake yum!will be back again and again
this was literally a last minute decision to stop here, and im really glad we did.  this place has only been opened for about 2 months.  they have their grand opening coming up the second week of september.  the decor is great, i love the simplicity of the menu and the staff was friendly.  we ordered the 3 meat combo and had pulled pork and brisket x 2.  both meats were wonderful and the homemade sauces are amazing.  both my boyfriend and i say the spicy wins but the others are really good as well.  tennessee tangy and sweet and then some tangy mustard that we did not try.  there are plenty of sides to choose from, dessert gooey butter cake  sounds amazing and a kids menu.  one thing i noticed while we ate was that the staff was always moving and busy.  all three foh girls were productive the entire time whether they were checking on customers, refilling sauce containers, bussing tables, general cleaning up and restocking, etc.  i was very impressed.  overall, a fantastic experience and we will be sure to give more of the menu a try next time!
new places can be a little scary for the first few months...they havent figured everything out between the food and the service and as excited as we always are for new places, we dont want to be let down because the company hasnt gotten their stuff together yet, but this place...as far as i am concerned, has got it together. we went for lunch and sat at the bar and had a great serverbartender who chatted with us but also left us alone if we were eating or talking with each other  he was great. he suggested a few things on the menu  like the tri tip instead of the brisket  which were good. we got the three meat platter, green chili mac and cheese and the chicken wings. the chicken and pulled pork were the favorites while the tri tip was good...we liked the others better. our favorite sauce was the tennessee sauce  tangy and spicy and i could have drank the stuff. the mac and cheese was delicious as well! some of our favorite wings are the grilled wings we get at lgo and frashers was up to par with their wings  yes that good. i loved what they did inside compared to how the old baja loco was. it was natural wood and a great, simple vibe focusing on the food and service. the patio has upgraded furniture which looks comfortable and inviting and we cant wait to go back and hang out there. george, the owner, was there and making his rounds. he seemed like a really cool guy and was really proud of his product...as he should be. i would love to go back and chat with him again and try more things on the menu!
great foodawesome staff.everyone is very attentive and friendly.you have to try the smoked turkey and the gumbo ...they were both awesome!!!!great foodstaff and ambiance.great work!keep up the good work.
this place is amazing. we have tried almost everything on the menu and have not been disappointed. the staff is beyond friendly, and service is so fast. we dont live around the area but its worth the drive for sure.
what a great addition to the neighborhood!  stopped in this evening to try out the menu. the parking lot is filled with the fantastic smells of the outdoor smoker. the inside is clean but perfectly set as a bbq joint. the staff was all very nice and offered a great overview of the offerings. daughter had the ribs, and is now addicted.  i tried the gumbo, and can honestly say that it is one of the best gumbos i have had, ever. i have traveled a bit and had my share, but this one is off the chart. lastly, i had the two entree combo, with brisket and pulled pork. epic. well done frasher. welcome to the hood.
so very different than the old frahers on scottsdale rd that you wouldnt know that they moved because it is so very different.  much more like a midwestern bbq restaurant than a dark dive bar as it was.  the menu was small but everything we ordered was good.  the chicken wings were the bomb.  the smoker is outside the front patio.  they have a small bar area but it isnt the kind of place youd want to hang out in but the beverages are more just to go along with the meal.  had a very small selection of craft beer and well drinks.  service was good and friendly.
by far the best gumbo  corn bread i have ever had!!!i have been craving it all week!!! i cant wait to try the burnt ends next time. oh the smoked turkey was amazing too!
this is the second time i have eaten here. both times were delicious. the meat was moist and i like that i get to add the bbq sauce. the mac and cheese was delicious too. we will definitely be back. thank you, george for another great restaurant!
we ate here yesterday and it was wonderful.  the staff were so nice to us and the food was great.  i highly recommend getting the burnt ends, so yummy! frashers will be a regular stop for us, whenever were in phoenix.the restaurants clean and nicely decorated, the food is great and the staff are very accommodating and have a great attitude.  what more could you want?
what an awesome place!  this is the old chuys location....when you enter, you are greated with awesome  aromas and friendly staff...the decor is warm and inviting....the menu is simple, a less is more approach....my daughter and i do not usually eat bbq, but came here with our family to help my dad celebrate his 78th birthday and he loves bbq! we ordered a tri tip sandwich, fries,  a house salad, and their green chile mac n cheese....the portions were decent sized and the flavor of all was delicious...we even brought home leftovers :... there were 16 people in our group and everyone enjoyed their meal tremendously!! come and give them a try....george the owner is a very friendly guy and is doing a terrific job!  thanks george for a wonderful experience!
we loved frashers steakhouse and were sorry to see it go after so many years.  but we have been to the new frashers several times now and found the food to be just as good as at the original frashers.  all the meat is incredibly flavorful and tender.  the atmosphere is casual but comfortable.  1st class barbecue!
awesome place!  great location; service and excellent selection and food.  fair price for great food.  thank you.
had the ribs for lunch today and they were outstanding. will be coming back very soon. im very picky about coleslaw, and this was exactly what i like. owner was visible and made sure everyone was happy. atmosphere was great for our group, we will make this a destination for us regularly.
i love my ribs. ive eaten ribs in all of the classic bbq towns in the us... frashers ribs rank up there with the very best. the pulled pork was also excellent. the sweet and hot sauce, i would happily consume as my beverage for the evening. mac and cheese? yum. the service was friendly, energetic and welcoming. the decor is rustic... as it should be for an authentic bbq joint. blues tunes add to the ambiance. quality food, reasonably priced. overall i really enjoyed the place. ill be back, often.
i got the baby back ribs with jalapeno mac n cheese and corn!! sooo good i had this for my cheat meal and will definitely be back... put bbq sauce on the bread and make a mac n cheese sandwich!!!! best thing ever
their pulled pork is one of the best i have had in the area. the service is nice 100 of the time and it creates a nice neighborhood feel. will definitely continue to eat here.
great casual place with very nice staff  very juicy  tender meats!!! mac  cheese awesome!!
best bbq i have had in phoenix. new restaurant that i hope people find out about and keep it thriving. nice outdoor seating and the inside smells divine. very friendly staff and you order the register and its a pretty quick turnaround to when your food arrives. just sooooo good. prices are great. 8 to 10 is the average.the sides were fine. i liked the corn, mac and cheese was ok as were the mashed potatoes. but the ribs, oh, my heaven, were the best ever.
great barbecue. the turkey platter was excellent. my wife is a vegetarian. she ordered four sides  loved all of them. george frasher is an excellent host. oh,  try the gooey butter cake. i usually dont eat desserts; i devoured it. great decor.
disregard the negative reviews, above. theres nothing to dislike, here. good bark on the meaty baby backs. i ordered the twopound plate with 10 bones with the sole intent of having some bones to take home for tomorrow nights supper. other stellar servings and moments: friendly, courteous staff members. and when you tell them thank you they dont say no problem.  instead the proper youre welcome. or its equivalent. the veggies served with the wings were killer. fresh. crisp.  crunchy. and cold as ice. i ordered extra carrots; i couldnt stop eating them.  the ranch dressing served with the wings was better than any ive ever tasted. honest to pete. creamy. perfectly seasoned. damn near drinkable! green chili mac was killer diller. baked beans were near chililike. a bowl of em and a  slip of saltines would be good on a cold, winter night.  the texas toast was delicious and buttery.  toasted on the griddle jus like this texas boy is used to.  the bread had the same tooth as potato bread, however the breads packaging referenced not a spud. i couldve eaten a whole loaf but i didnt wanna push my luck having ordered extra carrots.   house music is good ol blues and mellow rock at precisely the right volume.  if i wasnt driving id dive into one of the bars bottles of tequila.  george, the owner, is a cutiepatootie teddy bear. now, if the joint added apricot fried pies to the dessert menu, thus ol texas boy would be forever grateful. otherwise, the joints a winner.check it out or miss out.
by far the best barbecue in the valley that i have found thus far. for not being a fan of turkey, this was the best thing i had on the menu! the gumbo was out of this world, and paired with the jalapeno cornbread, you cant out do it! i cant say enough great things about this place.
what a great spot.  nice decor, simple but outstanding menu.   im have had the chicken, turkey, and brisket so far and all have been top notch.
disregard the negative reviews here.  you go to this place to get barbecue and thats what these guys know and do best.  my wife and i got the baby back ribs and burnt ends translation: the good parts of the brisket which were amazing on their own.  then add one of their three bbq sauces we loved the spicy sauce, theres also tennessee tangy and a sweet bbq sauce and it makes these meats mouthwatering.  i would go back just for the baked beans which are some of the tastiest beans i have had.  the corn side is grilled on the cob then sliced off  delicious as well.  the owner, george previously of frasers steakhouse, came out to check on all the guests which was a nice touch.  im looking forward to going back and trying the tritip and turkey!  thanks, guys, for satisfying our craving for bbq!
id been craving smoked turkey ever since i saw that honey bears occasionally offered it. so when i mentioned it to my son the other night, he suggested checking out frashers website to see if they carried it. id completely forgotten that this place had opened in the old nearby chuys. they did! we went over to order some takeout for monday night football  and decided to try a few things ... a rack of ribs, pound of smoked turkey, side of beans, side of chili macncheese, and some cornbread later, the family has a new goto for our carnivorous indulgences!!! yum! this is the real kcstyle deal: dryrubsmokedfalloffthebonemeltinyourmouth deliciousness!!! the sauces are okay, but not really necessary. the mac was good. but, those beans!! omg! theyre a meal unto themselves. when we realized we hadnt ordered any cornbread, they threw some in for us to try. deelish!! loved the friendly staff; devoured the amazing dishes; promised well be back  again and again!
wow!!! my mouth was just in awwww its delicious! i had the pulled pork with a side of green chile mac and cheese, i also tried some of my hubbys burnt end sandwich and baked beans, and yeah its good! this place has a great presentation inside and out, friendly staff, great portions too!
same day service, prompt, professional and knowledgeable.  dishwasher fixed and working fine. i would defiantly recommend to friends and family!
i have used loes a couple of times now for various items and i will continue to use them in the future.  knowledgeable, honest and professional!!
my refrigerator blew out a relay and i was losing food in the freezer and fridge overnight.  i called six 6 appliance repair shops that advertised same day service, the earliest one wanted to schedule out 5 days later, the latest two weeks.  i called laron loe and he was there within a couple of hours.  assessed the problem, had the part on hand, rolled up his sleeves and additionally cleaned up the compressor coil.  end resultthe unit works like new.  best part: exceptionally reasonable pricing.  this is a journeylevel professional that will take care of your appliance issues posthaste and without lame excuses. pretty rare these days.  combine that with an extremely friendly and professional demeanor and youve got a winning equation. laron comes with my highest recommendations.  do yourself a favor and call him for rapid solutions.thanks again, laron.ernest orrernest_orrmsn.com
everyone has to try this at least once . i was nervous about doing it because i have never been artistic . never painted on an easel  only color by numbers in kindergarten and i wasnt that great! i have to say it was a wonderful fun experience . heather our teacher and guide was so accommodating  and encouraging even when i had a paint boo boo ! i learned you can fix anything ! i attended the sunflowers painting session and plan to attend others in the future !
paint party night is a super fun,  affordable night out doing something creative and different for a girls night out or a date night.  heather, the primary instructor is a skilled fine artist and an art teacher so its more than drinking wine and splashing around on a canvas... you actually finish the night with real art, regardless of talent. i cant say enough about how much fun ive had participating in three different parties.  one included my 10 year old daughter.  great idea for her next birthday party! thanks, paint party night!
if your looking for a fun night this would be the place to visit. as a first timer my experience was just as i pictured it heather is awesome fun and the whole staff was very entertaining.this group has taken painting to a whole new level. thanks for showing us a great time. i will be booking with them again for a romantic paint and drink session.sequoia
tons of fun! heather is wonderful and lead a great class. my fiance and i have done a few paint nights before with other places and this was our favorite. it was nice to be able to order food as well as drinks while we painted. we will be going again soon. we are looking forward to one of the couples paintings.thanks for a great evening!
so fun, heather, the instructor, is great!  go with a few friends and drink wine while you paint. easy to follow heathers instructions and create your very own master piece! i plan on going again and maybe even doing a group party for my birthday!
this shop is awesome! johnny vegas is an amazing tattooer. ive had numerous pieces done here. the atmosphere is always welcoming, and the staff is very nice, and accommodating. i have sent a number of people here who have always been very satisfied with the work theyve received. not only does johnny vegas tattoo, he also does custom painting and pin striping that is equally as amazing! the prices are always reasonable. and there is no piece that cant be done. i have and will continue to be tattooed by johnny vegas and will continue to send anyone who wants quality work done to him. trust me he is well worth checking out.
been coming to johnny vegas since my first tattoo back in 2011. and i must say he is the very best! shop is very clean and very friendly! very time i come to vegas i have to come in to the shop and get new art!!! your in vegas live a little!!
ive been coming too johnny vegas since 2006 for . my first tattoo. go back every time im in town.  almost half selves on both arms now. clean professional environment. friendly. you will not  leave without a smile. no regrets when leaving with new ink. if u want what u pay for here is the shop for you!
i have gotten most of my tattoos done here by johnny vegas. i must say he is the best of the best. he was reffered to me by one of my friends a few years back and i havent stopped coming back. very professional, great atmosphere and extremely clean and steril environment. he is my go to guy when i need anything! thanks johnny vegas, ill see you soon for next piece of art :
had the shop recommended by a friend back in early 13...johnny did an awesome job and knocked out work on  both forearms in one sitting.  no problems at all and they both healed up much quicker than previous nonjohnny vegas work id had done on the east cast.  easy to deal with and everything else youd hope for in your tattoo shop.  headed back out to the west coast next week and looking to add two more to the collection.  on to vegas for the weekend!
seriously, why doesnt this place have more reviews? i went two years ago to get a piercing while in vegas celebrating my birthday with some friends. to commensurate the trip we all decided to get piercings or tattoos. johnny vegas did our piercings and he was just great! the price was super affordable in comparison to other shops nearby. im deadly afraid of needles and he was super patient with me even after much hesitation and indecisiveness on my part. he started talking to me and asked me a few questions and in a matter of seconds it was all over. it hurt like heck, i wont lie but so glad i finally went through with it. it was something i wanted done for a while. i healed great with no complications. two years later and it still looks great!the shop was clean but the area is a little sketchy so use good judgement.
great experience like no other!! finally a great indian restaurant to go and taste their exquisite dishes....love atmosphere decoration and service....thanks so much for having india in las vegas!!!
i am so happy to have found this place and i will definitely be back...many times.  i spotted this place on my way to get my haircut and decided to drop in for lunch.  my plan was to grab food to go, but once i took a look at the beautiful decor inside i decided to stay, and im glad that i did.  the service was excellent and the food was so flavourful that i almost lost my self respect and licked the plates.  i had the vegetable samosas appetizer and the chicken saag with plain rice and garlic naan.  the chefowner was very sincere and welcoming.  i thanked him for the wonderful meal and wished him much success for the future.   if you are a fan of indian food then you are in for a real treat here.
i eat indian food all the time i asked them to make it mild and it is always so spicy all as i could taste is the spices i came to this new restaurant near my house i was so excited they made it just the way i asked the food was so amazing and flavorful the staff was so nice we met the cook he was so nice he was also the owner of the restaurant was so clean im so excited to have this restaurant near my house this will be my new favorite indian restaurant absolutely love it
my wife and i love indian food and we were both thrilled that there is now a indian restaurant 5 minutes from out house.  we started with the garlic shrimp for our appetizer. it had a perfect crust on the outside and the spices we ordered it mild were just right. my wife had papad she cant have gluten and i had the garlic naan bread and both were good and the sauces they came with were delicious. for the mains, my wife had the lamb nihari and i had the murgh makhani chicken thighs. the sauces that they came in.....out of this world!! i could have licked both plates clean!  we would order these again without hesitation, but next time we go and it will be soon, we would try their other dishes. the staff was friendly and the prices were not out of line.  easily 5 stars.  we cannot wait to come back!!
food was absolutely fantastic!  service, very slow :  they are brand new though, so i expect a few speed bumps with the service component.  realistically though, as long as the food is great, you can overcome bad service.  the service wasnt really bad, it was just really slow.for apps we had the lamb seekh kebab, samosa teen tarike se  garlic shrimp.  all really good but garlic shrimp was on a level all on its own.for entrees, we had the tandoori salmon, lamb vindaloo  chicken tikka masala.  again, all really excellent!  asked for mild to accommodate the child in the party and my wife that likes it a little less spicy than myself.  all arrived with good portions and mild.  still tons of flavor and dipping the garlic naan in the sauce is always a must.we also had the side kuchumber salad.  again, excellent.we were so stuffed we had to pass on dessert and had some leftovers to enjoy for lunch.  we will definitely be back.  its now on the rotation for pickup on the way home after a long day.i recommend it highly!!!
excellent food. everyone was really welcoming and nice. food was amazing specially the samosa trio and dessert kulfi trio must try.
drove 14 miles from one indian restaurant to here. and it was well worth not just the drive but the price. food is exceptionally well done amongst all vegass indian restaurants. staff is super nice and very friendly and knowledgable. main chef is thinking out of box. samosa trio amazing. worth every bite.
food is definitely worth trying. loved the lunch specials, great price. service not the greatest though. im just glad theres a indian place on the west side now.
stopped in on a whim  best decision of the week!  food is incredible so many flavors blended to perfection! its not often i cant wait to get home to post on yelp but knew i was going to immediately. prices are reasonable, service was attentive, atmosphere is inviting, portion size is generous and oh! the food!!  will be craving this place again soon!  no doubt we will be back!
i love indian food and have tried many restaurants around las vegas. i was so happy to see an indian restaurant close to my home. i was pleasantly surprised! the food was delicious! samosa appetizers are very good! : the chicken tikka was great too! i highly recommend the butter naan. i cant wait to go back to this restaurant and try it again! i would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves indian food or good food in general!
this place was great. nice ambiance. we got the chicken masala and the saag. and samosas for the appetizer. we also got the plain and butter naan. everything was fantastic. they had the option to get everything either mild, hot or very hot. so, we got hot. they mean hot too. perfect. i would definitely go back and have it the same way. very attentive staff and the chef came out to personally check on everyone to make sure they were happy. great service, food and location.
so happy to have a good indian restaurant on this side of town. the food is absolutely delicious and they make even traditional indian dishes in a unique way. service is excellent and they did a cool remodel on the old nagoya location.
finally an indian place on our side of town.  well be back for sure to try other dishes.  we liked everything that we tried last week.
we finally have a great indian restaurant on our side of town.  took my parents and brother from out of town there for a belated fathers day dinner.  my parents previous experience with indian food was sparse and bad.  my father said he thought indian food was gross and my mom said she got the runs the only time she ate it.  but, my reputation for picking good places to eat is deservedly awesome so they went with it.i ordered lamb saag and chicken tikki masala with garlic and butter naan on the side.  samosas for appetizer.  pretty standard but i wanted to go with popular dishes and maximize the likelihood theyd enjoy it.  i shouldnt have worried...the food was really excellent.  flavorful and beautiful.  the samosas were nice and crispy on the outside and no toughness to the pastry at all.  it just shattered in your mouth like it should.  fillings and sauces were delicious.the saag and tikki masala were excellent.  excellent with rice, excellent with the naans, and excellent eaten all by themselves.  i ordered them mild because of the parents but i think a little heat would have made them even better.  ill do that next time.our dessert was absolutely fantastic as well.  we normally dont get dessert since chinese usually just eat fruit or weird sweet soups but i ordered us the milk cake with vanilla ice cream to share.  fantastic buttery note on the cakes finish and the ice cream was fantastic.  nice contrast of hot cake and cold ice cream.  it really was the best dessert ive had in a long time and at 5 it was a steal.  if you ordered that on the strip its 12 easily.hope everyone checks this place out.  the chef told me theyve been busy but when i went it was near empty.  we need this place to thrive.  its exactly the kind of neighborhood restaurant that deserves to be a huge success.  decor was beautiful and the service was excellent.  waitress and bartender were beautiful and that never hurts either.  ;  highly recommended.
very happy and excited to have a nice indian restaurant on the west side. lunch specials and nice portions. very clean and service was excellent. .. will bring the family next time
except for the fact that they dont have chicken curry this place is 5 star worthy. the waitress was very nice and polite. i was craving chicken curry but instead suggested madras with chicken. not the same but definitely good!!
my lovely wife and i spotted this place driving through on errand day. we stopped in and peeked at the menu and dining room and were intrigued. later that day we yelped it and checked out some of the photos. we were hooked in and returned this evening for dinner. we ordered the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala and the lamb biryani at a medium level spice for both meat dishes. each dish was equally delicious, well prepared and generous in portions. we are small eaters and have enough leftovers for two more meals for the two of us. wed definitely encourage las vegas natives and visitors alike to try this place out and soon!  they just opened three weeks ago and we personally think they should be very successful. we will definitely be back to try the saag and the rogan josh.
the food here is amazing.  great portion sizes.  service was quick and friendly.  the flavors of the food were robust and well balanced.  the lunch menu comes with naan and rice.  dinner is al a cart.  i will definitely be back.
my wife and i came to try this place out. it use to be a sushi place but theyre redecorated and it looks awesome. my wife ordered the malai kofta and i the chicken tikka masala. her dumplings were pretty big and i ordered mine hot, it was very hot!!! we enjoyed it and will be back because its in our area :
im a garlic fanatic but the butter nann is better than the garlic nann trust me. and the service sucks but food is really good.
wow! our meal was really good. i got the chicken tikka masala and angie got the lamb rogan josh. for appetizers we got the chili paneer and roasted bell pepper soup. everything was great! we will be back!
truly authentic delicious indian food. great to have in our neighborhood! chicken tiki masala outstanding!
by far the best indian food i have tasted in town! this restaurant is a gem, tucked away in the back of a shopping center. the decor, menu and food are all beautifully presented...with the food being exceptionally delicious. they have only been open about a month...please be sure to put this on your list of restaurants to go to soon, so this gem doesnt get buried.
the food is delicious! curry leafs food has so many amazing flavors. i had the chicken saag and it was to die for! the tikka masala is also a favorite of mine great texture and perfect amount of spicy. i love this place i will be a life long customer. so happy to have a indian restaurant on this side of town.
i have had a lot of indian food in my life. i love indian food. this is hands down the best indian food i have had and not only in vegas, not only in the us  but in my life.came here with my boyfriend to try something new and saw good reviews on here. unfortunately i have celiac so cant have any gluten. we called ahead and asked, the dude on the phone said no gluten  no problem. so we went.and we are both blown away.after letting the super sweet and attentive waiter know im gluten free, we started with the chili paneer. when it came out we noticed it was breaded so i got scared for a second; then out of the blue the chef and owner ritesh comes to the table, introduces himself and says dont worry about the breading, i used rice and chickpea flour for you so it would be gluten free. wow! such dedication to great service.the chili paneer was absolutely unbelievable and so were our entrees chicken tikka marsala, paneer vindaloo, and sides of yellow dal and eggplant.we will definitely be back and i cannot recommend this place enough. whether youre gluten free or not, the food here is so fantastic and the staff and owner are so amazing that youre missing out if you dont give it a try!!
so happy to find a nice indian restaurant with no standard lunch buffet setup. food is really good, nice spice, clean and vibrant seating area. highly recommended..
unusual and standard items.  we tried the soft shell crab and calimari appetizer served with indian  spices.  the entrees were lamb saag and shrimp madras.  both were very tasty.  garlic naan was perfect for dipping in the sauces.
yummy!! this place is great! we just had the from scratch naan bread, chicken vindaloo and chicken tiki masala and all three were really good. they offer mild medium and hot spice levels and the medium was just the right amount of heat while still allowing us to taste our food. the atmosphere looked really nice but we just did take out. i will definitely be eating here again!!
beautiful resturant. i loved the food. curry is my fav
very good. always pleased. medium is pretty spice and a good mix if you like spice. dont get hot unless youre really into it. awesome currys and everything has been top notch.
best indian restaurant weve found in vegas! only been open two weeks when we saw the sign on ft. apache as we drove past the yellow pillars on the west side of the street. foods fabulous, prices are reasonable, tastefully decorated, and you can ask for the levelintensity of flavorspice mild, medium, hot, super hot.go visit and try their mango lassi to drink instead of the boring pepsi or tea. its cool, sweet and creamy and made with yogurt. yum!! we also had the chicken tikka masala, garlic naan and gulab jamun for dessert. it comes with almonds and ice cream, but i cancelled those and asked for extra saucesyrup yum!.this style of cooking indian food is what we call comfort food in our family, and were just plain old vegas folk from the midwest. forgot to mention theres no buffet, you order from the menu.been there multiple time, never disappointed, and now they have their liquor license as of july 25 so that should please the thirsty.  go try.
super delicious! everything was piping hot and so fresh! this place is definitely now my go to indian cuisine restaurant!
really really yummy! clean and very nice service! i cant wait to go back!the chili chicken is amazing! i hope they open up the patio for outdoor dining when the weather gets a little nicer!  ive been twice now and birth times have been of excellent quality,taste,and service!
enjoyed everything!  chili paneer is amazing with a great blend of flavors. very nice yet comfortable atmosphere.
amazing experience. i ordered the samosas, chicken tikka masala, and a curry dish. the flavorful food, friendly staff and fabulous service make this my new favorite indian restaurant. great prices too. i cannot wait to go back!
mmmm! we checked out this place based on other reviews, and yup! delicious! we started with flaky samosas, then had chicken tikka masala  vegetable korma. we got medium heat, not knowing quite what to expect, and it was slightly hotter than other mediums around town, but delightful! service was great,  the restaurant is spotless  elegant.
this place is for real. great food. nice atmosphere. nice staff.we ordered the chicken version of the chili paneer or chicken appetizer.  very good flavor.  like a  chineseindian fusion.chana masala, chicken tikka masala, and the eggplant which i cannot remember how to spell. all were very good and all had distinct flavors. we will be back to try some lamb dishes.only suggestion is to have the door cleaned where the previous business had its hours. it is unattractive.
food is super delicious and very fresh!
i tried the lamb viryani it was great.  also had the the lamb curry it has to much oil and less meat then the couple of other indian places ive been to but an overall im giving them a 5 star. i know this place is new and will be back again.
for starters, we were quite impressed with the decor, a mixture of traditional and modern.  great lighting, too. it has a large patio, not quite set up yet, but it was way too hot to eat outside anyway.  i asked about a wine list, and our waiter, navi, brought over a single page that had two whites and four reds along with a few beers.  im a white wine drinker, but cant handle either of the two, chardonnay and pinot grigio.  they honestly get me sick.  he offered to go to the nearby liquor store and bring back anything i wanted.  i was going to skip the wine horrors!, but the owner came out.  he explained that they were set to have a meeting this week with the wine rep, and they were working on setting up a full bar service, including more and different wines and specialty cocktails.  though i posted a pic of the current list, im going to remove it.  i dont think its fair to keep it, since the restaurant is new and still a work in progress.the owner, ritesh, is a highly educated professional who switched to cooking as a second career.  we thoroughly enjoyed talking with him, and his desire to please radiated during our whole meal.  he insisted that navi go get the wine i wanted, so i acquiesced. i was a happy camper.the menu is so atypical of the usual indian restaurant.  its very small, but everything is cooked fresh.  ritesh explained that this allows him to focus on the quality of each dish.  he will, though, be adding a few other items, including a thali, which we love to order, since it allows you to sample a variety of food.we started with samosas, an order of three:  one with peas, another with potato, and the third with paneer and corn.  i dont think ive ever seen corn in an indian restaurant before.  they were incredibly light, with pastry unlike the usual chinese eggroll stuff you usually get, and the fillings were delicious, expecially the paneer and corn.  im not a pea lover, but loved the dense filling of that one.  the creamy mint and tangy tamarind sauces were yummy.for our mains we shared a saag curry bowl, with chicken added, as well as paneer and fresh vegetables.  we ordered both of our dishes mediumspicy, and thats how it was.  along with that we got baingan barta, and the smaller size of smoked eggplant dish was a good accompaniment to the large portion of saag. the garlic naan we ordered was covered with minced fresh garlic. last time we had it, at a different place, i couldnt even see or taste garlic.  as it was, i could barely eat much of the main courses after the filling samosas, but then, im not a very big eater.  well have my very favorite meal  leftovers  tonight.as if the great food and phenomenal service werent enough, a treat awaited us at the end.  our wonderful waiter was nearby and heard me toast herb for his birthday.  he said oh, is it your birthday?  i told him it had actually been two days before.  but when we finished packing up the leftovers, navi and ritesh came out with a birthday dessert for us to share  their beautiful kulfi trio:  mango, pistachio and raspberry, artfully presented on a long rectangular plate.even better than the fact that it was a delicious meal, it was a special and memorable experience, and i wish curry leaf a long and prosperous life.
if you are an indian food lover, this place is a must go! from the tandoori lamb appetizer, to the chicken tikka masala, papadums, potato and eggplant side dishes...it was all amazing!! so much so, we ordered a second helping of chicken tikka to take home with us. having an english mother, ive grown up on indian food so i know my stuff. to top it off, the service is amazing. highly recommend this place!
n here is the place i am looking for last six months.for indian food lovers this place is one stop destination, great service ,highly recommended.
great food with great price with awesome atmosphere, especially when you are away from your native home india and you are seeking for some really great indian food then its one of the best place in us. i personally went to dozens of indian restaurant in different state but i like the food of this restaurant the most. their kadaai paneer is best. we also tried samosa and paneer chilly in starter and they are fabulous. they also have bar and if you are mojito lover then you should try it over here. it was great.so if you are hungry and want some indian food and this restaurant is 2 hour far from you then also you should go for it, because its worth it.
best indian food in town!! i am used to great indian food from new dehli and london and i will make this my regular spot from now on! they have a very nice ambiance as well and now they have their liquor license and therefore it will be a good place for dinner as well!! love this place! great service too! two thumbs up!
this is great finally an indian restaurant near summerlin. its in a small strip mall south of tropicana on fort apache. when you walk inside the place is beautiful, spotless and the decor is really nice. nothing like any indian place in town. the food is excellent in taste and quality. i had a cucumber salad to start us off and it was so tasty because of the dressing. they took time to cut up the vegetables and it was presented beautifully. chicken vindaloo curry and chicken tikka masala curry medium were so full of flavor we were both surprised. if chunks of white meat chicken as well. plain rice came with both and we ordered a side of lemon rice. first time ever i have had a side rice that actually tasted of what they said it was. light and fluffy yellow and tasted of lemon. not over powering but you knew. two beers and a glass of wine with garlic naan bread that was awesome and it was 60 dollars, a really good deal for a lot of food. smaller menu than any indian place we have seen which is nice. too many places have ten page menus and there is no way you can make that many dishes well. smaller menu means quality and it showed. if you like indian food you have to try this place. we need to support our local owned restaurants. chains are a dime a dozen and places like this are so nice to have you wont be disappointed.
one of the best indian restos ive tried in vegas! good portions, not overly hotspicy when we asked for mild on some dishes, and the service was great!
the curry leaf is close by and new to my area. im taking a cooking class and i selected indian as my project of study for my unit assignment.  i was amazed at how nicely decorated the inside was!  a nice small bar, and the manager navjot greeted me in his great indian accent. i explained i was there on a class assignment and would he help me select a totally vegan meal. he helped me pick out and appetizer, main dish, side dish and vegan bread. then the chef ritesh patel also the owner came out and answered the many questions i needed for my class assignment regarding main ingredient, herbs, spices.  he even explained garamma salsa to me! both shared about the food and eating customs in various regions in india...then the food came out and it was amazing!  chef  ritesh said any plate on the menu he can made vegan upon request all all the food is prepared fresh.  i have my school assignment to thank for this wonderful food and meeting these wonderful people, but on my own i will be back and recommend this to my friends...vegan and nonvegan!  ps. chef ritesh said, call me if you have any questions or need help when you are preparing your school project!  such a beautiful atmosphere, clean, professional, with a family attitude! thank you retesh  navjot for helping me with my class project!!!  excellent and authentically indian!!!
delicous food and the paneer chili is amazing. anybody who comes must try. the lassi is delicious and perfect and my server navi is the nicest person and very attentive. i drink lots of water so he was on it. yumm
delicious!we had the chicken vindaloo, vegetable biryani, naan, and a delicious chickpea dish. even the leftovers were gone by day 2. my husband and i also noted this food was less greasy than some other indian restaurants in town  a definite plus. we will go back!
i love it. end of story. jk, this place is honestly amazing! i had a mild tikka masala and i loved it. they give you individual portions of rice and naan which is really great and the portions are just the right size to fill up on, but not overeat. the atmosphere is a1 and the staff are also very friendly!
finally! a indian food restaurant that doesnt charge ridiculous prices and tastes great! the decor is very fashionable and well themed for the food. we tried the samosa, chicken tikka masala, and chicken khorma... everything was delicious.. the garlic naan is strong and very flavorful.. the samosas tasted great! the service was top notch and we are so happy to have this restaurant open near our home.. it will be our go to for indian food
finally, indian food on my side of town, and its actually really really authentically delicious!!! from the garlic nana, the chili paneer, and lamb rogan josh, everything ive had on this menu was amazing! great service, very attentive staff and a full bar :
excellent service and delicious food! we got the garlic naan, chicken tikki marsala, red pepper soup, and some vegetable curry dish. all were great! we will be back!
very excited to have this amazing indian restaurant close to where i live, work, and play. the restaurant is simply beautiful, the food is top notch, and the service was excellent.we started with the garlic naan bread and baingan bharta, which is tandoori smoked eggplant that is mashed with various herbs. it comes in a small half size pot for half the price making it easy to combine with any entree. the flavors were extraordinary.this was followed by two curry entrees, each served with long grain white rice. we had the chicken tikka masala and the lamb vindaloo at a medium spice level. the tikka masala has marinated chicken chunks with an oniontomato tandoor sauce. the vindaloo has a distinctive onion, garlic, red chili  vinegar sauce flavor. they were both mouthwatering!   but, literally, the vindaloo was slightly more spicy than the tikka masala due to the red chilis. of course, the temperature is nothing for those that enjoy heaping spoonfuls of overpowering spiciness on a regular basis.i cant wait to try more items on the menu. the only downside: the restaurant has a suggested gratuity on the check that is between 1520 of the grand total including tax. gratuity should not be factored on top of sales tax; maybe the restaurant is hoping for the extremely generous types that likes tipping more than 20.
its exactly a month since i was here the first time.  i came back for take out and i was delighted by the food.i called late in the afternoon for pick up after their dinner opening time.  i ordered the trio of samosas called samosa teen tarike.  one was filled with green peas, one with potato, and one with paneer and corn.  the pastry was light and fried perfectly and the fillings were very tasty.  i really didnt need the sauces that were packed with thema mint sauce and a tamarind sauce.  both were good.for mains, i ordered chicken tikka masala for my wifespice level mildand i got the madras curry with chicken and spice level hot.  both were well done and the sauces were mild and hot as we both wanted.  we got two containers of basmati rice with the curries.i got a double order of garlic naan and it was as good as the first time i was here.  the order was packed perfectly for the short ride home and everything was hot when i opened the containers.a word about service.  navi took my payment and offered me a glass of water at the bar while i waited.  mr. patel, the owner, came out to speak with me as he had done when i was there before.  he is a very genial man and he lets his passion for his restaurant and the quality of the food he serves come out.  we chatted a bit about the patio being opened soon as the weather is cooling. ill be returning often.  again, i say im glad theyre a short drive from home and ill be back.
ive been on the hunt for a legit indian restaurant by my house. this place is it!! its a sit down style restaurant on the smaller side but very lovely. felt very clean  inviting. the food, oh my goodness, the food! it was very delicious  flavorful. we had the samosas as an appetizer, the pastry was light  crispy, the filling was very delicious. the dipping sauces were also wonderful, it came with a mint sauce  i dont know the name of the other sauce, it was sweet but yummy. we then had the tikka masala, saag  rogan josh. zero complaints about any of it. also got some naan bread  peshwari naan, very delicious as well. if you are craving indian food  your near the tropicana  fort apache area do yourself a favor and stop in for dinner. you wont regret it!
delicious!  what a wonderful treat!  i truly enjoyed my lunch with my friends.  the food was so good and beautifully presented.  i would definitely go back again and tell everyone to check it out.
best food in vegas. must checkout spot in vegas. great indian food. the cook is world class and the server was awesome.
this restaurant was fantastic. the food so good and fresh. omg and a bit spicy at some times. i would recommend keeping in mind this is meant to be eaten family style so be prepared to share with the table and bring a minimum of four ppl to order enough to try as many diff things as possible. we had 3 apps 4 entrees and 1 dessert. i normally dont prefer indian food. this place has changed my perspective. i will and want to return so as to support such great business in my hood. if your on the fence go here. if you have never tried indian food go here. i think you might be getting the point by now.

i love indian food and i love this place. we had the potato and pea samosas, garlic naan, tikka masala, lamb rogan josh, rice and masala chai for lunch. everything was amazing, decently priced and the service was awesome. highly recommended.
woua i love indian food and i will surely be back without all my kids restaurant is pretty, super clean and server was very courteous and serviceable.  food  was excellent and great presentation price very reasonable thank you :
just died and went to heaven. love this place.  everything in the menu is fantastic. also try a kingfisher beer.

delicious!!!!  everything was sooooooooooo good from the start....cheese stuffed nan my favorite to lentil soup the dinner was outstanding chicken tika masala and rogan josh back to cheese stuffed nan!!!lolwe will be back....also not to forget awesome service
this quaint little place is fantastic!  we were in the mood for something different and out of the ordinary. our server recommended some fantastic dishes. the chicken tika masala, garlic naan, and the lamb dish. they were all so amazing. for dessert we just couldnt decide what to have, again our server recommended a great choice! it was a mango smoothie and it was so good!
yummy lamb korma for 11 at lunch which includes garlic naan!
surprisingly very good place. new, clean, very tasty for reasonable price. we will come back.
since i left berkeley, i have not been able to find a good indian restaurant until now! their food is incredibly flavorful.  my personal favorites are the vegetable korma and the chana masala. the restaurant is colorful and has an inviting ambience. the service is impeccable and they are accommodating to different dietary needs.
came here for dinner based on yelp reviews and we were pleasantly surprised. who would have thought you could find genuinely great indian food in a strip mall in vegas?! we ordered the samosas and the chili paneer for apps. the samosas were good but not anything overly exciting. the chili paneer, however, was delicious! i mean, its hard to go wrong with fried cheese smothered in chili sauce. the sauce, by the way, was pure magic. our entrees were perfectly spiced. i was told the chef that night was timid with spice so i ordered my lentil soup and vegetarian dish spicy. it definitely had quite a kick but not so much that i couldnt taste my food. if the less timid chef is working i would probably stick to medium spice level. we also had a lamb dish rogan josh, i believe, and korma with shrimp. both entrees had complex and wonderful flavor and the lamb was so tender it was falling apart. the service was a bit slow and lacking but im not knocking them for it because there were only 2 servers and they were  swamped. they were hustling for sure.   prices were about average and the atmosphere was cozy. was this authentic indian food? to be honest, i wouldnt know. was it delicious?  yes. yes it was. better than any place we have tried back home in san diego. glad to see vegas isnt all corporate chains and mediocre food!
the food is amazing here.  unbelievable flavors!  so far ive had the samosas, chili chicken, chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, biryani, and garlic naan.  i love indian cuisine and have been to numerous restaurants throughout the valley.  these are the best samosas ive had in vegas.  i have yet to actually dine in, but i make togo orders at least once a week thanks to pregnancy cravings.  everyone who works there is always courteous. 
amazing meal. perfect everything. i had fish curry. great flavor a must eat place while in vegas.
absolutely faultless food  service.  the complex spice combinations of indian cuisine were done perfectly  the heatspice levels were just to our taste we requested medium heat.reasonably priced wine  cocktails, their signature mai tai was very good  when i requested an extra shot of rum, as i like a strong drink , it appeared instantly  at no charge!  we had the samosa, tikka masala, korma, garlic naan  the tandori roasted eggplant mash.we will definitely be back!
wow the food is amazing and being indian makes me more critical and theyve succeeded so well that every 2 days i go get the chicken dum biryani with a side of the garlic naan and am never dissapointed! ive shared a family meal as well with the goat curry and chicken tika and the amazing biryani of course which is sealed with a piece of naan to keep all the favors inside. so glad to have such a gem of a restaurant finally on this side of town.
im so glad to have stumbled on this gem in sw vegas.  sw vegas has pretty much been devoid of much indian food.  everything me and my buddy ate was amazing.  im primarily a vegetarian, but i will occasionally eat a little meat and had to try some of his chicken dishes.  ill start with the appetizers:chili panner: think of chunks of smooth cheese, almost cheesecurd like, in a sauce similar to kung pao, but obviously more complex.  delicious!  this will become a regular item for mechicken 65:  chunks of fried chicken in a thick tikka masalalike sauce.  need i say more? naan:  solid good ol garlic naanentrees...he had the chicken tikka masala which is of course a fairly common dish for us caucasians, but it was above average.  huge chunks of white meat chicken in an aromatic fragrant sauce.  i had the dal makhani which is sort of like an indian chili with lentils and red beans.  mind blown!  this was soooooo amazing.  i ate almost the whole portion which can be dangerous if you eat a large amount of lentils lol, but i couldnt stop.  i badly wanted to try the choco naan, but there just wasnt any room, so next time.
though it little far compared to other indian restaurants from strip, its worth visiting this place to eat. one of the best food i ever ate. good flavor, good presentation. somewhat less varieties, but the best.
heard that this place had the best indian food on the west side of vegas or all of vegas. so i came here for lunch today with my brother and i have to say, i loved it! everything was delicious from the veg trio samosa to the chicken tikka masala. chicken curry dish was tasty too. good size portions left me full. highly recommend this place. service was very friendly and place was clean.overall: a
very good ambience. tried right from the appetizers to the desserts. every single dish were so perfect.  5 stars goes particularly for their masala chai
the garlic nan is the best ive ever had. my boyfriend went as far as exclaiming it the best bread he ever had. make sure you get the mushroom side dish. its unbelievable. the service was amazing and the waiters knowledge of what on their menu was akin to my favorite dishes back in the uk made for me making all the right choices. will definitely be back
i experienced the best, for many reasons, in indian cuisine at curry leaf.  beginning with my two new friends navi  manish, the service is exceptional, the food is very good, the atmosphere is high end and the lunch menu is very well priced. i just had a wonderful lunch with appetizer all for under 18.00.  this place is great for both family and business lunches!
wow... just wow! curry leaf flavors of india is the real deal and deserves a visit from all foodies. ive enjoyed their food a few times now and havent been disappointed.service the restaurant is intimate and always clean. the staff is friendly and professional mostly. prompt and attentive i have been satisfied with their service from my first visit.food ive had several dishes here. tikka masala, chana masala, vindaloo, etc etc. everything has been great! the flavors are really well balanced and complex. the appetizers, are also great, chili chicken is my favorite! the naan is available in the usual flavors, and its always crisp and flaky on the outside, soft, tender and chewy on the inside. really great!i would suggest going for lunch. there is no buffet to try several items, but the ala carte entrees come with the naan of your choice and include basmati rice thats light and fluffy. all for around 1012they have a full bar, so might as well make it a two martini lunch while youre there!atmosphere the restaurant is intimate, yet colorful. there is booth seating on the perimeters and tables in the middle. there is enough space between all tables so that you dont feel like youre sitting in your neighbors lap and can feel comfortable to speak freely at a reasonable level with your company.all and all, i would feel comfortable having a casual date or business meeting here and have without any concern. well worth the visit!
yum yum yum. wonderful place. very casual. nice people. lovely decor. and the food! i enjoyed very much
yummmm!! friendly staff, great service and amazing food. we had the cauliflower gobi so good, the chicken tikka masala, the garlic naan and the chile chicken. the naan is lightly crispy and hot and delish, the food is so good and so conveniently located. love it here.
i came here with my family whilst on vacation, and we were surprised at the authenticity of the food. normally, when we go to indian restaurants we dont set our expectations too high as we know what real indian food should taste like. however, we were appalled at how good their food was, especially the saag. it tasted like we were eating in india, and my dad couldnt stop talking about it! the wait staff was also superb, and the chef actually came to talk to us personally. he genuinely seemed to care about the restaurant and his customers which topped off the whole experience!
rich did a great job resolving what we thought were some minor bee issues.  it turned out that we had an estimated 200 pounds of bees and hives across two joists under the eaves of our home. it was a big job and they were definitely up to it.
i highly recommend executive high reach for all your pest control needs. professional, knowledgeable and very helpful!
great company to work with. knows bees and how to keep them away. we had several costly incidents before we found this company and i would never consider anyone else.  i highly recommend them. got bees? get rich.
you could not ask for a more dependable, honest, fair, and allaround enjoyable person to be a part of your family because once you hire rich, you will want no others.  truly a gifted professional!
this is a amazing place to goi wasnt expecting to bump into a comic shop today but found this place and was amazed but how much great comics they have found 1 of the comics i been looking for about a month and at an amazing price couldnt belive the price and the customer service was very helpful and have great information i am totally coming back to this great place if ur in the area you should totally go check em out
great knowledge and service. fair prices and good selection on rare comics. all books in great condition if ever opened type quality. glad i came across this store.
when it comes to offprice retailing, i am a huge fan of swap meets. generally, these are outdoor affairs that offer a mix of new and used merchandise and lots of haggling. though i am typically not a fan of the vegas indoor swap meet version of shopping, there are exceptions to be made when the niche of merchandise is specialized andor requires a certain weather or atmosphere to properly display and merchandise. i have been a fan of comics and films since a young age and whenever a new shop opens in town i make my best efforts to go and check it out and assess the situation. arkham comics is a vendor located in an indoor swap meetshopping center off bonanza and charleston. the booth that they occupy is reasonably spacious and organized well. daniel, the proprietor, brings his passion for comics and graphic novelsfilms into his shop and is largely the reason why this review garners 55 in my opinion. a comic book store must employ truly passionate people in todays day and age. with the advancement of internet shopping, people have less and less reasons toactually venture out and purchase collectibles from a brick and mortar vendor. daniel and his wife are people that truly project an enthusiasm and passion for the merchandise and their collection. going from seasoned collectors to shop owners is a transition that often means inflated prices and super limited selection, but such is not the case here. their prices are extremely reasonable, comparable to ebay and amazon, but without the wait and the ability to chat with the owners about your own collection and the passions thereof. you can tell upon entry that daniel cares about his customers and his collection. he installed large fans above the entrance as the sue conditioning in the center is less than ideal. he is eager to discuss your collection and can even assist in locating harder to find collectibles. this shop can truly be considered a one stop shop for comic book collectors. my only wish is that the shop was in a better overall location. i think there are other indoor swap meets that might get more walkby attention or perhaps even a true brick  mortar storefront. of course, i do totally respect the need to keep overhead costs down, so at this point, word of mouth is their greatest form of advertising. overall, i strongly recommend arkham comics for anyone interested in a great atmosphere and merchandise that truly never gets old.
great guy very knowledgable about everything. he gave me some really good deals. knows a lot about grading and collecting. i was just in vegas on a trip and decided to stop by. im glad i did.
the first time i went daniel was very helpful,enthusiastic, energetic and displayed positive behavior.the prices on each comic book was very fair. i will be back to get more!
has a very organized display. every comicbook looks 9.8 grade. very well kept. daniel even told me all his books have never been openread and from the looks of them i believe him. i collect moderncurrent dc, he has more older stuff but i am definitely going back because the condition he has them in. priced very well too. willing to bargain is a plus. awesome comic spot.
very organized and very well kept. daniel help my brother and i by giving us some pointers i highly recommend arkham comics for a very reasonable price comics
excellent selection and pricing.i took advantage of the 1 buck or 13 for ten box box for some 90s goodness due to my daily budget but noticed the cost of his more expensive books were very fair.will come back when i can.
this is a very new doughnut shop that just open several weeks ago. so far the place is very clean and cozy. there are lots of parking spots out front. the customer service is very good, and the doughnuts are freshly baked every morning! ill have to come back to try this place out several more times.
i try not to eat doughnuts but  oh my gosh....delicious. also the coffee is a total hit. ive tried my 4 shot iced espresso and it was perfect.  also they have this thing called cafe du monde its a coffee blend coffee poured condensed milk, you can have it  hot or cold just amazing. the owners are really friendly too.  thank you sam and satia!

i just left the spot, second time here and this may be my new favorite donut shop! the owners are amazing, good selection of donuts and croissants and specialty donuts like froot loops! and they have a special going, 5.99 a dozen. get emm!
who doesnt love doughnuts??????passed by once or twice thought i will try one day..one day was today. came across a post on nextdoor and as described its a must. grand opening special 5.99 for a dozen,unbeatable price. great guest service and a perfect addition to the area.in the words of nacho libre lets get down to the nitty gritty! the selection: maple with bacon,jellies,cake,powered and so much more!!! fluffy,yummy,not greasy and fresh. this is my doughnut shop from this day forward
now i can have my cake and eat it too with the new neighborhood doughnut shop. the 5.99 grand opening deal is what caught my eye but when i walked in i was impressed. the small doughnut and coffee shop is located in a strip mall. there are a variety of beverages, coffee and milk to drink. along with some tasty pastries and of course doughnuts. from glaze, to fritters , cake doughnuts and all the tasty toppings. the staff are super friendly. very helpful and thank you for the business. there are tables and a large screen tv if you want to dine in.
i came in for the grand opening special  one dozen for 5.89 and couldnt wait to try one.  satia, one of the owners, made it a bakers dozen because she wanted me to try the blueberry old fashioned. i had ordered a ham and cheese croissant so while i was waiting her to warm it up in the oven i started sampling. the blueberry old fashioned was delicious! the perfect ratio of blueberries to donut. i tried the orange glazed french cruller next. it was this incredible mixture of crunch on the outside and  moist tenderness on the inside. the orange glaze was amazing. i am so glad i have another one for later! i ate every bite of my ham and cheese croissant which was warm and savory and the croissant was so flaky. their special price on a dozen goes till the end of the month. you have to try it!!
soooooooooooooooo amazing!!! i am so pumped that there is finally a legit doughnut shop in the area. the staff is super friendly and pleasant. there really are no words to describe the doughnuts here. they are all so amazing! the lemon filled is like a little cloud of heaven. so light! the french crueler....holy smokes! i wish i could eat 10 of them! i stopped in this morning and picked up 3 dozen! dropped some off at my daughters daycare and took 2 dozen in to work, i was totally the monday morning hero today! thank you northern perks!

a dozen of doughnuts brought me a good mood for the entire of the day.  its awesome!!!!!! 5.99 a dozen such a great deal ! my favorite is the blueberry old fashioned classic doughnut and chocolate topped buttermilk bar . omg friendly and helpful staff with patient. love my new neighborhood coffee and pastry cafe
i drove by northern perks during my morning commute and decided to check it out and grab a dozen donuts for the office. its a classic donut shop with a family business vibe. the man helping me was very friendly and let me pick out the variety dozen myself and even included, what i would consider, specialty donuts. speaking of specialty donuts... the gentleman helping me recommended the bacon maple donut. great recommendation! two coworkers split it and loved it! it was made with real, fresh bacon and i wished i wouldve gotten more than one so i couldve tasted it for myself. the donut that i did try was fantastic! i will definitely be coming back.
took my family to the shop for a snack and some coffee, the doughnuts were awesome and the service was top notch im glad to have this business in our neighborhood support local business its way better than dunkin doughnuts
oh my goodness! you guys, youve got to check out this spot! between my fiance and i, we tried the apple fritter, cinnamon crumbtopped cinnamon roll, chocolate buttermilk bar,  and a maple bacon glazed.  they were all stellar! the apple fritter and cinnamon roll were my personal favorites! they were unreal.  we went at 11 a.m. so,  i cant even imagine how delicious they wouldve been early in the day! : give it a shot! try a bunch of different kinds!
northern perks has been in business about a month. im glad i stopped in yesterday. delicious, madefromscratch donuts, great coffee, and a super friendly staff.
great new spot that manages to deliver on the standard varieties while also carrying some more adventurous stuff.  this might have supplanted bosa as my favorite doughnut in phx.
great donuts.  had the maple glaze with bacon.  delicious obviously...it has bacon; can i say anymore?  i eat donuts about once a year but this place will definitely be on my list to go back to if i ever get a craving again.
great selection of fresh made doughnuts, coffee and free wifi....good vibes here...you have to try the cinnamon swirl crunch its outta this world....
after reading all the good reviews these last few weeks, i finally made my way to the new northern perks doughnuts and coffee. i was not disappointed at all! i tried the maple glazed bacon and the regular glazed donut. the maple bacon was amazing, i have never had this flavor before, but one bite into this masterpiece  i was hooked. the glazed donut was pretty good, too. i will make my way to northern perks again soon!
delicious,  fresh,  donuts.  good coffee. super friendly owner and staff.  great little donut shop! will be back!
wow!!!!!! northern perks only opened 6 weeks ago and there is  a line at 9:15 in the morning. gotta have my favorite doughnuts
loved the donuts will gladly come back t are the best ive had. n phx. square oreo cookie donut is the bomb
q: so why did you open a donut shop?a: because i love donuts and there werent good ones here in our neighborhoodthat is pretty hard to argue with : lisa makes an amazing donut and runs a great shop. brought the kids here and they consumed one of everything. and lisa is so charming. definitely a happy place to come in the morning. marisa and i dont think twice about driving 40 miles round trip to here in the morning. opens at 4:30am too
split the powdered cronut w cream filling and apple fritter  cronut flaky outside aoft inside cream filling great..  apple fritter doughy ball of fried deliciousness.   new favorite doughnuts around.  delicious iced coffee and great 2 price.  owners are really nice!  im now addicted...
i read a review really early on sunday and then i saw the pictures of the donuts.  i had to try them.  i asked the kids who wants donuts?  of course, i got them all riled up, it almost seemed i had sugared them up already.  so i pack everyone in the car and we drove 22 miles to get donuts.  my little girl wanted the donut with the pink frosting and sprinkles.  my boy had the chocolate cake donut with chocolate frosting.  i had a cronut and my husband had a banana fritter.  we inhaled them, so we decided for round two.  i had a maple glazed and shared a croissant with my husband and my little girl had a white frosting with sprinkles this time.  we also took a 12 dozen donuts home, just in case we needed a little pick me up later that day.  the owners are really sweet and the donuts and croissants are amazing.  by the way, my husband also took a turkey and cheese stuffed croissant as his snack for the airport.  cant wait to make that 44 miles roundtrip trek again.
very friendly place. great selection of donuts.  i had the jalepeno ham and cheese croissant, it was really spicy and delicious.  the iced coffe was really good too.  if im ever back in this part of the valley ill definitely come back here.
visiting from la and promised the kids doughnuts. decided on northern after reading some yelp reviews and was not disappointed! doughnuts are light and fluffy with the tiniest bit of crisp on the outside. try the blueberry old fashioned  it is delicious! my daughter, who is always faithful to glazed doughnuts, said that northern perks glazed is one the best she has ever had. also spent about 30 minutes chatting with the couple that owns the shop and they are such lovely people and were very kind in giving us ideas on things to do in the phoenix area.
early saturday morning,started my day perfect with sweet red velvet doughnuts which is my favorite.the sunshine, favorite doughnuts and sweet decorations
i heard about this new doughnut shop from a friend, and had to go get myself a doughnut.  they have some unique flavors, doughnuts with crushed cookies, gummies... its wild!  i tried a red velvet with coconut sprinkles and it was delightful.  if youre in the neighborhood, go treat yourself to a doughnut and a cup of coffee.  the owners are super friendly!
great location. great and creative donuts.  great prices! and the best customer service ive received in a long time!
i was told i needed to try this doughnut shop out and i am glad i did. i love apple fritters and had to get one!  they had a pretty good selection and there are many more that i would like to try.  um... this could be a bad thing!  lol! staff was friendly and it is a great place to get coffee and a doughnut.
if this if the caliber of goodness theyre bringing after only being open two months, then id say northern perks has a bright future ahead.my husband and i stopped in on a sunday morning. we were the only customers inside at the time, but there was an older couple enjoying their purchase on a patio table out front. the woman working owner i assume was super friendly and helpful. she just lit up the room and you could tell she loved being there. the doughnuts were really top notch. the plain glazed would be almost indiscernible from krispy kremes in a side by side taste test, and to me, thats a heavenly thing. the glaze was light and flakynever too thick or eww damp like it sometimes gets. the cronut my first, im behind the times was tasty and crisp but the filling it had was a little bland. id like to see it done with a more interesting flavor. the lemonfilled doughnut was nice and tartjust what i look for, but if you prefer a sweeter lemon, it might not be for you. the boston cream doughnut was just that, creamfilled, not filled with a glorified pudding like some places offer. the ham, cheese, and jalapeno croissant was to die for. if you like spicy breakfast foods, that is, cause this thing was not messing around. i think it was my husbands favorite part of the trip, and thats really saying something, as he is a doughnut fanatic. he remembers the first time he ever tried one as a child. no lie. i also got an iced cafe du monde coffee, and although it was prepared a little differently than i had in good ol nola, it was outstanding. the chicory in the coffee is what really makes it stand out.do yourself a favor and stop inyou wont regret it!
awesome donuts. i am a donut snob and his place passes my criteria. the banana fritter was amazing filled with pieces of banana. the lemon had the right amount of tart filling. still many more to try. friendly service, very clean. a great addition to the neighborhood.
the reviews are exactly right.  this place has a good variety of donuts, i ordered 6 different flavors just to try and they all are yummy.  i loved the maple bacon.  coffee was fresh and the service was outstanding.
this place is great as good as it gets for a quick dozen and iced coffee to go.  would say that the donuts themselves rival the quality of my other favorite bosa but that they are even better because they come in even more varieties at northern perks. where else in town are you going to find square donuts topped with mms, cocoa puffs or even the wacky goldfish sprinkled donuts! they also have many versions of your usual standard for instance they didnt just have my favorite french crullers but they had them in multiple varieties from maple and chocolate topped to orange and cinnamon. they also stock the elusive maple bacon donut but make sure to come early as they sell out quickly.
wow. went in this morning after reading reviews on yelp and they didnt disappoint. you cant beat the friendly service where they make a habit of knowing their customers.  a guy walked in while i was getting my two dozen and he was greeted like an old friend since he dined there the past week.  the donuts were fresh and literally melted in your mouth.  i cant wait to go back!!
this has become a weekend musthave for my husband and i. fantastic donuts and the two ladies that work there are so nice. love this place!
wow!!!! northern perks now have smoothies and milk shakes! ill be here to enjoy my lunch everyday cuz there are also ice cream sandwiches and croissant sandwiches.lol.such a great place for lunch and breakfast.
this is a modest place in a generic strip mall, but definitely worth a visit. we got there a little too late on a sunday morning, 9 am, to try a cronut or some of the other specialties, but there was still decent variety. the ladies behind the counter were so friendly and greeted the locals as they came in, while thanking everyone else for their patience. we tried the raised chocolate with sprinkles, the apple fritter, red velvet, maple bacon and boston cream. they were all delicious! the apple fritter is super sweet, so be forewarned if that isnt to your taste. the maple bacon and red velvet were our favorites. the best part for me was the cafe du monde, the vietnamese iced coffee  delicious! they use the cafe du monde chickory coffee, so it is nice and strong, and then pour over sweetened condensed milk.
these doughnuts are so good! a bakers dozen is about 9 and they had lots of selection when i went. my favorite is a simple chocolate raised doughnut and i was not disappointed! definitely coming back for more!
why am i so early today? cuz i smell the doughnuts and coffee are waiting for me and i cant sleep and hang there anymore. so i decided to get some early doughnuts and coffee .i love to see the lovely  employees there! here i come
i hit this place once a week on my way to work to grab their fritters.  they have apple and banana which as a fritter lover just makes me a happy camper.  ive tried a few of the other donuts and they were decent as well.  give these guys a try, you wont be disappointed.
i came by northern perks when i was in the neighborhood due to their prior excellent review on yelp. unfortunately, at the time i didnt have my wallet on me, but i stopped anyway. the woman behind the counter insisted i have a donut anyway, on the house, just for stopping!the donut was great, but what really stood out was the customer service. thanks northern perks!for their sake, please do not take advantage of this and try to get a free donut.
these doughnuts are fresh! the staff is very friendly and always have a great variety as well.
hello beautiful sunday my favorite doughnuts and coffee shop is now serving seattles best coffee.and there are also pumpkins cake doughnuts .
awesome, got a box today and we all enjoyed it.  love supporting local and family owned businesses!  keep those yummy donuts rolling!  we recommend this place.
my coworker  i found this place while visiting phoenix. we thoroughly enjoyed the donuts! we tried the maple bacon, old fashioned blueberry, apple fritter, banana fritter, cinnamon sugar, and others my coworker at half of about 6 different ones!! the owner was friendly, outgoing and even threw in a couple extras for us to try out. the donuts were delicious! not overly sweet, but just right. i will definitely come back if im ever in the area again.
i was out of town for two weeks and now i cant wait to get my doughnuts and of course my favorite crossiant frank in a blanket. im so excited  to be here! the crossiant was so delicious and fluffy .
yum! maple glazed, pumpkin cinnamon sugar raised, oldfashioned blueberry glazed, orange glazed, maple bacon !, chocolate cake glazed, chocolate fruit loops and sprinkles, and donut holes! all on this mornings trip! plus, try their yinyang coffeetea. such an interesting mix of flavored! and their cafe du monde wcondensed milk is strong and tasty!
this place is a personal favorite of mine.  its right behind my apartment and always has fresh donuts every morning.  their maple boston creme and jalapeno ham and cheese croissant are my personal favorites.  their free wifi and peaceful ambience, along with free coffee refills make this place an ideal study space as well.
northern perks they are getting better everyday.today they just added the maple boston cream! its creamy, fluffy and rich yummy
awesome donuts freshly made daily oh so yummymy kids and i can taste the differenceso glad that they open 4:30 in the morning
this place is lockedon!  this guy didnt catch his name knows his stuff, is very personable, and gets the job done.  i came in today with a link needed to be added to a bulova watch and it took him less than 2minutes to do it... and for only 5!  the place is walltowall watchesclocks and you can tell that hes got a passion and a talent for what he does.  worth the trek down to his new location on 303 e woodlawn rd. allen
ive tried at least 18 flavors of wings and they are great as are their many side dishes, especially their cheese curds, homemade onion rings and sweet potato fries. their burgers are fantastic and service friendly.
stopped in today for their soft opening. the place is beautiful and its great to have a non casino steakhouse option in henderson. we sat at the bar and the owner came by to introduce himself. everyone was really nice and the service was great. i was also pleasantly surprised to see they have gaming and are nonsmoking. cant wait to come back and try dinner next time!
so glad this place opened finally! i couldnt wait to try it and im glad i did. lets start with outsidedecor  beautiful! they did such a great job. the inside with the litup bar and the exposed beams are exquisite! upon walking up, a hostess opened the door to welcome us. she even offered for us to look at the menu before taking a seat which was nice for people who may not be comfortable with steakhouse pricing. i, on the other hand, had already checked out the menu online and was ready to go!i am sorry we missed the live piano since we sat at 8pm. so few places have the live musicdining experience. i guess we will have to come back for happy hour! twist my armwe were lucky to have jeremy as a server and he was attentive while not hovering. i would definitely ask for him again when we come back! the food was delicious  grilled artichoke, bacon wrapped shrimp, wedge salad, porterhouse  all outstanding. the wine list is super reasonable we did a sauvignon blanc for less than 30bottle!. great date night place in our backyard! check out larsens!!
great service and a lovely restaurant! i really liked the bbq tritip and the maccheese!!!
i have been waiting for this nevada location to open and last evening my husband and i had our first experience.  the service was fantastic and when we return we will ask for david again.  started with the chopped salad, perfect and just the right amount of dressing.  i enjoyed the miso chilean bass and my husband had the porterhouse, both were cooked to perfection.  to end we shared their key lime pie and that completed one of the best meals we have had in a very long time.  locals please support this new and amazing restaurant you will not be disappointed.
great and a must try !! food and service was amazing !  great food variety even for non meat eaters. there is sushi salads steaks and tons more!!  beautiful inside and out...love  the decor and  bar area is big and gorgeous  outside seating is very nicely done .
my wife and i ate here yesterday and absolutely loved it.  great atmosphere!my wife had a glass of wine and i had a red ale on tap.we started out with the artichoke dip which was very good.i had the filet dry aged medium rare oscar style at it was amazing.  my wife had the filet wet aged and she love it too.  ordered the green beans and butternut squash which were both excellent.great date dinner place in henderson.  good job larsens.
i was very excited to finally visit larsens.  i was not disappointed.  our waiter neal was great and the manager ty was personal and professional.  we received great service.  we love the piano bar and the decor.  the new york steak was delicious and the tuna tartar appetizer is really big enough to be an entree.  we look forward to making this a regular place to dine.
first: i dont usually love steakhouses. and, im super hard on them when it comes to ratings as a previous manager of the range steakhouse at harrahs... but, this place really exceeded my expectations. lets start with the extremely attentive and friendly staff. from the guy who took my reservation over the phone, to the cute and smiley hostess, to the surprisingly knowledgeable server michael, down to the manager who checked on our table and thanked us again as we left do they think were celebrities?!.  we had the filet mignon sashimi appetizer served on the most decadent mashed potatoes, and it was wonderful. i would come back and order this as an entree anytime. we had the caesar salad... crispy and fresh lettuce, excellent dressing... simple and perfect. i had the dry aged 16oz. rib eye, medium rare... this thing was amazing. it had a perfect salty sear on the outside, and it was cooked to perfection. i got the 5 cheese mac  cheese to go with it... divine. my friend had the miso glazed sea bass.... holy cow. it was huge! moist and flakey inside, crispy on the outside.  served on a massive bed of rice that was covered with the most delicious creamy sauce... dont even know what it was, but i would pour it on my cereal, it was that good. overall, go here. youll be impressed.
welcome to my neighborhood larsens. i will be the first to say i am very happy to have a semi upscale steakhouse in the area. my first visit, i was quite under dressed and had no idea what to expect. however i was welcomed, and had a great experience. trip 2, was a double date, and being dressed appropriately, ordering the best steaks, and a round of cocktails gets you a personal visit from the owner, and a  dessert on the house. i have been lucky enough to try the dry aged filet, the prime rib, the ribeye, the herb crusted chicken, the wedge salad, the chili also made with filet, the bacon wrapped shrimp, the mash potatoes, and mac and cheese. for dessert i have tried the peanut butterchocolate pie, the apple pie, and the creme brulee.i would order every single item again. it was all high quality, fresh food. the extensive knowledge by the server is an added plus to an already great atmosphere. there is a beautiful and huge balcony for outdoor dining. even the bathrooms were luxurious, offering sprays and mouthwash. the service has been spot on both visits. very attentive and friendly staff. i have intentions of being a regular here. even if its just for a quick happy hour cocktail.
amazing food!!! my second time here and both times the food was great and the service was second to none! the drinks are all wonderful! i highly recommend this place.
great food. the meat is sooo go and tender!!! cant wait to go back. we love the large windows.
nice atmosphere, casual yet classic. food was great i had the filet well done and it was cooked. also had baked potato and maple glazed carrots both very good. my friend had the crunchy lobster roll and said it was good. for the price you cant beat the service and the food.
thank you a great steak and great service, best meat candy ive had in a long time.  thank you for opening up a location here, this area needed something a little upper scale.  and thank you for not being in a smoky casino.
very good lunch and finally something new at the galleria mall. had the lobster roll and it was amazing, also their hamburger called the burger was so tasty and juicy.
great service. patio was excellent to eat lunch with my 2 year old date. wish they had some fruits though. from the host, excellent welcome. the server, i forgot her name, was on it. she made sure my drink is never empty. always checking up on us. great suggestions for the meal. good customer service and her assistant was also excellent. prices for steak are excellent, better then the station casinos or other steak house around the neighborhood. hopefully the management takes care of the servers because servers makes customers come back. there are thousands of steak house, but when your server is excellent, people return for that place.
our first experience here was in june for my mothers birthday.  while i cannot recall our servers name, we were greeted immediately and got drinks very quickly.  he also provided excellent recommendations on appetizers and entrees.  for appetizers we went with the lobster crunch roll and the bacon wrapped shrimp, and let me just say that they were both so amazing i almost wished i would have just ordered one of each for myself instead of sharing.  we had the following entrees; chardonnay salmon, roasted chicken, and tri tip, while i didnt get to try all of them there was definitely no complaints.  aside from the food the service was incredible, never was there an empty drink or dirty dish, on top of that every employee in the restaurant seemed to genuinely love their job and actually wanted to ensure that we had a great dining experience.with our first meal being such a wonderful experience when my husband was setting up a business dinner, we immediately thought of this place.  while there on our first visit we noticed a private room with approximately enough room for 14, about a week or two later we walked into larsens to check and see if we could make a reservation for 12ppl for the private room.  the hostess went and got the manager for us and he personally booked the private room for us.  we arrived for our dinner on friday, and while i could go into the whole experience and how amazing it was, that would take a lot of typing.  everyone enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere so much that about 5 hours later after far too many drinks, food, and talking we didnt even realize that they were actually trying to close.  however, the reason we did not notice was because they did not come in and try to force us to leave in anyway...in fact they were still making sure we had drinks and anything else we needed!!!  the following day, my husband actually got a call from larsens to ensure that our evening went well, i didnt even know restaurants did this?!!  well done larsens.  if your looking for great food, service, and atmosphere please put this restaurant at the top of your list to try.  we will be back soon.on a side note, i actually signed up for yelp just to write this review.
let me start by saying, i was very impressed.  we went at about 7pm on a tuesday and it was not crowded at all.   i think even if it was, the service would have been excellent, however.we started off with a couple chopped salads...and wow!  easily in the top three of salads ive ever had.  generous portions of avocado, artichoke hearts...and like ten other things with the blue cheese dressing perfectly tossed in.  if i was in a salad mood, i may well come here just for this...goodbye to sweet tomatoes forever!i enjoyed the full rack of pork ribs and can say with confidence it was one of the best ive ever tried.  very generous trimming and falling off the bone slow cooked tender with excellent sauce.  one side included, i chose the five cheese macaroni, in retrospect a pretty bland choice, but it was nicely prepared for what it was with bread crumbles on top.my girlfriend had the wet aged filet mignon with creamed spinach as the side.  the steak was perfection and the spinach was a very generous portion.all in all it was an excellent experience.  the decor of this new restaurant is over the top great.  this would be a great place for a date.
this is my new go to steakhouse close to home. larsens is everything that i wished hanks would be and finally fills that spot for a good steakhouse without driving to the strip. all of the staff and our waiter were very welcoming. you can tell that they are a new business and that they are eager for your business. we came to eat dinner in the dining room, but noticed that the bar area had a nice crowd for happy hour. after looking at the happy hour menu i think id like to come back and give that a try as well.we started by sharing a spicy tuna roll and an old fashioned. the roll was very good and a pretty good size roll. it didnt strike me as overly spicy. i liked the ponzu sauce that came on the side. the old fashioned here is made with rye whiskey and definitely packed some punch so we really enjoyed it. i had the ribeye which was very flavorful. it was slightly less tender than my usual filet, but still pretty moist and well seasoned. the fattier cut definitely made it more flavorful. for my side i chose sweet potato fries and they were awesome. another well seasoned item with a bit of crisp to it. my husband had the hawaiian marinated tritip. the flavor was really good and he loved it. personally, the cut isnt my cup of tea, but it was well prepared for someone that would enjoy that cut.we wrapped up with a slice of key lime pie. it was okay. their take on the pie is more like a buttermilk pie with a lime glaze on the side instead of the typical tangy key lime pie. i think next time i would try the apple pie. this spot is definitely a gem for the area. im so glad to have a great option close to home.
if yelp had 6 stars, id give them 6.  i come to town from los angeles quite often to do business in henderson.  normally id have to go way south to dine, as im a bit of a food snob.  ive been to larsens a few times now and have to say, its fantastic.  impeccable service and incredibly prepared food.   the steaks are top quality.  boy do they make a great martini.their patio looks south over the new fountain and patio areas and because it is elevated, it has fantastic views of the valley to the south.  the sound of the waterfall adds to the ambiance.   it may seem this place isnt open, as there are additional restaurants around it getting ready to open.  larsens grill is a must for all those in henderson.  so nice to see this shopping center stepping it up.
we live in henderson and honestly, we have to drive towards the strip or summerlin if we want a great tasting steak for dinner. we decided to try larsens last week and enjoyed our meals so much that we came back tonight for another try. on our first visit i had the wet aged filet and my husband had the dry aged ribeye. both were flavorful but if you enjoy the grill flavor and marbling order the ribeye. the filet is fork cutting tender...you dont need a knife to cut it and more mild in flavor. leftover, the filet was just as good. tonight we shared a wedge salad which was amazing and the filet mignon sandwich with the macaroni and cheese. enough food for both of us and we were stuffed. i didnt really enjoy the apple pie though. looking forward to trying the key lime pie next time. well be weekly regulars!! jeff is the best server! hendersons hidden gem.
food was very good, prices very competitive. the wait staff was very friendly and efficient. my wife even received a follow up call asking how our visit went. not many places do that. definitely worth a visit. we will be back.
tried larsens friday night and it far exceeded expectations. dry aged filet mignon was as good as it gets. thai salad had a nice flavor and generous amount of steak. creme brule was above average, but key lime pie was outstanding! on top of all that, the staff was first rate. this place seems very well managed and attentive to detail. what a great addition to galleria!
loved this restaurant super good food , great service . great management good job guys
we were looking to try something new in the area and wandered in. im not a food snob, but i am a picky eater, so new places scare me.i wasnt looking for a 200 dinner, so we ordered the prime rib french dip and the filet sandwiches. we commented that we were going to split them so we could try them both. the waiter was excellent and had them plated that way for us.i liked them both very much. i liked the filet sandwich best. the mixture of flavors are just right. we finished the meal with cheesecake that was fresh and amazing. my husband was fond of the selection of whisky.i recommend trying this restaurant! they are upscale from outback but not as fancy as hanks.
first visit here and will definitely return!  excellent food, service and ambiance.  the crab cakes were the best i have ever eaten!
the spirit of true hospitality is such an important part of a good dining experience, and larsens seems to really understand that. we had heard of this place opening but had no expectations when we decided to check it out on an afternoon trip to the galleria. after figuring out where to enter the remodel on the front side of the mall is really nice we saw that they close between 2:00  5:00 pm...and it was literally 1:55. as we walked up an employee was exiting and very cheerfully let us know we had time to be seated and it wouldnt be a problem. having been in the industry for quite a few years, i was a bit skeptical. its not cool to come in minutes before closing! but, the hostess had the same cheerful and sincere attitude, assuring us that it would be their pleasure to serve us. sadly, i dont remember her name, but she was super welcoming. our server sharde! was also genuinely friendly  cheerful, as well as striking a perfect balance between being attentive and letting us be.we started with cocktails, and my husband was thrilled with the handstuffed blue cheese olives in his martini we plan to return for happy hour, especially when it cools off a bit; theres a great patio area. as for food, we shared steamed mussels and a lobster roll with grilled asparagus, all beautifully presented and yummy.second visit was with some girlfriends for dinner, and again the hospitality vibe was on and the food was quite good. happy hour apps, we tried the meatballs meh, but that wasnt my pick, not my favorite thing and crab cake delish then got seated for dinner. i had the thai noodle salad, which was really good. it had quite a bit of greens and not so much noodles, which was a positive in my book. i got to taste everyone elses food too: seared ahi tuna salad, dry aged filet mignon, and cedar plank salmon, unanimously enjoyed. the server was funny and very nice, unfortunately im blanking on his name; the only misstep was when one friend ordered a glass of wine after we has finished a couple bottles, 2 different pinot noirs he brought a completely wrong wine, a chard.....however, this cant really be counted since she didnt let him know! im sure he would have cheerfully taken it back and brought the right one. life is too short to drink the wrong wine!
larsens is an awesome addition to the henderson area!  loved the bar decor and the ribeye and crab cake are amazing .  great experience overall.
first time diners and super impressed.  excellent service, super fast and meals were delicious!
if you are looking for dining alternatives, we finally have a steak place outside of the casino restaurants that is worthy.  larsens is very, very good.a. ambiance and decor is top notch. great location, parking, nice and attractive entry way!b. service  from the reception desk to the host to the server, excellent and first class.c.  food  we skipped the appetizers and went right for the meat. the dry aged filet was very, very good. i ordered it blue and while i like it more rare, it came out more medium and it was still tasty. i did not complain at all as it was still tasty. the rib eye was very tasty and full of flavor from the nice marbled fat that was also aged 28 days. friends had the filet and the stuffed chicken. they said that the stuffed chicken was the best they had ever!d.  desserts  my ole my. i had the peanut fudge cake and ate all by myself.  each of us had a dessert and we were very, very happy.e.  good drinks and good fun.  gk says check it out.
our sever was awsome.  food was great. very nice decor. will def come back. we ordered the artichoke stuffed chicken. was very good and the creme brulee was the best. good wine selection and reasonable prices.
we just had the best dinner; i cant decide which my favorite was.  tried the dry rub rib eye, pork chop, prime rib dip sandwich, and key lime pie, dutch apple pie and creme brule.  everything was fabulous, the sweet potato waffle fries where outstanding and the key lime pie was one of the best we ever had.the service was just wonderful, we will be going back and the prices were not that bad for a steak house.
its so nice to have a great steakhouse close to home without the drive to our favorite places near the strip. our waiter neal went above and beyond to make our first experience there a good one. the filet and rib eye were on par with our favorite steak houses so i would definitely recommend larsens to others out looking for a something new near home.
perfect steaks, amazing service  friendly but unobtrusive. great happy hour menu. this is an amazing restaurant.
we had a great time and this place had amazing food! our server was very attentive and had great suggestions to us. we will be back to try the steaks. i had the filet asian salad. it did have a lot of noodles in it, so didnt exactly taste as healthy as i was looking but that wasnt their fault. thanks :
we had a great experience here for our first time and it being a new restaurant in the neighborhood. we sat outside on patio and the ambiance was great. i love how they have fire pits and tv, great for football days. our server was neil and he was great very attentive, recommended all the right stuff. it was my dad and my bday celebration dinner and they have us both cards signed by the staff, that was very thoughtful! the sea bass was amazing, fish thick cut tasted real clean. miso sauce on rice was a plus! the porkchop was great too, tasted like a steak! it was huge but tender. my dad ordered the porterhouse it was cooked nicely but tasted bitter to us, must have been the grilled onions and mushrooms on it? overall drinks and food were so good! we will return again esp for happy hour. the menu for happy hour has something for everyone, includes wedge salad which was also very tasty.
even though there are hundreds of top quality restaurants in las vegas, larsens delivers with outstanding service and great menu selections. i usually have a couple items on a menu that interest me, but it was a tough choice because there were many items that looked excellent.   i had the chilean sea bass while my wife enjoyed a filet.  both were excellent and cooked to perfection.  neil did a great job, and was always there when we needed him.  he knew the menu and specials, and was very professional in handling our table.  we sat outside on the deck area, which was very nice.  i highly recommend this restaurant, and neil as a waiter.  it was my first visit, buy i will definitely return.
i was quite pleased with my first visit to this establishment.  giant bacon wrapped shrimp made for a nice juicy start, followed by a very tasty caesar salad with large elongated anchovies.  but, as most diners would probably prefer, the highlight of the meal was the entree of surf  turf.  here i was presented with a buttery 8 oz. mediumrare prime filet and a 78 oz lobster tail that was noticeably sweet.  this hot land  sea duo, augmented by delectable mushrooms and drinkable bearnaise sauce, along with fine house cut fries that were soft on the inside and a little crisp on the inside, was clearly a match to what is served up at the best highend steak houses on the outside.for dessert a hot fudge sundae had a surprise brownie on the bottom!  the setting was fireplace casual but with a sense of refinement.  table service was very good.  and other restaurant staff members were very hospitable toofrom initially accepting a reservation by phone, through greeting my party of four upon arrival, seating us with a smile, and bidding us a cheerful farewell upon our departure.i only wished i had ordered a second lobster tail instead of splitting one with diane.  next time i surely will!
the first time we dined here for dinner we noticed that there was quite a crowd in the bar area for happy hour. clearly we were missing a good time. on veterans day we came again for dinner, but when we walked in i remembered the happy hour. i was able to talk my husband into giving it a try and im glad that i did. for those that are on the fence like my husband was, you can also order a meal in the bar area if someone prefers a meal over happy hour. even though we were in the bar area the service didnt suffer a bit. our waiter was attentive and friendly. he checked on us several times and the food came out quickly. at the end of our meal he even noticed a small pin my husband was wearing and asked if he was a veteran. my husband said that he was. when we got our check it reflected a veterans day discount. this was really nice because my husband isnt the type to ask for a discount. thank you for recognizing a special day to us and to many.from the happy hour menu we ordered prime rib sliders, macaroni and cheese, steak tacos, and buffalo chicken potato skins. the prime rib sliders were amazing and definitely the best item we had. the meat was tender and just juicy enough. i liked the ciabatta bread that it was served on as well. the sliders came with au jus and horseradish, but they didnt require anything additional. the macaroni and cheese was okay, but not the best of the items we ordered. i should mention that it had blue cheese which was fine with me since i love it, but a huge problem to my husband that hates it. the steak tacos were a second runner up to the sliders. they were delicious and cooked with well seasoned onion and mushrooms. so good. the buffalo chicken skins were good had plenty of chicken and a good amount of cheese without overpowering the other flavors.the portions were generous for a happy hour and very reasonably priced. this is definitely now on our list of regular spots for both dinner and happy hour.
went to larsens for the first time and i can say had a great dining experience,  our waiter micah provided excellent service, explaining everything in regards to the menu, food was excellent, would definitely come back.
one of my favorite food spots in vegas! always perfectly cooked steaks with friendly service. great location for henderson locals and the venue and overall atmosphere are excellent.price is fair for the somewhat higher end dining experience.great overall value.
great herb roasted chicken, same for the carrots and mashed potatoes. beautiful room with great service, very enjoyable dinner without any feeling of being rushed. wifes salad was great, all produce was very fresh in taste and appearance.
i would give this place ten stars if i could...we had happy hour in their bar, my first time to larsens grill. i live in henderson and my friend suggested going there for a glass of wine. i am so sorry it took me this long to discover this place!!! we had the steak tacos 10 and prime rib sliders which came with au jus for dipping and a wonderful horseradish sauce on the side, a lovely salad and several glasses of their house cabernet. to say it was outstanding is an understatement. the steak, grilled mushrooms flavor was incredible and like velvet in the mouth. wow...there were about four people in the bar taking care of us, each one coming up to see how we were doing....our server was brianna and she is the one who suggested the steak tacos. excellent service!! she even offered to take us on a little tour to see their private dining room. it was beautiful, cozy and warm with dark wood walls and beautiful chandeliers. another nice touch was all the small red pointsettia plants on the tables and the christmas tree was decorated with real class.the bar reminded me of places i used to go in seattle. kind of like the cheers bar with dark wood walls, small booths where you can dine, and really pretty lighting.i cant wait to go back and will be bringing all of my friends to be sure...
we had the filet mignon sandwich, turkey melt with sweet potato fries and the steak chili as a starter. our server micah was wonderful and suggested red onions with the chili. it was a tasty addition.  i believe the sweet potato fries to be the best in town! everything was so delicious and fresh. we cant wait to come back!
everyone at lane splitters are super nice, and they definitely know their way around a motorcycle. so if you need some repairs or need some mods done to your bike i highly recommended lane splitters!
i dropped my 2007 sportster off to be completely overhauled. the staff is amazing. they produced the most beautiful bike youve ever seen! they offer quality work with reasonable prices.
let me start off by saying that i am so pleased to be writing this review. miguel and the rest of the guys at the shop are not only over the top professionals  but also an awesome group of guys and it shows with their tremendous customer service. i called them after reading their reviews online because my bike was having electrical issues. miguel was extremely friendly and told me that he cant promise anything since its a metric and it could be a ton of different things but to bring it down and theyd try their best to fix it for me. i appreciated the fact that he didnt try and over promise and under deliver just to make a quick buck like a lot of shops do. with that said  not only did they completely fix my electrical problems they also made some other adjustments which were needed and i didnt even have to ask for. after having my bike back for a week now i can honestly say its running better then ever! i would recommend these guys to anyone and on a side note the shop is super cool and they have all kinds of great merchandise. thanks guys ill be back!
my 2012 victory had an issue with the rear tire and these guys got me in right away and took care of me. very friendly staff, cool building, good service and prices. i will be back.theyve been there about a year and im sure for many to come.
i got in an accident trying to miss hitting a cat that jumped out in front of me.  it was my first accident on the bike and i didnt know where to go to get my wheels fixed.  i jumped on yelp and lane splitters had some great reviews! ill tell you this....best decision i ever made.  these guys were on it! fixed my bike, kept me informed during the whole process. they also went above and beyond trying to get my bike back to me as they new i would be starting a new job and i would be without wheels.  this company cares.  ill always come here for my biking needs.  every single person there was kind, knowledgable and you knew that they wanted to help you. miguel, brian and rudy were great!  thanks again guys!
this location is very convenient. they have excellent smoothies.. and fast friendly service. i would recommend this location to everyone
i went here for the first time yesterday.  it was through the drive thru because i was short on time.  i ordered a peach smoothie and a blueberry smoothie for my lady.  i loved it.  i also ordered the spinach feta wrap was was awesome.  if your looking for this place you may spend a few minutes looking for it because it seems a little tucked away.  honestly it looks a little deserted from the outside.  if i had to rate it on the appearance alone it would be below a 1 star but honestly the smoothies and wrap were delicious.  its open 24 hours.  i can see myself going back again.  the end
if you have any tire needs, go here. very friendly, honest and knowledgeable staff.  so you dont have to worry about your vehicle or rims being damaged. comfortable waiting area. easy to find and access.
we were in vegas for the weekend and got a flat. found this place on yelp. conveniently close to the strip and easy to find. friendly, hard working, and efficient staff. got our tire patched up quickly and for  a decent price. definitely recommend this place especially in a pinch!
great tire place in vegas right off the strip! i had a slow leak driving cross country but now its fixed. they also had a lot of odd sized used tires, one in my size too which i thought i would need. my tire was able to be repaired saving me some much needed extra vegas cash! when it comes to an honest tire shop with fair prices in las vegas look no further! knowledgeable and friendly staff, and very easy to find!
the best service hands down , nice and genuine man. i wish jr. the best in life , may god bless you with heath and love and happiness  you are great soul .
art is really fair! has great used tires! professional and always wants to help and give great advice too!
both times here have been great. pollo asado is what i always look for and i had a torta and a california burrito, both great. my man loves the carnitas burrito with rice and beans. best part is the excellent service. definitely check it out.
yummy in my tummy : i have been looking for good mexican food since i moved here and i believe i have found it! everyone working there is so sweet and helpful, and very funny.  right down the street from my work, and near my house also. my coworkers and i love to stop in for lunch. thank you guys so much!
ive seen many food places come into this location and not do well cause of the poor food quality and many other issues but this place is different. the staff is always extremely helpful and polite, the prices are truly unbeatable and all the prices on food are including tax which makes things alot simpler. i wanted to give this place a try regardless of the food quality simply cause of how polite and kind the people running it treated me. later on i found out that the food is very good, id even say some of the best authentic mexican food ive had in a while here in vegas. i highly recommend giving this place a try.
the customer service was excellent! the food was straightforward and delicious, so i highly recommend jefes taco shop.
stopped by here on a whim one day realizing there was a taco shop in my area.   upon my entrance i was welcomed by ben and blanca owners who took time to explain the menu and also some background on the business.  i felt very appreciated as a customer.  i ordered the california burrito and it was huge!!  the flavor was amazing and reminded me of the taco shops back home in san diego.  come to find out thats where they were from too.  the carne asada was tender with a slight grill flavor. i could only finish half the burrito but it was so delicious that i stuffed the other half down an hour later.  take the time to stop by jefes and you will not be disappointed!!
their food is on point  asasa fries are a must!! not to mention great customer service ;
well i happened to stumble a pond this place after seeing some wonderful views here on yelp,and i must admit i was very impressed,i had a wonderful convo with the cashier who was very kind,i had the 3 mini carnita tacos just to try and my stupid self got the food to go so when i got home i ate the tacos,and i  honestly can say they were the best carnita tacos ive had in vegas,i wish i wouldve got more food..lol
the best southern california style mexican food in vegas. love their sauce s.!  california burrito is my favorite.
stopped by on the way out of town. eric was super friendly. had breakfast burritos. green sauce is killer and the red is nice and hot. you cant go wrong!!!!!
their food is delicious and decent priced! close to where we live which is a major plus! we got the asada nachos which were huge, california burrito which was huge as well,  and asada mini tacos all were very good! the sauces were good as as well. way better than all the other mexican places around. i just wish they had the carrots!
this place is really good.  worth it to stop in and meet manny he is super friendly and great customer service speaks english very well.  this is a family owed business and they take pride in there product. which is amazing. my husband got the chimichanga burrito. i got the adobda mini tacos and the rolled tacos. great mexican food.  you know its good when mexicanas eat there.  when we came up two little ladies of mexican descent where there we asked them how the food was and they said  this was their second visit this week.  im mexican as well as my spouse so no disrespect intended. the food was ample portions for the price manny did say there was going to be a price change but better quality meat. hopefully those price increases wont be too high.  overall good quality food for the price and definitely will be back.  also with your yelp check in you may be able to get a free drink.  its 100 honored here and manny gave us a free refill.
awesome place. ordered the carne asada tacos and were some of the best ive had, great flavor. the carnitas were killer too, with a nice little crunch how i like it. manny is a great host. cant wait to explore the menu further.
if i could give these guys more than 5 stars, i definitely would! their service is amazing, the place is very clean, and i finally found a place where they make california burritos the right way.  i came from san diego and since i moved here, ive been missing the way mexican food is in sd and now i have a favorite place to go whenever im missing cali. i had a very good first visit, and i will definitely come back again very soon! keep it up!!
i was visiting my brother and he doesnt cook and i didnt want to... i saw jefes here and since it was close thought id give it a try. ben owner? told me to get on yelp and tell about the lousy service and bad food.  i can not tell a lie ben. so ill say how great the sevice was and holy buckets the size of my chimi!  plus it was delicious!  the seating is very limited so i had to take it out as the table was occupied.  i got back to my brothers and opened the carton and my remark was as stated above.  i dug in and was barely able to finish it along with the rice and beans.  but i cant let good food go to waste...  i wish them the best on their business venture and ben on his buick restore.  if youre ever in alamogordo ben... open one here!
pleasantly surprised with the food and service.  talked with ben and manny and the service was probably something you would expect at a nice steakhouse.  they greet you like your family and small talk with you while the food is being prepared.  the service was fantastic and couldnt say anything negative it really caught me off guard as i was expecting something similar to robertos.  the food was amazing i ordered the pork fries.  the pork was packed with flavor and the size is out of this world.  overall 55 for service and 55 for food.  next time you are thinking of getting some food in the area definitely give this place a try!
i enjoyed this.  when i came in, the owner educated me on the food.  now i have some experience with the food.  well in the last year i have ate at probably a dozen taquerias in town and had home cooked mexican food perks of dating a mexican.  i wanted to just hear the speel to see where their heart was at.  its in the food!  tortilla lightly cooked for that texture you need.  street tacos are simple enough, meat onions and cilantro.  the carne was well seasoned and marinated.  adoba was great.  even some of the sweetness was still in it.  nice and blackened for that crunch.  they use lard which does make a difference.  that is an important quality in any mexican kitchen.  only thing to say is the red sauce was amazingly hot... manny did not lie.  it is a straight chili sauce so dont pour it everywhere thinking its taco bell.  closest to eating my fiancee cooking without asking her to do so.  keep it up.  mr. roberto will be happy to see the legacy continue.
im so glad i checked yelp today! i was browsing around yelp for something to eat in the neighborhood to see what i was feeling. well if you know me, i am always down for mexican and when i saw this new name i had to check it out! very glad i did. the girl was sweet and asked me if i was interested in becoming a regular. all they needed was my name. i gave her my name and she right away started addressing me accordingly no impersonal maam or miss, but by my first name. she asked how i found out about their place and let me know that they are all about customer service  which i could absolutely tell. the food was super on point too!!i ordered adobada fries which comes in two sizes super size 9 and their bigger one  12. it was flavorful, the meat was delicious, and it had a lot of it as well as fries! not too much beans too which i liked. anyways, definitely recommend anyone to try it! its located inside the sinclair gas station, so it might be easy to miss.
we also checked yelp for mexican. i filtered for 5 star and jefes came up. my mom and i drove to the sinclair to check it out. just as stated before,  they ask you your name and if you want to be a regular. the staff was courteous and ben, the manager,  was on his a game with customer service!  the food is excellent, and well definitely be back! ! try it for yourself and see what you think!
i came here after three coworkers recommended it. ben was friendly and really concerned with our happiness with the food he served. i got the chicken rolled tacos combo and my wife got the chicken tamale and chicken taco combo. this was the best quick mexican food ive ever had here in vegas. highly recommend. we will be back!
top notch customer service!!! while at the counter, manny was speaking with other customers and he quickly replied sir, ill be right with you in a moment. this is good customer service right here and the acknowledgment goes a long way. i ended up getting the carne asadapollo asada tacos and the rolled tacos. they are generous with their portions, fair with their prices and the food is absolutely delicious. manny also took the time to offer me one of their beverages and discussed a brief history of the business. they really care about their customers and go out of their way to make you feel at home. the location is inside a gas station so dont let that deter you from giving them a try. i have found my favorite mexican restaurant in vegas and ill definitely be returning. thank you manny!
absolutely the best. best service. best food. best quality. clean and cleaner. definitely not what you would expect in a gas station. but you need to try this place. talk with ben. hes fantastic.
great little place to eat. i found them on yelp and decided to give them a try. i was so amazed by the service and the food that i went back later in the day to try something else on the menu. i met the owner that evening and he explained that they were all from socal and the history of the food prep. it definitely tastes like something you would get from a mom and pop shop in san diego. i highly recommend this place. my favorite part of the two dishes ive tried so far is the rice, it was definitely made with love.
first of all, holy crap, they are up front and personal with everyone in the best way. they put customer service first and i really respect the energy here. everything feels so personal, 1010 would 10 again.not to mention the food is pretty well done too. theres a lot of care put into this place. it feels like this is one of those starting out family restaurants.i highly recommend it. i hope this place gets big.
so amazing... as a local my whole life, i havent seen an equal competitor in my area. i just ate a full meal, still want more. dont think about it, just go.
wow! i never write a review before, this will be my first but let me tell you guys how i love this place. very good customer service and food was great. i was craving for  some burritos so my husband yelped out some good mexican place so he came across to this place so we decided to try it out with our kids and let me just tell you it was the best mexican place here in vegas we ever encounter. manny was very nice and easy to take order from, he really made us feel comfortable and welcomed. thank you! we will be coming back soon...
located inside a gas station, jefes has two tiny tables in the back and a counter where you can order some seriously excellent food.  manny told us it was all cooked san diego style, which ill have to take his word on because i havent been to san diego to eat yet.whatever the explanation is, im glad jefes is close to home so we can eat here often.  and this is from me, who isnt a big fan of mexican food. hubby is a big fan, and he loves the place also.  in fact, ive never seen him devour refried beans like he did there and going into poetic rhapsody whenever he had to come up for air.he had a couple of fried tacos and loved them. i had the 3 pork mini tacos and they were so overloaded with meat that i separated the two taco shells and halved the filling into each part so it became six tacos which was good because hubby also ate half of my tacos.weve already been back twice and thats pretty rare for us, we like to always explore and try new stuff. however, sometimes a place is just too good not to return to, and jefes is one of those.
would like to leave 6 stars but i guess 5 will do. great food especially the steak fajita plate. yum! the most friendliest service in town! will be back!
oops got here at 8:08 this morning and they werent ready to serve breakfast burritos sorry would have liked the breakfast burritos from jefes today.
definitely way better than robertos or any other taco shop....portions are huge and awesome customer service!
bomb. if your looking for a bomb pick up and go taco spot its hear. customer service if excellent. when i seen the reviews i wanted to check it out when i got their i was a little like really, when i seen the prices i thought a little expensive for tacos and burritos. so i ordered the asada burrito when it came out it was twice the size as a regular taco spot  robertos pepes and the meat was cooked fresh havent seen that before and it was perfect, taste was on point. this will definitely be my taco spot from now on. bomb
incredibly friendly service right off the bat, ben makes you feel like a valued customer and friend.  food is all reasonably priced as well.  i got the chorizo and egg combo platter, which came with an absurd amount of outstanding food for only 7.50, easily enough for two meals.  plus, i got a free horchata for checking in on yelp.  hell give you free refills if you dine in, and if youre taking your food to go hell top off your drink before you go.  im definitely coming back!
ingredients  10 homemade sauces; rice and beansauthenticity  10 serves special dishes such as cabeza  lenguacustomer service  11 food  10  fuckin great food
full disclosure: i only ate the deliciousness of jefes, i didnt personally interact with any of the employees or go into the restaurant. with that being said, yum! seriously, sooo good!my husband went and picked up dinner for us last night while i stayed home with the babe. he came home and told me how friendly everyone there was while we inhaled our food. i could barely pause between bites to answer him. it was so good. exactly the same as the taco shops in san diego, which ive missed terribly since we moved away. my husband got the smaller portion of carne asada fries and still had leftovers to take to work with him today. they make high quality food and dont skimp on the good stuff at all. we will definitely be back!
i have to say finding this place was serendipitous. i had just ran out of gas and was able to roll up to a gas pump. i went inside to pay and smelled delicious, well seasoned meat sizzling away on a grill. im like...hold up. theres a taco joint in here? i wasnt too hungry, but i could eat. i ordered 3 carne asada tacoswhich were seasoned to perfection. so of course i was obliged to return. i came back the next day to get a burrito. returned the next for a chimichanga. i think the bottom line here is i may require rehab. im addicted.
i was looking for a taquiera near my house and this was the first place on the list. all the reviews it had were 5 stars, so i had to try it. i got 3 al pastor and 3 carne asada mini tacos. i will say this place is legit! all the reviews are true! i will be definitely a regular. this place is really good!
if the food doesnt dazzle you beyond words, mannys exceptional customer service, though i wouldnt call it that cause hes such a cool guy to talk to. five stars!
im from la and our friends who live here kept talking about this place and brought me and my boyfriend here. it was one of the best california burritos ive ever had in my life. and the biggest!!! we were sad we didnt get to meet manny. maybe next time. cuz well be back.
wow found this place on yelp so we took a drive found not find a restaurant but there was a filling station, well saw a sign on the place for mexican and said lets give it a try food was awesome service was good they will see us again for gas station mexican
really really realllllll realllllll good food. and excellent service. they will accommodate any order. we wanted a bean rice and cheese chimichanga and boy did they do it! great meal. great service. ill be back, sooner than later.
its easy to see why this place has five stars, besides the food being really delicious, the customer service was great. manny was really nice and friendly. he is really going places!! thanks for the great food, and experience.
definitely one of the best places to get a burrito in vegas this place comes from san diego burritos run from 10 to 12 inside a gas station yes inside a gas station but worth 10 12 for a burrito  100 worth it very friendly check them out
what a hidden gem! we tried their california burrito and al pastor torta tonight and both were awesome and huge. plus the employee i talked to was very nice and helpful. great customer service goes a long way and we definitely took note. we will be coming back to try more!!
really good food. it is located inside of sinclair and the food is very good.  fresh ingredients made to order right in front of you.  the quality of the product is fantastic.  if there was one knock, i would say the prices are mildly higher than a robertos, but that is likely because the ingredients are a bit superior.  each of our burritos was 9 which is not a fortune, but if you are used to paying 7, it is a bit steeper.  however, you get what you pay for... :
i seen this on yelp when checking out what good mexican places there was to eat, it is located inside of sinclair gas station which was easy to find, i got the jefes burrito, it was good, the sauce inside was like a gyro cream, i also got 3 al pastor mini tacos which were amazing and 3 carne asada tacos which were amazing as well,  i checked in and got a free horchata which wasnt to bad, wished it was a bit more creamy to my liking but was very refreshing, my son drunk it up before we could get home, so he deft was a big fan of it. overall this place is a gem and we will deft come back
i am giving this place five stars because the food was great and ben was awesome. i wish it wasnt in a gas station, because my kids were all over the place wanting candy bars, ice cream, etc.  hopefully, jefes will do well and can move to a place with more seating. however, i will definitely be back and get another breakfast burrito and fajitas for the wife!
awesome food and great customer service... you have to try this place... good mexican food!
this was one of the best experiences with a restaurant i have had in a while.having previously managed for an unnamed burrito place for a couple years i am critical of both service and quality. manny and ben exceed in both. listening to ben and manny talk to guests and taking time to explain was great and professionalism on that level is something you just dont see anymore. he did everything to resolve my payment issue and explained what he was doing each step of the way. it was also great to meet and chat with manny about the business, their vision, and living in las vegas i am a transplant from wa.my wife ordered about half the menu and it was all great. we will return.
this was my first time here. i must say...best cali style tacos!!!! great customer service  great food!!! can i give an extra 5 stars? awesome!!! i would definitely return for more mexican food!
what a truly lovely experience! ben is an all around awesome person, i felt very welcomed and a very personable experience. the customer service care was beyond exceptional, there was definitely a nice vibe and good conversation. and the food omg.. i love tacos and these are definitely now on my top 3 list. i cant wait to go back and try a burrito! ask ben to show you the tortillas, promise youll want one too!
i really dont want to rate this spot because i want to keep it all to myself, but then again the only reason i found it tucked in a convenience store is because others took the time. i knew when i walked in it was a special place. ben greeted me  immediately apologized for the wait. then a personal introduction  a hand shake at a taco shop at a gas station? thats service. they had several large orders in front of me but i didnt mind the wait as i got to see great fun  fellowship with every customer that came in. my anticipation was building as i smelled the al pastor tacos all the way home. and they did not disappoint nor did the burrito. this place is a gem  ill be back. maybe tomorrow!!!!
excellent customer service, excellent prices, above and beyond quality and quantity of food. dont forget to ask about jefes jackpot slot game to win free food!
only 5 star mexican food in las vegas for a reason! amazing staff, great customer service; very attentive and courteous. ben was taking care of me today. you can really tell he genuinely cares about the satisfaction of his guests. as for their food, that should a another separate 5 stars entirely. its amazing and freshly prepared. great job guys.
my goodness! this was the best mexican food i have ever had in las vegas. the carne asada fries were so good, i went twice in one day! my kids loved them and bens service was amazing! he is very nice and knows customer service!
been going to this place for a while now best mexican food in this side of town, never go wrong with their burritos or anything else on their menu i always get something different if u are ever around the area make sure u stop in and grab a bite to eat
great spot inside a gas station. they care about your customer experience and strive to get your 5 star yelp review. honestly its a mentality that more restaurants should adopt. generous and kind guys work the place who want you to have a good dining experience. i had the california burrito. it was tasty and fresh, beats robertos by a mile. they use real avocado in their guacamole and their salsa roja and salsa verde arent watered down versions of what they should be. theyre flavorful. the fries in the california burrito were crisp, not soggy. the burritos are huge. theyre a bit more expensive than robertos but its worth it knowing that your food was cooked for you fresh and theyre not cutting corners every place they can. tell them its your first time and they will hook you up and your panties will drop.
this was my first time here. i must say...best cali style tacos!!!! great customer service  great food!!! can i give an extra 5 stars? awesome!!! i would definitely return for more mexican food! update 12815: love love love the tacos!!! i found a new love.... queso chicken taco!!! muy bueno!!!!!
we had the rolled chicken tacos, breakfast burrito, and the steak fries. it was amazing!!!!! food was brought fast and fresh. i will be returning for more! thx jefe!
what can i say. jefes taco shop is the best vegas has to offer. love how it brings a little san diego to the valley. great service, great food. do yourself a favor and get over there.
ok. i wanted to make sure i tried several of the menu items before giving a review. this place has 5 stars so there is some pressure to make sure that the review is accurate. i dont want to do something knee jerk and ruin their rating. ive been here 4 times now. each time i have gone with different family members or friends. ive got to say that everything ive had here has been excellent. everybody else ive taken has really enjoyed the food as well. weve tried probably 80 of the menu and everything is extremely good. customer service is excellent. they have special systems set up to remember your past orders. thats really nice. the ownermanager ben also remembers your name. also a very nice touch. the only downsides are 1 it is in a gas station tucked away behind ann road 2 seating is very limited, and 3 since they are getting more popular and busy sometimes you have to wait a while to get the food.but now that i think about it the down sides are just more excuse for it being unique and eclectic. kind of like tommys burgers in la. in short they deserve the 5 stars that they have so far. take the trip, try to find them and enjoy a great mexican meal.
this place is excellent!! great customer service, great food... i will definitely go back there. can i give 30 stars instead of 5?! because this place definitely deserve.
this place is the best taco shop in town with even better customer service. their sauces are not watered down and they use real guac.
we just moved to vegas and happened to stumble upon this place and are thrilled beyond words. were home sick moved from la this place has the same taste and style of street tacos back home. really nice service, quick to prep the food and the portions and price and just right. will be coming here again soon!
first time here. food was great and ill definitely be back to try some variety. i do like how they are working on a healthier menu as well but will accommodate if you ask for a bowl or less oil, that type of thing. my biggest take away was the superb service. ive never experienced anything like it, especially from a taco shop in a gas station. the owner ben knew every person that walked in there by name. you can tell hes a great sales person but not shady and genuinely cares about his customers. he has some interesting ideas and i know hell do great things. went in for 3 tacos and had a 2 hour conversation with the owner. its almost like a networking spot. im usually not a very social person when meeting new people but this was a great experience and im referring everyone i know. thanks again to ben and his crew!
the food is amazing customer services beyond the best. theyre very personable and just overall great experience. i love local good food,and i can gamble while i wait!!
im ruined,  i am absolutely ruined because now and forever i will judge all other mexican food places by jefes. the five star ratings are true and just,  the food was amazing and fresh and just so damn tasty! i ordered a jefes burrito which comes with carne asada,  pollo, and shrimp. my god the shrimp! delicious,  plump,  perfectly cooked morsels of seafood goodness next to perfectly seasoned and seared meat and chicken. the meat was juicy and flavorful,  not dry,  and each bite contained the perfect ratio of meat, guacamole,  and sour cream.i tried both their green salsa and red salsa and wow! the green salsa had that nice little kick on you tongue,  while the red was a smoky sucker punch that hit you hard after the fact. be careful because the red sneaks up on you get those napkins ready! being from california,  i know my mexican food and jefes is the real deal. i cant praise this place enough,  with the outstanding food and quick courteous service,  this is a winner in my book.
these tacos are radical. aside from delicious ingredients, they also do a very good job with using good portions with sour cream and guacamole, which is something that alot of taco places are a little hit and miss with. i recommend this taco shop to anyone looking for high quality tacos as well as the other items on their menus.
i was at container park the other night and was greeted by the owner! she was so nice and welcoming i was confident enough to come back and trust them with my favorite asset. i loved it!
first time here as they just opened and i came since ive been getting my haircut by tina for a while now. love that she is downtown now at this new place!!  she always does a great job and its of course always good to chit chat! best part they are open late during the week. great when you get out of work downtown  or during the day at lunch and need a hair cut or clean up!  of course of you want the full treatment im sure they can do that as well. great addition to our downtown business and much needed!   drop by see tina tell her i sent you.
this place is amazing! popped in to get. my nails done for my birthday and got treated like a princess! all the girls there are super nice! i strongly suggest going here for any of your beauty needs!
i went down here because ive been hearing the buzz about the place and decided to get a haircut. normally i cut my hair myself because im just that talented but i decided to lend my awesome cranium to the hands over another talented stylist.  i love the whole box car train atmosphere and i met the owner of the business as well. shes pretty cool and definitely knows her stuff.  the place was clean and the atmosphere was energetic as well.  definitely a plus for the downtown area.  check it out if your in the area or just looking for a new experience.  you wont be disappointed.
cute salon. great prices! walkins accepted. nice stylists!!! waiting for my friend to get a trim and deep conditioning from tina who did an amazing job with my friends hair and decided to get a quick mani and pedi. michelle who is mainly a hairstylist did a wonderful job on my nails. she has the gentlest touch!
i had an incredible experience with megan at downtown beauty company. im pretty particular about who i let pick up scissors near my hair, but she made me feel at ease and did a fantastic cut and style for me!  the salon was clean, had a great upbeat energy and the staff was all extremely friendly.  i will definitely be back!
my sister needed a haircut badly for an event and on short notice chelsea booked her immediately and even offered to come in on her day off. she cut her hair exactly how it was askedwe all know people that cut too much off and this was definitely not the case. chelsea gave life back into her hair and styled a cute bob. will definitely be back and recommend her to everyone!
such a great experience great cut and hair wash with a amazing head massage! very cool place megan so sweet and friendly
loved it here, highly recommend it. we nearly walked past it, but emily walked out and complimented our imaginary band practice its behind the stage, we were goofing off. very reasonable prices and i had a great time getting to know the staff during my time, got a lot of great advice on future hair care. the salon is in a container and train car, clean, stylish, etc. definitely coming back when im in vegas next.by the way, if emily reads this, could i get the names of the products used on my hair?
got my hair cut today by chelsea. they took me as a walkin on a saturday! yay! and i love the cut. i was so unhappy with something another hair dresser had done to my hair, and the cut she gave makes me feel so good again. hallelu! prices are very nicely set and i will definitely be back.
this was my first time in downtown beauty and it was amazing! tina did such a great job cutting and styling my hair. one of the best hair cuts ive ever gotten. ive been looking all over las vegas for a hair dresser that i can trust and that is affordable i have definitely found one! tina is highly recommended and i will definitely be back. they have a lot of great services and their products are top notch. cant wait to get a facial and my nails done! thank you tina!!
i was in need of a hair cut and used good ol yelp to explore my options, and i found dbc. i called and they were able to get me in right away. i was thrilled!they are located in container park, all the way in the back, in the train, yes i said, in the train! how cool is that?! all aboard! they have a cute little salon, and chelsea did amazing work! my layers have never looked so alive! she was a sweetheart and made rest conversation. the girls in there are a hoot! if youre looking for a new place and a fun stylist, i would highly recommend it! i will be going back in for color and for future cuts!
this place is nice.  its in a train in the back of the park.  tina, who cut my hair today, knows her stuff.  the staff is super chill and nice.  i love the humor tina and her colleague have, didnt catch the other girls name.  but over they both made my first visit a memorable experience.  i will def be back!!
called for a last minute appointment and they gladly welcomed me! chelsea cut my hair and did a fantastic job, she cut it exactly like how i wanted it. all of the other stylists were very friendly and made me feel comfortable. i will definitely come back here again :
i have dark, thick, straight hair. you know how stylists blow dry your hair after they finish giving you a cut, and you think you look fabulous until you wash your hair and see it irl? yeah, no. that has happened a few times here in vegas.sheila cut inches off my hair, gave me tips on how to keep it looking fresh, and was altogether great to talk to. i waited a week to write the review to see how my hair would look and i can confidently say that ill be coming to downtown beauty for all my hairnail needs.convenient, great atmosphere, stylists who are passionate about what theyre doing and are good at it. jessica did my nails simple manipedi, sheila did my hair wash, cut, blow dry. not expensive.
chelsea has been my hair stylist for a long while, so of course i go where she goes! she listens to exactly what i want or an idea of what i want, and she explains what would be healthiest for my hair while looking great. for my sake  being a lazy, messy grungy hair person  she goes about the maintenance process for keeping those cool colors lasting longer, while making sure my hair stays in good shape. basically, i wont go to anyone else! shes the absolute best :
i always use yelp because i move around so much. i have never written a review before because most places i go they already have so many so it doesnt seem to matter. so here goes! first off this place is so rad!! all the girls working were awesome i saw so many great cuts and colors leave while i was getting my hair done! i had my appointment with megan and i couldnt have been happier. when i get my hair done usually its good but never really blown away. i usually have to restyle it when i get home or find a weird spot. at downtown beauty company that was not the case! it has need a couple weeks and have never been happier i have been blown away!! my go to for as long as i live here. megan you are the most awesome stylist ever!!!!!!
i wanted to try this place out because its in an old train! not that great of a reason to go but different than your typical hair salon so i had to go. my hair is really thick and coarse, i had no idea if i wanted to keep my hair long or do something really dramatic but megan gave me few suggestions and options on what i can do and thats when i fell in love with her. not a lot of places give you multiple suggestions and she was very patient since i really didnt know what i wanted to do with my hair. she was very friendly and asked me before making her next step. i had mediumlong hair and i told megan i really want a pompadour and she suggested to transition slowly ive never had short hair. so we went for a shortmedium hairstyle with long layers in the front with shorter layers in the back and i love it! definitely would suggest her if you dont know what to do with your hair and shell give honest opinions on what looks best for you and make you feel fabulous!!!! cant wait til my next haircut!
i was in vegas for a week opening ragtime on tour. i was in desperate need of a haircut and happened to be visiting the container park, where i stumbled upon this gem. who can resist a hair salon in an adorable old train car? tina did an excellent job with my cut which included a wash and style. the price was reasonable and the service was fantastic! i would definitely recommend it to anyone in the downtown vegas area. my only complaint is that i cant bring them back to new york with me!
i was bored one day, and i thought it would be a great idea to go on youtube to try to learn to cut my own hair. wrong move! much love to megan and downtown beauty co for saving my tresses! in love with it now!
i was in dire need of a hair makeover. so i decided to give downtown beauty a chance. my hairstylist leslee did an amazing job! i put all my trust in her hands and let me tell you when i returned back to work i got nothing but compliments and coworkers asking me where i got my hair done. she layered my hair and put in highlights. i couldnt be any happier! everybody was very friendly. i highly recommend this salon! this is the place to be for your beauty needs!
wandering the streets of montreal it is very easy to walk past this unassuming brasserie.... and, it would be a mistake.a garage door opens to spill out onto the sidewalk in better weather. and art for sale dots the walls.we ordered the merguez baguette served with salad and fries. the sandwich was smallish but very tasty. the merguez was well spiced but not spicy. huge salad and large portion of fries.the asparagus and goat cheese benedict was perfectly prepared. the goat cheese added a gamey dimension to the creamy slightly lemony hollandaise. my wife commented that the fruit salad that was served with it was the best she ever had.. 11 different fruits were represented and the melon to quality fruit ratio was generous! i would recommend passing by the more famous brasseries in this block and give a try to this underdog!
absolutely blown away by how amazing these guys are. i honestly couldnt recommend them more. i went today for my first laser session ever and i was freaking out coz ive heard some horror stories about other laser clinics. but all feedback about silk skin laser spa was awesome so i decided to go for it and to say i was impressed and happy with the service is a complete understatement!!! working at a pool in vegas makes it tough to get laser because everyone is scared of burning you but elenir was so confident and not concerned at all about my brazillian and underarms. and she held my hand the whole way through and it didnt even hurt! and the laser treatment will even get rid of my ingrowns from years of waxing and shaving! cant wait to get my facial done too. they can get rid of blotchiness, uneven skin tone, wrinkles and signs of ageing. yay! so happy i found these guys! prices are great too!
i come see elinor she does the velashape and its amazing. my waist size has shrunken and my stomach doesnt have anymore cellulite. im very happy with results. been seeing elinor for 2yrs now off and on whenever i visit vegas love it thank u!
i love silk skin laser spa! every time i walk in i am greeted and made to feel like i am at home. i go in about every month for laser treatments on my face, legs, brazilian area, and under arms. elenir is very knowledgeable and always recommends what to do for the next session. since i have an abundance of hair, i was very skeptical if laser treatments would work for me, but i am so glad that i came here because shes been doing such a great job. my hair is coming back less and less and she makes sure that i am comfortable during my treatments. i honestly wouldnt go anywhere else. this staff is great and very amazing!
love this place! such a dramatic difference within just 2 sessions!!! finally decided to get the groupon package which saves me so much money!
5 stars for silk skin!!  elenir is so professional and talented at putting my anxieties at ease.  its a bit awkward for a man to have skin treatment to begin with, and i still get nervous about getting facials in general, but elenir has seen it all. shes so experienced, gentle and calm that frankly, time flies when im on her table.  if you live in las vegas you have to take extra precautions for your skin  man or woman.  the dry air, the sun, the brutal summers and winters cause a lot of premature aging and issues associated with sweating and dry cracked skin.  i dont think enough guys realize how much better they can feel about their appearance with such a small investment.  elenir got rid of my vegas orange peel skin and removed deeply embedded toxins that no amount of soap and water would remove i tried every product on the market.  thank you so much and i cant wait for my next appointment!
i have been going to elenir for facials and massages for years, and i have to say, she is the best of the best. i feel like a new person every time i walk out of her spa. not only that, im also very proud of her accomplishments. to put it simple, call her and set up an appointment immediately.
ive been coming to elenir for years i suffer from cystic acne. her laser treatments have single handily stopped my acne! shes a miracle worker! i also go to her for my laser hair removal. i have basically lasered off my entire body. i love the results and its a fairly painless process. if your on the fence just do it! never shaving again is the most amazing feeling, and it doesnt even hurt!
i literally stumbled upon silk skin in 2014, and it turned out to be one of the best moves that ive ever made. being new in town from socal was difficult to me at first, since ive been using the same service back there for a couple of years. i normally rely on yelp, as many of you, to find the best of the best, especially being new here  not having any recommendations from friends. so i found a groupon for six sessions of painless hair removal for myself  my boyfriend, then came here on yelp to check the business plus reviews. i was blown away by all the positive and decided to purchase the packages and make the appointment.elenir is not only my beauty angel but a good friend, the only one i have in las vegas : she is one of the sweetest people youll ever meet. knowledgeable, qualified, dedicated, responsible, nurturing  beautiful. im extremely happy with all the results so far. i went from doing hair removal only to facials as well, and to be honest, i would do all the services offered if i could afford them lol. ive been suffering from acne my entire life, tried all the treatments out there with different estheticians, but laser was the most efficient and inexpensive. elenir my dear, thank you for all you do for us. we truly l o v e  y o u!
elenir has been great at assessing my needs and designing the right treatment. after a single treatment, call it a trial treatment, i have decided to purchase a package of 5 treatments. she is professional, knowledgable and passionate about her work and her customers satisfaction with care she and her team provides.
this is my one stop shop spa! ive been coming here to get laser hair removal and finishing up my armpits currently. elenir is the best and does the best laser facials without any pain. i just tried the new hydrafacial and it is life changing. highly recommend this friendly, professional, and extremely clean spa.
this is the best place ever!!! i was nervous to start my treatments for laser hair removal, but once i met elenir everything changed. she is hands down the greatest at what she does. the facials and hair removal results are so great that i dont even remember a time that i was scared of the pain. i live in la and travel to vegas just to go to silk skin laser spa. i would 100 recommend this spa to anyone! definitely worth your money!
best place ever! i fly all the way from los angeles monthly to get laser done. elenir is so kind and gentle. she takes the time and care like a mom would : i love going here and would recommend this silk skin to anyone. so worth my time and money. make sure to get the laser facial it is life changing!!!!
went here last week for my first ever laser hair removal treatment for my under arms. having heard from many friends that laser hair removal is painful, i came in very nervous. elinor was my specialist and she was amazing! she assured me that it wouldnt hurt at all and she was 100 right. i honestly couldnt even feel when she started. the salon is so comfortable and clean, with all the latest technology. i would definitely recommend this place!
i have been going to elenir for over a year and my skin has never been so good. the laser facial is the most proactive, result producing facial i have ever had. the hydrafacial is an absolute must if youve never had one. eleanir and vanessa are the perfect team, very knowledgeable, efficient and feel like family  really warm and inviting people. this really is the best of the best!
lovely place to get an express lunch. the business lunch was only £6.95 and it includes a starter, main entree with choice of rice or nan and coffeeteaice cream. i had the mix starter which included a small portion of all starters combined. it included a spicy sausage, fried veggie fritter, chicken kebab and green salad. i chose the chicken korma for my main. creamy and mild to taste. exactly what i expected. finished off nicely with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. great deal for an express lunch and truly satisfying indian cuisine.
excellent food, just the perfect blend of spices. not overly done.will definitely visit again.
joshua is a genius!! i am very very picky when it comes to my hair. after all, your hair is your best accessorie....you wear it everyday!! i have never had my hair look, or feel better since meeting joshua. people compliment me daily on my awesome cut and color. i love the movement and body my hair has! not only is he awesome at what he does, but he is incredibly funny, and has a way of putting you at ease while he is taking great care of you. he is instantly your bff, that just understands and gets you! his salon is warm and inviting, and you feel right at home the minute you walk in!!
love getting my hair done by joshua... he truly knows what he is doing and i always leave feeling so fashion forward and get constant compliments on his work!  if youre looking to make a pal while keeping up on your look he is just the guy to see.
thank you, joshua! i moved to scottsdale 3 years ago and have seen at least as many toprated stylists around scottsdale who  sadly  were just that: stylists. i left their fancy salon looking great but as soon as i washed my hair, it became apparent that the styling was covering up a poor cut.  not so with joshua! joshua listened attentively during our consultation and executed exactly what i was envisioning; over a week and two washes later, my cut looks great and fits into my lifestyle perfectly im a low maintenance hair type of gal and he kept this in mind with my cut, then when it came time to style he explained what he was doing and why he was doing it  excellent tips im currently using to mostly maintain the look with ease.  im so thrilled to have finally found a fantastic stylist who also  and more importantly  knows how to cut hair what a concept, right?! oh, and he uses kevin murphy products which for all natural freaks like me, is an added bonus.
i went to the family and friends opening. when i first walked in the ambiance its very open and refreshing. the dark meat tenders is delicious! i recommend it ! the seasoning on the chicken is good too. i honestly didnt need the sauces. but if i was to pick one, the habanero hot sauce is it !
excellent location in the downtown summerlin area. the fried chicken was amazing! with the different sauce pairings to use. theres something for everyone. we also got the cheesy burger and the blue ribbon burger and they both great. definitely a change from the blue ribbom sushi bar and grill in the cosmopolitan hotel with open windows that let in a lot of light and a more bright, refreshing atmosphere. absolutely going to come back here with friends!
amazing delicious chicken!!! definitely worth the dinner choice. and they have a fabulous staff. gonna be my new place to eat at in downtown summerlin! love love love.
amazing, food was awesome, very fresh sodas, mashed potatoes, all was great!!! the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. will be back for sure!!!
im so happy that this fried chicken place is close by to my house. crispy outside and juicy inside. we love good fried chicken and i think its the best fried chicken we ever had here in vegas. my husband enjoyed his chicken sandwich and he said he enjoyed the food here more than yardbird restaurant at the strip. definitely coming back for comfort food cravings!
the perfect combination of great food and great service!! add a fresh, clean, openairy atmosphere, and you have blue ribbon fried chicken.they just opened a few days ago but you wouldnt know it by the ease of operations. our meal was on point. i had the blue ribbon special and my hubby and i shared the loaded fries bacon, cheese, sour cream  need i say more?. chicken was cooked perfectly, moist, flavorful. when ordering, we talked about getting a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, but changed our mind. imagine our surprise when our order came with a small side of mashed potatoes and gravy! so nice of them to do and completely unexpected and appreciated.its a casual place so there arent servers but a few staff members stopped by our table to check on us, see if we needed anything. one person, alex, kindly offered to refill our drinks.its not often that i find a new place that i can give 5 stars to. but they completely deserve it! well definitely be going back and spreading the word for others to give them a try too!
beautiful space and delicious fried chicken. i loved the minimalist design, white walls and huge windows letting in tons of light. the fried chicken is breaded with matzo meal i believe, which gives it its unique texture. the meat is juicy. i highly recommend the thighs out of the three types of fried chicken. the sauces are all made in house which is crazy! we tried a variety of other dishes besides the fried chicken...including collard greens and milkshakes. i highly recommend the strawberry milkshake. fries were okay, next time ill get them plain instead of loaded. alcohol offerings are a bit limited, but since its a fast casual restaurant i will forgive them.the bluebird sandwich is this locations exclusive sandwich. my friend liked it, but im not a fan of blue cheese so i stayed away.if you love fried chicken and from scratch ingredients, come here!
fun concept gourmet fried chicken from wings to sandwiches tired the blue bird love me some blue cheese! the chicken was nicely seasoned and the habanero hot sauce is awesome! highly recommend nice venue as well, sit street side near large windows
to the owners of blue ribbon fried chicken, i would like to offer my heartfelt apologies just in case the spirit of my dearly departed grandmother appears and hits you with her cast iron skillet.  yes...your chicken is that good.as a transplant from the great american southeast, i am somewhat of a chicken snob, and have been continually amazed at the lack of quality fried fowl west of the mississippi.  one of my fondest childhood memories is of grandmas cast iron skillet fried chicken.  every thursday night was chicken night, and man could she fricassee a bird.   it wasnt a meal as much as it was an event.after joining the navy in the 80s yeah im and old dude and moving to san diego, i realized that the only easily attainable fried chicken was from the colonel.  it may have been good stuff a long time ago when he was fryin it up himself at his roadside diner, but in the decades that have followed pepsi co. has done an excellent job of turning it into an oversalted, polymerlaced, fast food facsimile of a bonein chicken mcnugget.  put another way...yuck.having recently moved to summerlin las vegas, my wife and i have spent our weekends exploring the valleys ample food scene.  to my chagrin however, all the highly touted chicken joints in town have fallen flat.  it seemed as if we were doomed to seek what pleasure we could from a greasy bucket of corporate squab emblazoned with the colonels evil grinning face.  i can almost see him in his secret control room under mount charleston, laughing maniacally as he watches us on the minicam inserted in one of our thighs by regional marketing.  yeah, i know he is dead...or is he?then, just today, as i was strolling through downtown summerlin wondering what i would have for lunch, i stumbled upon blue ribbon fried chicken.  how good could this possibly be, i thought to myself as i stopped to look at the menu.   after all, i am sure it is just a kfc in disguise.  skepticism aside, i was intrigued so i threw caution to the wind, went in, and ordered their two thigh dinner.  i waited about 10 minutes for my meal, and when it arrived it was fresh and beautifully prepared.  if you are a connoisseur of chicken, you know when you see a special piece of bird, and this was one of those moments.  i had not seen such a thigh since baywatch was cancelled. this is where grandma starts getting mad...the coating was crisp, wellseasoned, and created a wonderful shell for the moist and tender thigh meat inside.  i doused my first bite with an ample portion of wildflower honey and began slip back in time.  i looked into the open kitchen and, just for a moment, thought i saw grandmother working the fryer.  this was good stuff.  after a couple more bites of my glorious bird, i tasted my side of collard greens and was pleased to see that blue ribbon had gotten them right too.  it tasted just like it had come out of a south georgia pressure cooker.  grandma is really beside herself at this point...finally i took a deep swig of iced tea and was pleased to discover that blue ribbon knew their brew. tea is extremely important in the south.  we drink it more than budweiser at a nascar race, and it can make or break a meal.  in these days of soda fountain teaflavored chemicals, a pepsi co. invention no doubt, finding an establishment that serves real tea is always refreshing. grandma is now raising the skillet over her head...in the final analysis, i have determined that blue ribbon fried chicken may well make some of the best fried chicken i have had the pleasure of consuming.  grandma swings...  i am not sure if it is fast food or not but, in the words of the late justin wilson, it is so good you will want to stand up an slap someone...but dont...just enjoy your meal.  grandmas pan finds its target...sorry guys.
wing lover!!!! my hubby and i went to try this new place.  i ordered my royal chicken wings with fries and a chocolate shake!the wings were perfect.  crunchy and crispy in the outside.  moist and cooked well in the inside.  fries are the skinny fries and crispy.  paprika and other spices are not too hot, but just perfect.my hubby ordered 2 pieces and fries, i dont know how he thinks of it, but he finish his plate clean.  so, that means a lot to him....hehehehe!!!place is clean and tidy.  love the ambiance, cool and simple.be back soon for more wings!!!!!!
this place has a great vibe the staff is excellent, i saw the manager out sweeping floors and picking up garbage. the staff always has a smile! i strongly recommend this for some solid comfort food!
if you are a fan of cheap, sitting under the heat lamp fast food chicken...you are out of luck. quality and flavor are top notch and that comes with a price. if your deal is quantity over quality, try kfc or one of the other bargain fast food joints.the chicken tenders are very flavorful, moist and made to order. not sure what the seasoning is but the flavor is great. the sauces are unique and flavorful. thin type french fries and cole slaw that isnt buried in sauce or mayo. ill be back. wonderful food and location.
decided to give this a try i got a blue ribbon sandwich and my husband got the lunch box special 5 wings, fries and a drink for 8you will not be disappointed
this is honestly some of the best fried chicken ive had in a long time! the chicken was moist on the inside, crispy and perfectly seasoned. im usually not a fan of cole slaw but theirs were really good. i suggest mixing honey and the habanero sauce for dipping.
so ridiculously good. im not huge on fried chicken but damn this is some bomb ass food! i got the pit and the firebird and i was so pleasantly surprised by the flavors. this is no canes chicken by any means!! also got the fries with bacon, cheese and sour cream. to die for. as far as sauces go, the wasabi honey and bbq were really good. habanero hot sauce wasnt really my style, but i get it. all in all, great experience great food. will definitely be back!
ive been here back to back the last two days. and brought more of my coworkers each time.1. chicken is hot. juicy and yummy. 2. the chicken is not over breaded. 3. the dry rub is amazing.4. if you like crispy but not soggy or over burnt fries. also they arent overly greasy. you need to come here.5. the price is well worth the amount of food you get.6. last but not least. there is a server named sam. nicest and most attentive server i have ever encountered in the many times i have ever ate at downtown summerlin. and he not only cleans the tables. he also keeps an eye out on all the customers and makes sure their dining experience is top notch. i pay a lot of attention to servers and its a big part of whether or not i go back to a place. everything from helping you refill your drinks. to grabbing more togo containers and asking at the most appropriate times before i need anything. the most impressive part was how he handled the situation as he was the only server and there were many tables filled. i went to tell my coworkers he was the poster child of what the service industry should be!went above and beyond my expectations of a server at this restaurant. service was 10 stars!i went to speak to his manager today 070115  and told him. manager was also a very kind man  you can see his eyes light up when i told him about sam.sam is outstanding  i even asked for his photo to let the world see how great service is highly appreciated.i will be sure to come here again soon!!
just tried this place for the first time today. the food was great, i definitely recommend it! one of the people that works there, sam, really made the experience great. he was always checking on us, getting us refills and making sure everything was great. thank you sam!
amazingly good chicken! im not a fried chicken fan, normally, but this is so good! its all skinless and lightly breaded. huge portions, their own signature sodas and sauces really set this place apart. great vibe inside! and the fries are to die for! must try!!
the staff was very friendly and helpful gave good suggestions on menu items and checked on our table frequently. very good food i really liked the  kerrys burger i was satisfied  also loved the fact that you can have good soda combinations lol
the staff here is extremely friendly and accommodating. the manager brought us over homemade chicken fingers with fries, because he said we missfired your order, which we didnt even know. the habanero sauce is absolutely incredible. we ordered the blue cheese and bacon ranch chicken sandwiches and i am always skeptical of chicken. the chicken sandwiches were unbelievable!!! they were juicy, the chicken was breaded but not with a heavy coating. i will definitely be back here very soon and we dont even live near downtown summerlin. the staff took our trays, filled our drinks and was working his butt off the whole time we dined. this place is a must try!!! their blue cheese is also incredible.
amazing. so delicious, i still cant believe the size of the chicken wings. the service was perfect as well, our waiter checked in frequently to ensure customer satisfaction. also, they dont use peanut oil, they use soy! i really appreciated that due to allergies.
great tasting chicken! i absolutely love the pickled cucumbers on the chicken sandwiches.
this place was great! food was really good and the service was maybe even better. food was prepared fresh. loved the fries and their bbq sauce. fountain sodas were also really good. the staff was very attentive even though you arent being waited on at the tables. portions were pretty decently sized so plenty of leftovers between our two meals. tried this place on a whim but would definitely go back! love downtown summerlin so always looking for new favorites...this made my list.
i was lurking social media after an appointment and the girlfriend and i agreed to stop here. we were near dt summerlin so decided to come here.first thing i saw was the rancher and it sold me immediately. continued to look but couldnt resist. we entered the restaurant and greeted nicely by everyone. felt good and homely. noticed the very open space, nice big windows, very retro, classy 50s theme? correct me if im wrong yo. lol.looked at the menu very easy to read but hard to break my decision to get the rancher although their classic with the special sauce had me wondering what it was.. temptations rised but i stuck to my plan. i got a pbr along with the rancher. my girlfriend decided to get the cheesy... one? sorry cant remember the name 100. i can only have an overload of cheese when im in the mood. we got the combos. also two drinks. she got the honey tea and me the root beer. paid i believe 36 for two combos. i gave her 40 and told her to keep the change. it was funny.. i guess people arent used to getting tipped i didnt mind though. was just hoping the meal to be good as pictured.we sat down and they gave us the buzzer to get notice when the food was ready. i leaned it towards my girlfriend cause those buzzers be wild! well we continued to take in the atmosphere. the drinks were even labeled in a classic feel. cute signs everywhere. we both really enjoyed the logo because its very simple, cute, and a very strong brand sign. we also saw their badass new age technology trashcans. the scary loud buzzer finally rings and i got up to get food. sat down and we both had to angle our food to be social media worthy. i think we succeeded. i asked how my gf liked fries because she isnt used to like... fast food type. she enjoyed then and pointed out there was no salt. they were  great but i couldnt wait for the sandwich. it wasnt exactly i saw in the picture or how i imagined. seemed like less sauce drizzled. my girlfriends though with that cheese... it was lit. too good looking. i bit into the sandwich and was amazing. the lacking of the sauce was. completely worth it. the chicken was just.. filled and compacted with flavor i couldnt believe. following up with the pickled cucumbers it went so well togrther. it was plain out just delicious.  my gf felt the same offered me a bite and i took it. hesitant cause she had yhe cheese i still bit into it and it was amazing as well. a gentleman walked around asking how everything was as well as delivering food to tables. i was confused because why give the buzzers if he also serves? also asked if anyone needed ranch. didnt ask us but we overheard the option which was fine. grabbed some ranch from the cashier and it goes perfect with the fries.everything was really superb a lot over my expectations. the soda was really like soda. 50s feel as i stated earlier. very cream feels. not bad just not for me. the tub of fries is a lot to take in. if you cant finish one i recommend just order one combo or something. by the end of my meal i noticed tvs at the top. sports. i didnt even realize that because i was so into the food. my gf also pointed out an employee eating the meal. she figured if an employee can enjoy the meal it makes her feel safe. lol.overall.. enjoyed everything. such great food. highly recommend and will be going back to try their famous classic with their secret sauce. i cant wait! hope my words could help anyone interested.peace!
um...this is seriously the best fried chicken sandwich ive ever had. chikfila aint got nothing on blue ribbon. crispy fried batter  delicious seasoning  juicy tender chicken  perfectalso, this restaurant is super clean, service is really friendly, and they have their own soda! :fries are crispy.  cole slaw is a light and crunchy.  pickles arent overly salty. tip: get the chipotle honey!!!!
great experience all around!! the restaurant was spotless and in order. the service was incredible for a fast food joint, very unexpected. jay was especially helpful and attentive to all guests, as he refilled drinks and cleared tables constantly!! well done, jay!we had the chicken wings, mashed potatoes with gravy and french fries. all were delicious!! highly recommend the wings they were huge and juicy and cooked just right.
best fried chicken in all of summerlin!!!!! may not be the best title, but its worth something. you have to order the thighs lightly seasoned and you will not be disappointed. im not sure why they even produce tenders since raising cane is king in that category but this is what happens when you play to the crowd. i wish they were available via drive thru, but i guess classiness is essential for them. im not overly excited about the sauce other than its a nice option to cut the greasiness. overall, a nice beer and guilty pleasure of fried chicken is good for the soul here. just dont share that with your cardiologist.
the fried chicken tenders were good, and i love the shoestring fries! i had ordered the side of corn not realizing it had a little bit of spice. i cant eat spicy food at all, so i asked if i could switch it for mash potatoes instead and they were super nice and switched it for me immediately! great service as well! gerald sp? was super attentive and refilled my water and brought us ranch. hard worker!
this place is amazing! the sandwiches are huge and for a reasonable price! the coleslaw is great! its nice and tangy from the vinegar and has a little kick at the end! the service is super quick!
blue ribbon chicken, ordered their two piece thigh meal, with a soda,  first impression 14.59 is expensive,   then i got two of the largest boneless thighs i have ever seen with copious amounts of fries.  second impression,  its a good value   one of these thighs may have more meet than 4 bone in thighs at other joints quality food starts with quality meat, they got it.  this is a thumbs up
stopped by this place to pick up some food for a client the other day after several hours of running errands and driving around in the pouring rain. the staff was super welcoming and very friendly. while i waited for the order to be prepared, the gm insisted that i sit down and have a bite to eat on the house. this place is super clean and the food is delicious, but i was so shocked by the kindness and hospitality exhibited by the staff here. i cant wait to bring my family back to this place to eat. i loved their huge selection of beverages and sauces as well, but the service was most pleasantly surprising!
chicken wing and thigh is very tasty and juicy, very crispy.  we like chipotle honey and wasabi honey sauce.  i m not a big fan for fried stuff but really enjoy the fries and fried chicken.
im a fried chickenwings lover!!! i can eat chicken all day, everyday!!! love this place.
i absolutely love this place! by far the best chicken in town. i came in from idaho looking for a place to eat and was referred to blue ribbon. excellent staff , food , and service! ask for sam! i recommend the gravy fries and boneless thighs!!
so the place is immaculate. the food is so good. but the service tips it all. i have worked in restaurants and live in the summerlin area and any restaurant would be lucky to hire the boy sam they have working the floor. he is just engaging enough and is doing such an amazing job. as i sit here waiting for my to go i wrote this. its nice to see around here
came here for a quick bite to eat while traveling through phoenix and was happily surprised! ordered a caesar salad for the table that was really good and then a large how you doin? pizza with homemade sausage on it that was delicious! everything came out fairly quickly, but very fresh. the waitstaff was very attentive and nice as well. i dont live in the area so i cant say when ill be back, but ill definitely stop by next time im in phoenix.
we stopped by dinos for dinner! food was fantastic! pizza great and chicken marsala had excellent flavor! great dessert menu too.
found out about dinos from a neighborhood post, went with my family for dinner, was not disappointed, food was delicious, had a caesar salad and a 16 inch pizza , the crust was amazinggggg, so crispy , not something i come across too often living in az.. the staff is super friendly, the only thing i will mention is that they are clearly still putting the finishing touches together on the look and presentation, and are not quite all set up, but they are only open for 3 weeks and they havent had their official grand opening, but i will definitely be back and recommend it to everyone! i mean at the end of the day its the food and service that matters to me and they are a 10 in both!!!
i remember dinos on cave creek and peoria in the 80s now big daddys. loved dinos then. love it now. such a taste of authentic upstate new york comfort food.easy to criticize anyones effort, but i truly enjoyed the soft opening. have had meatballs, pasta, cheeses, delicious salads and fabulous breads. cant wait to try the pizza and beef on weck. thats right, beef on weck.closed on sunday.
stopped for lunch today. had the best tasting italian beef sandwich and my son had the chicken parm and our friend matt had the italian sausage and peppers. all were very tasty. in fact my son said the chicken parm was like an orgasm in his mouth. not sure that is a good explanation but it was really good. and as a former barrestaurant owner they did good. i also picked up some pastries to take home. unless they are not good consider this a very successful stop on our food stops. we will be back again soon.
if you want great pizza this place is a must! besides delicious pizza the food is great too! awesome lil family owned mom n pop kinda place! definitely a must taste!!!
first and foremost, the customer service at this place is leaps and bounds better than belfiore.  i am so happy dinos opened!  so far weve only had some pasta, a lot of bread, and unhealthy amounts of pastries.   they are yummmmy!  we tried a new one tonight.  ill have to ask for the name next time, but it was spumone style and delicious.  the chocolate was a perfect touch.
wife and i were ther for dinner and the food was excellent  my suggestion try the linguine and clam sauce it was off the hook the bread is authentic east coast bread
family went to dinos for dinner and the food was excellent . husband had stuffed shells, mom had a sausage and peppers sandwich and we also ordered pizza.  the food was served promptly, and each dish was great. the shells were jam packed with cheese and flavor. their sauce is wonderful. the sausage and peppers were very good also. the sausage is not in the skin so it is served with the peppers and the texture is wonderful the way the flavors mix. we love pizza and theirs was great. just plain cheese and it was wonderful.  recommend this placed highly.
we live in the neighborhood so its easy for us to go here.. and will be much easier now that i tried the cannoli.  my god!  soooo good!  i had two today and am dreading their being closed tomorrow because i need more!
this fantastic gem is more like eating with your family from back east then a restuarant! i cant get enough of the many outstanding options from homemade lasagna, italian beef sandwich on fresh baked roll with spicy giardiniera  have i mentioned with white or the how u doin pizza, oh my! lets move to dessert, yes cannolis, lobster rolls, biscotti, neapolitan  and pinoli cookies with a nice cup of coffee tops off this wonderful neighborhood experience! great date night or family gathering! ask for vinny tell him how u doin guy sent you in! enjoy!!!
a new gem. went for lunch and we were blown away. the eggplant parm was well prepared, reminiscent of rome. the greek salad was good quality and with lots of olives. we will definitely be back for dinner. have to try the veal and the lasagna.     came back for veal parm, and it was outstanding. asked for meat sauce on the pasta, which was excellent.
after having a miserable experience at earnhardt toyota see separate review i went here on the recommendation of my mechanic at aaa mesa.my front struts were leaking profusely, according to aaa. the aaa office offered to replace them and do the alignment for 800. that was a little steep, and i went to big two toyota to see if i could squeeze it in under the warranty. alas, i could not, my car was older than 36 months specified in the warranty. but they did the replacement and alignment for 657  and gave me a lifetime warranty on the struts.the service manager at big two found a coupon that he was able to apply to the bill, giving me a 15 discount.the technicians were also able to mount back some moulding that fell off the side of the passenger car door  and they did it for free. this is something that earnhardt toyota simply refused to do unless i paid more than 100 for a fullon replacement moulding. do not go to earnhardt toyota for any kind of service, friends. the waiting lounge was very nice, with free coffee, fruit and water, and all the wifi i could use. the repairs were fast, the shuttle driver took me home with no waiting, and they rinsed off my car and the service manager walked me out to wait with me while they brought my car around.
i have to give a big shout out to big two. i stopped last minute to put oil in my car  a nearby qt i know right?of the 15 people that walked by, only a big two guy stopped to see if i needed help. i didnt but that rarely happens anymore. thank you!
i bought my car here and they treated me with respect.  i drive a long way to get my car serviced here as well.  i took my car to another dealership for servicing and ill never go back.  big two treats you right!
all of the service on our toyota is done here. our service writer is ken, and he is always on point. no complaints at all from this dealership.
ok, if i lived in the area, this is where i would get my car serviced all the time! hubby and i are visiting from california...woke up this morning, and the ravioli our rav4 wouldnt start. we had this problem a month before and were told by our local toyota service peeps it was the battery...so they replaced the battery. fast forward to now, were in arizona, and ravi doesnt start. kind of concerned since we drove here  we want to get home safely. were staying in phoenix area but the two other toyota dealerships i called couldnt squeeze us in. big two was the last one i called, and by far the friendliest from the moment they answered the phone. i spoke with ken; he said they were all booked up, but once i mentioned we were from california and making the trek back home on monday, he said he would squeeze us in. once we got there, we received nothing but excellent, friendly service. waiting was not an issue since: 1 we expected to have to wait; and 2 the waiting areacafe is beautiful! complimentary coffee, water, bagels, big screen tv, and jungle gym for the kids...really nice setup!!! the bathrooms were nice and clean : and ken gave us a choice of a complimentary manipedi or a haircut...what?????? seriously!!! we only had to wait about an hour and a half  if that. they couldnt find a problem with our car but neither could they find a problem a month ago...which wasnt too reassuring, but in terms of customer service  hands down  it was fantastic!!! ...and i love my pedi! one of the best ive had!!! :
i am very impressed with this dealer.  they took their time with me and did not try to upsell.  service is excellent and toyota care free service is wonderful.  free oil changed while the wife gets her nails done.
i have to say i was impressed with the service dept.  i hate taking my car to anyone because they are always trying to upsell things, but they seem to be on the up and up here.thank you!
hard to know who to trust when it comes to auto mechanics, but i take my vehicles here because they will stand behind their work and im always presented with my options before work is done.  frank remington has been very helpfulalways professional, courteous, and straight forward with me.  i also appreciate having a shuttle service home.
i love going here to get my cars maintained. i have a prius and a camry and i bring both here. they are awesome, the waiting area is topnotch with complimentary wifi, apples, water and lots of snacks for purchase.
every time that i bring my vehicles into your dealership i receive excellent service. chris bates is a very knowledgeable service adviser listens to me and makes sure that my vehicles are checked for any maintenance that they require. he and jason briggs are the main reasons that i keep coming back to your dealership.
for the past 2 years, i have used the big two service department in chandler for  maintenance on my camry. i have never been to such an impressive service department!  they greet me with respect, listen to my concerns, and do the work in about an hour. their spacious service lobby is bright, open, has  wifi, tvs, complimentary coffee, water,  fruit, and offers salads or sandwiches for purchase. while i wait, i can also choose a complimentary manicure, pedicure, haircut, or massage. i dont think that i will every allow my husband to bring the car in for service. thanks for the great pedicure and the shiny purple polish!
we had service done on both of our vehicles today and we were very impressed.  we have been taking our vehicles to toyota in the tempe autoplex and have been terribly frustrated.  big two was able to take our vehicles on a saturday, both for their 15k services, as well as for a recall fix, within an hour and a half of when we called.  the service was done so quickly and both cars were finished within 3 hours the first one in under an hour.  the service staff was very friendly as well.  we will definitely return here for our next routine service.
i asked shane about how long my oil change would take and he said usually its about an hour or an hour and twenty minutes, then i mentioned im just a little short on time because im getting called into work today. he actually got my car back in 45 minutes! i am so impressed! and while i waited i also had lunch inside their waiting area, the lady serving was so sweet. afterwards i went over to the massage place and got a complimentary hand massage! nice! definitely had a good experience at big two and would recommend to anyone.
i am a loyal toyota customer  driving prius 2! i have always had my vehicles services at a dealership. big two is by far the best dealership service that i have every had. they have flexible appointment options and great customer service. even my kiddo likes to go to the dealership  for the indoor playground of course. they also offer great perks while you are waiting  cafe, internet, salon services, etc. make it much easier to hang out while you are waiting for your car. i wouldnt go anywhere else.
i use this and only this location for car service on my 2012 camry and love the staff almost as much as i love my car! they are always helpful and professional and i know i can trust i will receive quality service every time. i have been coming to big two even before i was a toyota owner because of the excellent customer service they provide. the atmosphere at this location is inviting for those waiting for their vehicle including a lounge area, cafe, free wi fi, televisions, and a play area for children. i havent used the salon or massage amenities yet but think they are great ways to keep customers happy! i will continue to use and recommend this location for all vehicle needs.
the service department at big two is amazing. i had such a bad time with riverview in tempe that i took my car to big two for repairs and they did an outstanding job both in repairing my xb and restoring my faith in what good customer service can be when working with a dealer. my ac went bad in my xb after a couple of months and riverview was completely unhelpful and their repairs kept failing. so i took it to big two based on the recommendation of one of my friends. big two found an issue where the hose was rubbing against the belt and causing a leak and repaired the issue without any problems. they also found a issue with my water pump and replaced that as well under warranty.
my experience is only with their service dept.  i bought my prius at bell rd toyota but i live far away from them now so i started coming here.  amazing service, no guesswork at all.  i call up, make an appointment, then drive in when time come.  they have a great sit down area with complimentary fruit, water, and coffee.  comfortable seating, and a shuttle to places away from the dealership if you want to hit target or something.  theres even a free massage, and hair parlor in the dealership.  free wifi also for those like myself who can entertain themselves through net browsing and research.  pretty awesome if you ask me.
my experience with the service department: we travel so this is the 5th dealer we have visited for scheduled maintenance and this by far was the best experience. it started with a search through yelp for the best dealer for service. from that search i chose big two and called with questions. andrew answered the phone, answered my questions. when i told him id make an appointment online. he suggested i click his face on the webpage to make the appointment. it was an easy process. andrew greeted me at the service entrance, took the information then did something ive never heard before: offered me a free haircut, manicure or pedicure then ... if i get hungry, come and get him, hed buy me a sandwich. yikes! ill be better prepared to accept next time. the waiting area is very comfortable with refreshments available, wifi, tables, and upholstered furniture. the 25,000 mile service was only tire rotation and a checkoff list of fluid levels, brakes pads, tire tread, etc. so cant really judge the quality of their work but i felt very comfortable at this dealer for service and as i said above, the best of the five ive visited.
called in to schedule my 5000 miles service. had an appointment, and was greeted by the porter.  chris, my service advisor, came out, told me it would be about an hour and a half. 1 hour and 10 minutes later i got a call letting me know it was done.  as always, they did a great job.
back again for the second time in two weeks. usualy thats a bad thing when going fit auto service. not this time. brought my wifes 4 runner in this time. service advisor was billy garland.  another helpful team member. billy took care of our 40,000 mile check up in short order. once again...very happy with big two and their service team.
came  for my first service checkup on. my 2015 camry.  i was well greeted by the garage staff and adam, the service manager.  check in was easy and i thought they were going to try and sell me some additional service. this service check was free and i got away with no sales pitch. love it !!!ps the car performs great !
on my way to big two toyota tomorrow for my second oil change since purchasing my 2008 prius. in my first visit in march i was very impressed! my service was complete and fast! in addition, the tech made suggestions for future service! lets now talk price...very affordable and fair! my mind is made up...all future service will be done at big two toyota! love this place!
weve been servicing our tacoma and prius here for 6 years now. our service advisor dan is very professional and the work is done right the first timeask for him! whenever i need parts, they are very friendly and help you on the prices thank you for making it slightly less painful!
i have gone to big two toyota strictly for servicing of my tundra.  each and every time, they have been extremely polite and courteous. they answer my questions thoroughly and when they bring my truck back it is always washed and ready to go. yesterday, they even replaced my window washers with new ones that i had bought elsewhere.  no qualms at all; they installed them for me free of charge.  my wait time was 90 min, but it passed quickly as i sat in their lovely, clean cafe facility, which included wifi.
the service department here is great! always friendly and informative. i always make my appointment will billy but when ive come in without an appointment everyone else has been great too!
so glad to have dairy queen back in the southern highlands area! need to advertise that its here.quick service. the blizzard was chunky as it should be. didnt see orange julius as part of the store.
i went in to haggen and it was so much cleaner looking.  the aisles are really open so it was easier to maneuver.  the meat is amazing!!!!!!  i was really excited to see that there was a choice between the regular quality and some premium quality.  never had that before.  i just think that it takes time to adjust to a new store and layout.  the store also seems brighter and more open.  i think some people are giving it a bad rap.  all the help is the same so nothing has changed there.  they are all really nice.
i like this store , i dont have to go out of my way to get organic products, all of the additions they have made are great , i always had to go out of my way to go to a grocery store that carried organic or just healthy products .
love love love this place! i always come here when i need a good selection of clothing that i can afford. i have also sold them some of my vintage stuff that i can not wear anymore. cant wait to check out the new location.
found this place by special chance on a business trip to phoenix.  its in a very cool building with another vintage store attached.  antique sugar itself is well thought out with many many gems.  i was able to find everything from a vintage slip to an awesome wool and fur scarf for my mom which she wears all of the time!.  great selection and super awesome customer service.
vintage junkies unite thrusts fist into airthis place has been cool forever, but the new location is a stones throw from my house, so extra cool points.but truly antique sugar is an awesome addition to downtown, we needed this! the selection is incredible!i  wrote a review for their previous location explaining how special and unique this place truly is, but i will reiterate for the newbies. everything is so reasonably priced and they actually have a decent mens department with accessories unusual at most vintage boutiques, yey for equality!the layout is super organized and easy to shop. which is great for you weirdos that get overwhelmed and have panic attacks when you step into an overly full thrift shop.i seriously have friends and family that drive from tucson just to shop here. it dont matter if you live the valley or youre just visiting, you have to check it out! :
awesome place! definitely a must if youre  a fashion bug!!!!! really like the style 1920s to 80s style. , found lots of treasures!
as a guy, finding vintage clothing is usually pretty tough.. not so at antique sugar. their mens selection is the largest ive seen in the valley. their new location at 2nd st and mckinley in downtown phoenix is beautiful and feels polished while still retaining the charm of their old location. the building is still incomplete on the outside at the time of writing this, but dont be fooled  theyre open. the friendly service is still just as friendly. definitely go check them out!
hands down the best, and biggest, selection of vintage i have ever seen. i have been to the old location near melrose and i think this new place on and street is a great update. the space is bigger and brighter and still packed with clothes, shoes, bags, coats, and jewelry.i have never had great experiences with vintage until i came to this place. clothes were always huge and unappealing. antique sugar totally changed my mind. i found armfuls of cute clothes that actually fit my small frame. everything i tried on i liked and wanted to show off. the prices range depending on quality, decade, etc, from very affordable to serious splurge but there is definitely plenty of affordable fair priced items to pick from. seriously, check the place out. youve never seen vintage like this before well, at least i hadnt. check in on yelp of facebook and they will give you 15 off your first purchase!
if you are a vintage clothing aficionado in the valley of the sun, then antique sugar is the place for you. dresses that my mom used to call housedresses and those that were known as sundresses line the racks. they have plenty of party dresses  long  short  with bows, ruffles, sequins, and rhinestones in multiple colors and styles. i could have used this resource when i was planning my 20s costume for the gangster event. great flapper dresses for everyone!theres an incredible rack of flouncy skirts for those of you who are into the crinolines and layers. some pencil skirts too. colors galore!.p.s. there is a large section of mens vintage attire. and a rack of unique ties. jewelry, shoes, hats, and lots of vintage accessories are displayed throughout the store. it was such fun to browse. i have my eye on one little black dress that i will return to try on when i have more time . . . and, hopefully, someone else will not have zapped it up! these may not have been oneofakind when they were born, but id challenge you to find a lookalike somewhere else today.my only disappointment came when i heard that this wonderful shop with all its vintage clothing used to be a few streets west of its current location for years. they just recently moved to this location i am so sorry that i didnt find them before. when i tried to look up the reviews it had before, or at least a link to them, i couldnt find anything for the previous shop. its the same owners, same merchandise, same everything but the walls, ceiling  floors. it would be helpful to know what previous customers had to say about antique sugar. hey, yelp, what gives? are all those old reviews still available somewhere?
a great place!  we found some great deals on unique items. we will for sure come back! super sweet owner and great location. also cant beat 15 percent off for yelp check in.
just found some phenomenal pieces with my brother at antique sugar!  my brother got an amazing fringe suede jacket along with some perfectly fitting wrangler bell bottoms! i found an adorable cropped, red boy scout jacket!!! the shop is wonderful and organized very well. prices are very reasonable and everything is in really good condition. so glad we made a stop here!!! definitely make a visit if you can!!!
i stumbled across this cool place after a nice dinner at angels trumpet. to my astonishment i found the fur coat of my dreams  great woman at the desk.
fantastic variety. every time i go in, i find plenty of mens clothing i would want. normally have to settle for one or two things and always could buy more. the owners also happen to be the bees knees, so its nice to support good, local business owners. check it out. new location also definitely fits the quality of the shop.
im in love with antique sugar!!! im visiting from out of town and i love vintage thrift shopping wherever i go!came to antique sugar yesterday and my bf and i left with full bags each of amazing finds!we also got 50 off our whole purchase. every last saturday and sunday of the month the whole store is 50 off! wow. im in vintage heaven. cant wait to style all my pieces. private parking lot. im a fan!
in desperate need of a good cocktail in fountainbridge? we stumbled into this very newly opened place at the end of the canal looking for a friday afternoon drink and found a very pretty swedish with comfortable seating, a fabulous cocktail menu and friendly helpful staff. having seen the breakfast menu, we will definitely be back to try it out at a different time of day :
big, bigger, biggest. this is bar no 6 of the famous edinburgh swedish boda group. their other bars are in order of size boda, sofis, victorias, joseph pearces and hemma.previously this was cargo and the owners have done a brilliant job of making this enormous location and space look and feel cosy and welcoming. some nice touches to the outside space overlooking the north canal and the moored barges. did i say this was large? it is huge. 2 floors, 2 bars, a massive kitchen and large outdoor area. i can tell that many a visitor will have to come back to explore the space. i already have a favourite spot not telling, cos that means ill be getting competition. the service is brilliant, they have many seasoned staff from their other bars and the kitchen manager is one of my favourite cooks stephanie barnesstapleton  when you are visiting ensure you going to try one of her breads or salad dishes. you will not be disappointed!the selection of beers, ciders and spirits is a mixture of scottish local brews, scandinavian new produce and european classics imports. their iduns swedish elderflower cider is a recommended tipple. for a beer id go with the black isle organic blonde. i am glad that this kind of bar is now an established part of edinburgh, may it long continue!
what a wonderful experience! my flatmate and i were looking for a place to do a bit of university work and popped into akva, having never been there before. we were greeted on arrival, given a choice of were to sit and given menus etc. we had some tea and a sharing platter of snacks, which came within minutes. we were able to sit upstairs for several hours undisturbed. one employee came along at one point to let us know that a fairly large party of children would be arriving that afternoon and let us know that there was a comfy seating area in a slight alcove so we wouldnt be disturbed. we also ordered the soup of the day, which was delicious. i would thoroughly recommend this as a good spot to study, read or just chat with friends!
love this place!  i only write reviews when the food is great!  corned beef and cabbage was delish!  meatballs were awesome!  mac and cheese was the best!  and the baked chicken was crispy and excellent!  needless to say...well be back!!  jeff and aaron were excellent hosts!
las vegas locals spot service is on point anything you need they got it  quickly all the staff are so attentive and kind the head chef comes out to make sure you like everything and then wants to know what could be better...who cares enough to do that these dayswe will be back!!
siegels 1941 is in the el cortez hotel and is a brand new concept.  it was lively and bright.  its open 247, so we went for an early dinner.  we were greeted promptly and pleasantly. our waitress was friendly and helpful with the menu and wine list.  we loved the shrimp cocktail, it was chilled well and the shrimp were cooked perfectly.  my husband and i both had delicious steaks, but the stand out of the meal was the scalloped potatoes.  they were awesome!!  and i rarely eat carbs or cheese.  all in all, i enjoyed our entire dining experience and cannot wait to go back to try other delicious looking things on their menu.
ive been to this restaurant 2 times and both times were awesome the food is awesome and the staff is great.  not to mention the interior is slamming so retro looking cant wait to eat there again. if i could give this place more stars i would
liana is the best. i cant speak highly enough of her professionalism or the quality of her work. her prices were right in line as well! my whole extended family has used her for years, and she will definitely be used by my immediate family for years to come!
liana always does an amazing job.  shes turned my husband into a believer that newborn and maternity pictures are something to treasure and worth paying for to ensure quality.  she impressed him with her hard work and amazing studio.   i am always impressed with her attention to detail,  patience,  talent,  and ability to capture great pictures when were not photogenic to the slightest degree.   thanks to her,  we have pictures well treasure the rest of our lifetime.
if youre looking for images you are going to treasure, liana is who you go to. she is an incredibly talented photographer who is so passionate about her job. she gave is helpful instructions for the morning of the shoot to help things move more smoothly. her studio is full of options, you dont have to worry about getting props or outfits and she is almost more excited than you about it! during the shoot, she was patient and not once did we feel rushed. she had a glider for me to nurse and a diaper changing pad if necessary. the idea of working with newborns is stressful to me but it was evident that this is what she enjoys. when it came time to family photos, she gave very specific instructions so we didnt feel awkward in front of the camera. she put up a sneak peek quickly and they were some of the most beautiful images ive seen. being a new momma you can feel insecure but i felt beautiful in the photos. there was a great variety of our baby boy in different poses and set ups. and to top it off she somehow managed a beautiful photo of our fairly uncooperative two year old who was camera shy. thank you liana for capturing this special time in our life with photos we will treasure forever!
lianas ability to capture the essence of the person and the occasion is remarkable.  she is a professional and talented photographer with years of experience. she is patient and kind and focuses on presenting a memory in print that will bring joy for generations.
lianas ability to capture the essence of the person and the occasion is remarkable. she is a professional and talented photographer with years of experience. she is patient and kind and focuses on presenting a memory in print that will bring joy for generations. take a look at her website and her credentials.
liana does not do photography. she creates fine art! she has done four photo shoots for me over the last six years: my portfolio, engagement, wedding and head shots! she did an incredible job each time! ive received so many compliments on her work. she made the photo shoots fun, and she made me feel so good about myself. the quality of her work is incredible. she is a true professional and a beautiful artist! i cannot wait to get pregnant so she can do my maternity and newborn shots!
i love the donuts here. ive only had the opportunity to try a few but what i had was delicious. the actual dough seems a little thicker than a traditional donut but still remains super soft. yum. when i was in everyone seemed to be quite happy with their experience which is nice to see considering they just opened two days prior. im sure as things progress things will only get better. its simple concept that phoenix needed. its a great time for local food business and always a great time for a donut... or cinnamon roll... or bear claw...
attention: the dough dilemma has been fixed. you can now resume your regular donut consumption!but really, i read and heard some reviews about the dough being a little off, technically since they werent really open yet i wont hold it against them. located right where kingdom donuts used to be 1000ft from my house these guys know local food! i have to say there are some holes in the design pun intended?, theyre working on getting some of their proverbial shit together but all in all a for effort and taste. i do suggest you do something with the chocolate glaze cause that just wasnt happening for me today but other than that i cant complain! for your first official day open ill definitely be back, and if you guys started out this good i cant wait to see you when youre all grown up. props for the  customer service everyone was warm and welcoming in the teeny tiny little shop cant wait to try more flavors!
these donuts have the right balance of light  substance. i had the latte with vanilla flavoring barista recommend  was a great complement to the chocolate covered donut i had. be ready to be greeted without plenty of smiles  an easygoing neighborhood vibe.
my girlfriend and i stopped here to pick up some breakfast on the way to her sisters house who lives on this side of town. she recomended it to us. i really dug the atmosphere and my girl loved the donuts so much shes already coming up with more reasons to visit her sister in the morning. if you havent visited this establishment and tried the donuts, i recommend that you do. we all know that a donut is a donut, but for me to make the drive from tempe for something like a donut should speak for itself.
i originally wrote a review complaining about the sewer smell. the owner was so kind in responding immediately to my concerns. thank you!  he even offered to bring donuts to me!  that is honestly the kind of customer service we lack in this day and age. it is the same customer service i provided in my last two businesses one i owners for 13 years and the other for 14 years.  customer service can make or break a business. cant wait for the problem with the building to be fixed and to enjoy the nice design of the eating area and great donuts.
loved this little place! simpleclean ambiance with a true arizona feel. we had the prickly pear and maple bacon. so delicious. i thoroughly enjoyed both, but you have to try the maple bacon!
very delicious.  i love the salted caramel donuts.  did not care too much for the prickly pear, but the design is hella cute.
wow!!  we had born and glazed cater in some breakfast treats for my employees and they were loving it!  we got an assortment, everything from classic glazed to prickly pear.  i had the maple bacon yes there is real bacon on top drool, and i am seriously wondering if i can ever eat a normal donut again as nothing will compare to this.  nick the owner was super friendly, on time, and really took care of us.  if you want to impress someone or your employees go here and get some serious gourmet donuts they even have samoa donuts like the girl scout cookie.  we will be getting more from them dont wait!
so after being told numerous times i need to try born and glazed i finally made it in. definitely glad i did. i got there early and the doughnuts were just coming out of the kitchen, smell was heavenly. i went with the salted caramel, freakin delicious! wifey got the prickly pear and yep she loved it too. staff was super friendly and the doughnuts super fresh. i strongly suggest paying them a visit!! you will be glad you did.

the maple bacon donut is the best donut i have ever eaten!!!  make sure to get the cinnamon roll too.  the orange zest spray on top is the perfect compliment.  get there early because the donuts go quickly.  service is great and staff is very friendly, especially nick.  they make the only donuts worth eating in scottsdale.  if i could give them 6 stars, i would.
this place is a must go for the best donuts in az! the owners are so hands on, knowledgable  some of the kindest people ive met here. the flavors are so unique  super yummy. they are so worth the cheat on my diet! thank you born  glazed for bringing amazing donuts and other amazing treats to our city!
there is no shame in eating something as glutinous as a doughnut if its as hip and stylish as what these boys have created with born and glazed! doughnuts seem to be the hot new treat and these are some of the best in town. you can snack on next level fancy favors like strawberry shortcake and maple bacon while sipping on a house made dirty chai and checking out local photographer janet scotts gorgeous desert prints. definitely hit these guys up the next time you need a treat!
where can you get a key line pie donut or a samoa donuts? well you can get that and much more unique clever delicious design donuts at born and glazed. they have been open for 9 weeks now, and the girlfriend and i have been in twice. each time we were greeted by their friendly and helpful staff. definitely worth a try. i hope they stick around!!!
and to the crazy person who keeps sending me messages saying im a jerk because i am celiac yet chose to eat a gluten containing donut: buzz off you troll!
visiting arizona and my family took me here to try the prickly pear doughnut. the inside of the place is great, way nicer than any doughnut place ive ever been too. the service was perfect!!! super nice even to the messy children we had with us! the doughnut was definitely different, but delicious. the perfect in between of greasy and cake. the strawberry cheesecake doughnut was amazing!!!
no secret. i love local spots and i love giving them props. thumbs up to this little hidden gem. hands down the best donuts i have had since moving to the valley. weve tried the prickly pear cactus and key lime donuts. ill be back to try the maple and glazed ones. they are super filling and thats the only thing i disliked because i wanted to eat more! the staff is friendly and the place is decorated in the minimal which works. its easy to drive right by them and not even know theyre in this plaza so be on the look out next time youre driving on hayden!
this aint no krispy kreme!!! its next to impossible to find this artisan style of doughnut in az, and im glad that born and glazed brought some diversity to the valley! each time i go to this little hidden gem, i try a new morsel and they are just so dang decadent its hard not to go home with a dozen or more. it doesnt get much better than treating yourself to a sweet, cakey, truly original style doughnut  and sipping on some smooth espresso to start off your day. this spot has definitely blown up since they first opened so believe me when i say they sell out!!! so get there early so you can try these delectable delights before they all run out!
this place is the truth.  i just got back to work after picking these up for the first time.  i had carefully picked out a dozen for my coworkers from the variety of unique flavors, paid, and started walking out the door when the door came back at me hit my box and sent all my donuts to the floor.  as i started to pick them up, the one person working there ran after me and told me to come back in.  and before i could say anything he had almost reboxed my exact order and gave it to me free of charge.  i wish i had gotten his name, but to whomever owns born  glazed, that guy deserves some kudos.  i will be coming here regularly to pick donuts up from work sorry, bosa.  and as far as the donuts go, they are awesome and loved by my coworkers.
these were really amazing doughnuts! the flavored were more gourmet than your typical bosa doughnuts. saw this place tagged on instagram one day and dragged the kids down there! i got the cinnamon roll, son got the samoa and daughter got the salted caramel. we all loved them! the cinnamon roll had an orange taste to it, and was hard to eat while driving. however, there was no way i could wait until i got home to eat it!! we will definitely be back  worth the drive for us!
ive eaten hundreds of donuts...and this place has some of the best around. great taste, awesome flavors. 5 stars all the way!
love this place! the donuts are gourmet, the have tasty fun flavors and the coffee is also great! awesome neighborhood spot, much better than the bigger chain places.
we love living down the street, from what we deem, the best little donut shop in the greater phx area. this shop has character, charm and best of all great donuts. hoping to see more small businesslocal cafes, stores and restaurants enter into s. scottsdale like born and glazed.
i love this store great customer service better selection and quality in produce two thumbs up. :
i really love this food chain market.  i have always preferred quality in meats especially.  the meat department has extremely nice butchers. they always help me to make the best selection. people must realize that anything of quality is expensive  is good for you. i understand the sudden change but at least you have choices.
good morning past and present vons and haggen pharmacy customers. the crew at village center haggen pharmacy will be transferring to the albertsons store at 10250 w. charleston. it is located at the corner of town center and charleston. just 3 miles from the haggen location. steve, mary and the crew are looking forward to taking care of you at our new location starting friday the 9th of october. see you then.
the best cajun  creole youll find!!!  everything on the menu is delicious!!!  chef brandon brings in the special bread from louisiana. do yourself a favor, and get the housemade cajun sausage poboy its the stuff that dreams are made of!!!  he totally nailed it!  everything is superdelicious!!!
what an awesome cajun restaurant. i had the shrimp po boy and chicken sausage combo and exceeded my expectations. the spice and flavors were perfect and looking forward to my next visit to try everything else on the menu! you can instantly tell the chef cares about his louisiana trade as soon as you take your first bite. coming back soon with friends so they can enjoy as well
best fast food cajun spot in vegas! after being open only a couple days im hooked. try the chicken and sausage gumbo. yummy!chef brandon is a great chef and courteous host. all of the employees there are professional and accommodating.their decor is original and really neat!! great place for lunch!
the best po boy shrimp sandwich i had ! love the veggie gumbo too! will come back with friends!:
i myself am from louisiana and have been searching for some amazing louisiana cuisine and i have found the spot. from the decore to all the amazing food options, this is the place to eat downtown.
the atmosphere was pleasant and friendly. i enjoyed the shrimp poboy and chicken gumbo also talking with founder brandon. great experience also awesome location when already enjoying fremont experience go to zydeco poboys for lunch or dinner baby.
yummy gumbo and shrimp po boy.  ive also had their dirty fries to, and its all fabulous.
went here the other day with little expectations. i was blown away by the food! the debris and catfish sandwiches were amazing, let alone the new prices for the combos. dont leave without getting the cajun onion rings. if youre familiar with lucilles bbq, its on another level. and ask for kelvin he gave the best service ever and hes such a cutie heheh. i dont normally write reviews but i had to go out of my way to write this one. will definitely be back!!
such a cute environment. when you walk in, it feels like youre back in la. i had a shrimp po boy combo. so good and so much food! the owner was there and was so nice. loved it! a must try.
what better way to beat a hot downtown summer day than with a hot bowl of gumbo? the spice is just right, not too bland, and not overpowering. need to try the poboys next time.
for the money, this place is great!  i went for lunch on a friday and got there just in time to avoid the noontime rush  the place was packed. i got the debris poboy, a nice bread roll filled with juicy, tender beef brisket, shredded greens, and a lovely sauce. you can combo it for 1.50, giving you a soft drink and side. i chose the french fries, and they were deliciously seasoned, crispy, and bountiful. i got a very highquality and tasty meal for under twelve bucks. nicely done, zydeco people!
food was really good.  i suggest the turkey with onion rings.  delicious.  customer service was great too.
had the fried catfish poboy. definitely the best fried catfish ive had...ever. we all enjoyed the onion rings too  yum! the inside of the restaurant is clean and inviting, and the prices are reasonable 10 lunch special  drinksidesandwich. more review to come after a second visit :
i was so excited to discover this little gem downtown. i love poboys but have yet to find any good places here in las vegas until i stepped foot into zydeco on saturday this past weekend.  the restaurant is pretty small, but everything in it was designed and handmade by the owner and chef. the tables are doors that he sanded down and painted. its just super cool to see all the detail that was put into every inch of the restaurant, including the food!i ordered the shrimp poboy, and fiance ordered the zydeco special. we also got a small order of dirty cajun fries.  my poboy had an abundance of golden fried lightly breaded shrimp with just a hint of spice. the bread had a nice crispiness to the outside and tasted so fresh.  it was like heaven in my mouth with every bite. the zydeco special was almost as delicious. the combination of ham, turkey and brisket with the delicious jalapeno mayo was amazing.  the fries are skinny cut similar to mickie ds and come smothered in cajun sausage, carmelized onion and cheese. i mean, need i see more?! you would also expect that maybe they would get soggy under all of that, but they were stayed fresh, hot and crisp. the size small is also not so small. we couldnt finish it because we were so stuffed.i could eat here every day if i was closer to downtown id also probably have to work out a whole lot more. the food is on point, the atmosphere is bright and cheery, and the staff is so nice and friendly. you may even get a hello from the chef if theyre not too busy.
i hope this place makes. i was never really into gumbo but now the craving strikes weekly and it was all because of this spot.
food was really good.  i suggest the turkey with onion rings.  delicious.  customer service was great too.
cute little spot downtown! i had the debris poboy and it was freaking yummy! the bread was even on point! definitely a much needed great new lunch spot!
the best fried shrimp poboy ive had outside of new orleans! ive been super excited for zydeco to open, and im so relieved it not only met my expectations but surpassed them! the menu is small but expertly curated, and offers a selection of poboys and delicious gumbo, including a vegan option! the bread is perfect doughy, fresh, not too thick, and the shrimp was seasoned expertly and fried to a crisp but still juicy inside. i loved the spicy mayo, and was delighted to see a bottle of crystal sauce on the table. the sandwich comes with a pickle, and for a small surcharge you can add zapps chips bbq or jalapeno and a drink to your meal. the decor is really inventive and hip, but still comfortable. its not huge, but a small and relaxing place to escape for a nice lunch. i love it so much!!!
i like everything about this place,  slightly off the beaten path. they did a nice a job decorating. the staff is nice.  shrimp poboy was tasty,  plenty of shrimp and a great bun. prices are fair.  i will probably eat here a couple of times while i am vacationing.
stopped for lunch with a few friends. we had turkey, catfish, shrimp, and sausage poboys around the table. everybody was happy with their sandwiches. i had the cajun turkey and it was very tasty. great fresh turkey brined in house with what looked like some spicy rub crust. spotless place with very friendly staff and great service. zydeco music playing at a perfect volume so you could still talk. combo was a great deal. didnt get to have one but they had a few tasty arbita beers available. we will be back.
sandwiches were delish! we got catering for our hike at red rock canyon with the mill. yummy and great on the go.
what a great lunch break from a working lunch working at the mill in downtown las vegas. the sandwiches are amazing and hearty with a sauce that is very reminiscent of actually being on bourbon street. stop by and get some of their great food, its a great addition to las vegas.
my new favorite place for lunch! the po boy sandwiches are consistently delicious. the debris brisket and catfish are my favorites, but chef brandons shrimp, ham, and turkey are also excellent. the gumbo is tasty, and the potato salad is the best ive had. you can tell that this food has quality ingredients and is made with great care.
have visited and eaten my way around new orleans many times and have to say that this place captures 85 of the charm, feel and flavor of that great city. i tried the special just because it has a variety of meats in it and i thoroughly enjoyed every last bite; from the tender brisket to the tasty turkey all covered in an addicting jalapeno mayo. my whole party really liked the onion rings: there were only crumbs left in the baskets. the place is on my radar and will definitely return next time im in town despite the place being surrounded by metered only parking.
great food! the catfish poboy is very good, fresh, crispy catfish. a little spicy but well seasoned. onion rings are sweet and delicious. heading back to try the gumbo but definitely going to be a regular for lunch.
i just had the breakfast sandwich .... it was amazing the bread was light and flakey and the ham steak seasoned perfectly, smokey and spicy a friend of mine brought these for breakfast, i will definitely be bringing my friends back to this place.
this place is amazing! they actually have real poboys! that means they use french bread from new orleans. i had the shrimp poboy with cajun fries and my wife had the debris poboy with potato salad. let me tell you it was a taste of home. the food was fantastic the service was great and the chef owner came out and spoke with us what a great guy. the atmosphere was nice the music right the food was authentic.the whole experience was awesome. i look forward to my next visit and will recommend zydeco poboys to all my friends.
one is kinda limited for good cajun food here in the west.  not any more now that zydecos is open. defiantly the best debris poboys around. you cant leave without a takeout of gumbo. check them out, right across from the container park downtown.
went to try this place out before hitting up the pride parade because of the yelp reviews i read, plus the food looked scrumptious! yup... the majority of the reviews that praised this place was right! going in, the boyfriend and i were greeted by friendly staff. the decor was cute, and suited the food theme, but it wasnt obnoxious. hahaha... i felt tinier sitting at their tables, but it was still nice and clean. i asked for a recommendation on which poboy to get, and i was not disappointed with the flavors in the least. plus i think i got my moneys worth 28 with a tip for getting the meals my boyfriend and i ordered, especially as combos. lets see... i ordered the debris poboy with cajun fries and an angry orchard, and the boyfriend ordered a ham poboy with cajun onion rings and a regular soda. i have to admit that i liked the cajun onion rings better cause they were sliced super thin and werent overly battered. although the ham poboy had nice chunks of ham, the flavors in my debris poboy was amazing! hahaha... if youre a messy eater like me, beware of the sauce thats going to drip down from the sandwich!
stopped in for lunch with my mother in law. cute and comfortable and pleasant young lady behind the counter. great lunch and worth the drive if your craving a  shrimp poboy! will be back!!
the food and service were great. my husband devoured his french fries in only a few minutes before even getting to his sandwich. he had the special and i had the turkey po boy, both amazing with great cajun flavor. if theres time during our trip, we will definitely be back.
we stopped by before our flight home  catfish and the sausage poboys were both amazing.  get the cajun fries too  the spice is just right
the sandwiches are very good and unique, love the shrimp and cat fish sandwich, the onion rings are thin and full of flavor the best in town, the place is ultra clean and new!!
this was such a pleasant surprise!!!  being from houston and spending a lot of time in louisiana, as well as having family from there, my standards for yummy louisiana cuisine is pretty high.  this place was yummy!!!!  the staff was very friendly and helpful, the decor was cute and clean, and the food was full of flavor and spice. the bread on the poboy was flakey and fresh, and the red beans and rice was delicious!!!!  i will be back to try all the different items they have and look forward to feeling a little bit of home here in vegas. great job!!!
great po boys. bread is amazing, seasonings just right, shrimp are crispy yet tender.  a real gem.
thank you yelp for the awesome suggestion!  after tiring of sucky, expensive food on the strip, we hit this place on the way to downtown. holy moly, were we glad we picked this spot! so good.  flavorful, authentic, tasty, big portions, awesome service, and great prices make this place an all around winner.  so if you are ever near the top of the strip or fremont st, this place is worth checking out!
i came here friday for an extended lunch with some coworkers and loved it! i ordered the cajun turkey po boy as a combo with the onion rings. the sandwich was huge! i only could eat half and saved the other half as leftovers. it came with a spicy mayo and i also added some of the house hot sauce. delicious! the onion rings were great too. theyre the small delicious stringy kind. the service was outstanding! they constantly asked if we needed anything and offered drink refills. very small business homey type feel.i will certainly be back to try more!
debris po boy and gumbo are on point. best ive had in vegas. im in here at least once a week. worth driving for.
i grew up in the south and spent many years in louisiana. zydecos chef is the real deal, and zydecos po boys have made living in las vegas feel like living at home. i go at least once a week, sometimes more, to get a delicious debris po boy, onion rings, and sweet tea. and dont forget to ask for some of their homemade spicy ranch!more importantly, as a local im always looking for good food that isnt priced for tourist. zydecos poboys cost the same as louisiana po boys, making it an affordable and delicious option for my downtown lunches.service is always above par and the staff are super friendly. make sure you introduce yourself to the chef. great guy.
fantastic cajun food! catfish basket is the best buy.....have it once a week!
everything there is delicious!! its an adorable little place downtown. everyone who works there is helpful  friendly including the owner!
had the opportunity to try corkbuzz during a friends and family event  what a fun experience!the decor and vibe inside is sophisticated, yet warm. lots of seating options, including small tables and a private room. there is a 2000 bottle wine room that will look tremendous when fully stocked!service was gracious and knowledgable  our service person made great food suggestions, the manager chatted with us about pairings and we even had a chance to speak with laura, the owner! everyone was attentive, even though it was busy.foodwise, we had a couple of the starters  warm olives, and house made ricotta, along with the chickenfried rabbit. all three were solid, but the ricotta is addictive! the chickenfried rabbit was an unusual twist on a southern dish, and the warm gravy will be great when its cooler outside!the wine selection looks tremendous and paired with the food and attentive service i suspect corkbuzz will be a hotspot in south charlotte!
i was lucky enough to be invited to the friends and family event on friday night.  i love this place.the food was amazing! braised and grilled octopus was as tender as butter!.  the wine selection is top tier owner is a master sommelier from nyc. the bartenders john and dave were so helpful and courteous to us.  they knew exactly what they were talking about and made us feel welcome.  and thank you to the asian server didnt get his name who helped me in the dining room.  they focus on food and wine pairings, so the experience is totally unique and true to that.  no tvs, no loud music  just good ole fun and conversation.  it was refreshing.  ill be back when they open and expect they will do great in this location, with such professional people staffing the restaurant.  thank you corkbuzz!!
corkbuzz certainly lived up to my expectations!!!  the restaurant has a small super chic vibe, the ambiance was perfect for a date night. the wine pairings were spot on and we even got to meet laura the owner  who couldnt have been more wonderful i had the octopus appetizer, which was unbelievable. and the clam spaghetti, i have no words. for dessert we had the homemade chocolate chip cookie sandwich and it was as good as it sounds! it was delicious and the best meal i have had in charlotte by far! cant wait to return
we came back for a drink and a snack this afternoon.  this time, the service was fantastic.  the bartender could not have been better.  he was super friendly and he gave us really helpful suggestions.  the rose we had was great.  the gouges are to die for.  for us, food is always more important than service but its nice to see that the service has gotten better over the last month.  we will definitely be back for dinner again soon.
awesome experience. everything was spot on. nicely season dishes and well composed. great service. thank you.
took the lady here for a birthday celebration, and this was our first time ever going to a wine bar. wow. corkbuzz definitely exceeded our expectations as far as service, professionalism, knowledge, and quality of food and drink. and this was their soft opening!!when you walk in, you can definitely see that this place came straight from new york. the ambiance is very cool, very modern, chique. ill admit, when we both opened the menu, neither of us recognized many styles of the bottles, but they didnt treat it pretentiously. we told our waitress about the styles that we normally like, and she recommended a fantastic french wine called... checks phone...eh, doesnt matter, it was a cotes du rhone. and it was fantastic. what i really like is corkbuzzs policy on tasting. they pour a little bit tableside and let you taste anything before you commit to it, even glasses. what a cool policy.we ordered food as well; i got the burger and it was out of this world. a couple other people at our table ordered some oysters which were great as well. overall, it was a great experience. corkbuzzs great food and great service complement each other like cheese and... ill let your mind be responsible for the cheesiness.
this is the perfect california wine bistro located in charlotte. step inside and you are transported to a new eclectic warm and friendly atmosphere of downtown napa. the food is fresh light and full of flavor.  while the wine selection is impressive for a place this small.
what a wonderful addition to southpark!  the food is unexpectedly amazing.   the cheese plates are solid  especially the housemase ricotta.  the foie gras with biscuits is probably the best dish ive ever had in charlotte.  every dish ive had over two visits was excellent.  i havent tried any entrees but have instead dined on a variety of small plates.  the staff is friendly, they serve liquor and beer in addition to wine and they take reservations.  great spot for date night or girls night out.
wow  this place is a great addition to charlotte. super knowledgeable staff, great selection, delicious food. a perfect place for our girls night out. would also be great for a date night or a group. restaurant is extremely clean yes! and parking was easy even though it seems like it wouldnt be based on location. so dont be deterred! i also felt compelled to call them today to let them know that their ads that seem to be playing very regularly on 107.9fm pronounced master sommelier as master sawmillyeer. kind of a big deal when youre a wine bar with a sommelier at this level. :
the guy bartender we forget his name is awesome. very knowledgeable about his scotches and took his time with us.  night manager thanked us for coming in,  donuts were awesome.  must stop by for a few drinks.
i am not sure how laura maniec and her team decided on charlotte as their first nonnyc location but lets just thank her for choosing us. if you are a transplant looking for someplace with an upscale nyc vibe or a local foodie who demands a great food experience, get to corkbuzz. the food is elevated but not over complicated. ive been for lunch, drinks and a 4 course private jax wine dinner. the burger i had at lunch was thrilling. the wine selections are things you wont find in most places. the folks here all know a lot about the wines too. they can help you find the best one for you to try but do branch out. the jax wine dinner included the coowner ceo dan parrott who explained each of the wines with each course. there was a bonus glass the wines were available for purchase after the dinner. each course of the food was delicious.  the fried oysters and tilefish was a perfect first course. the wagyu beef was beautifully tender.try it for dinner, or one of their private wine events. now. and take uber or a cab please.
this review is solely based on their classes, of which i have have taken 2. to be honest, i was a bit concerned at the price after having attended a national competitors classes for a fraction of the cost. to state it blankly, the same reason im giving 5 stars is the same reason i refuse to shop in big box stores and always go for the mom n pop joints  the personal customer service among other reasons is something that cant be found in a warehouse. first class was a bit more informal for my book and wine club. the wines selected by the sommelier were perfect for some of the less educated wine drinkers in our group but they managed to speak in a way that appealed to all our various levels of wine knowledge. no one felt uncomfortable or intimidated or bored for the know it all in our group. the tasting sized pours were more than ample and some really fantastic cheeses were included. everyone stuck around for more wine and dinner. service was excellent. the food is very delicious. the second class was again more than ample pours of some really great comparisons of old world versus new world. shawn the sommelier is very educated and funny and again made the class feel comfortable in sharing his knowledge in s very approachable way. so much so i kept interrupting to ask a bunch of questions and he very graciously answered all of them and managed to still keep the class on track. again more cheesebread offered. i didnt stick around for a meal after this time cuz i was in s hurry but really enjoy food here on a regular basis. to speak of other classes ive been to elsewhere: theres  just some things a canned powerpoint that is taught the exact same way across a national brand thats driven entirely by which wine of the week theyre  pushing that doesnt make it worth it. instead i felt like my money and time was well invested here  on some really fun classes, in a comfortable setting.
incredible bar experience quiet, attentive bartenders going the extra mile with a great ambiance. will definitely stop by and the best wine bar of the south park area
wonderful staff, super friendly and helpful. also very knowledgeable about the different products. definitely will visit again.
beautiful place! great buds! tried the fire alien kush. great clearheaded, balanced strain with awesome body tingles. friendly knowledgable staff that really takes the time to make your experience amazing.
i was very impressed with my experience at las vegas relief. its definitely my new go to dispensary.pros  environment  the interior is beautiful. you can tell they put a lot of work into the design of this location. i was a little surprised actually. walking across the parking lot to the front door i took notice of the surrounding area which is almost dilapidated but my concerns were unjustified . as i entered i noticed that they have added levels of security than other dispensaries to ensure patient and employee safety. they have also spent a lot of time working on the interior. it felt like i was walking into a boutique salon on the strip.  staff  i can honestly say that the staff goes the extra mile for their patients. during my visit they consistently strove to make sure that i was comfortable with my purchase and that all my questions and concerns were addressed.  product  i was ecstatic upon seeing the product at las vegas relief. i was very curious about the cbd products they have as i havent seen them any where else around town. the flowers, however, were what caught my eye. they currently only have 3 strains but they are quality. i did a little research on the grower, green life productions, and was extremely impressed. they utilized both sustainable and organic growing practices and it shows. i tried the 9lb hammer. a potent indica that did wonders for my back pain and helped me get a good nights sleep. i was a little startled at the price, 65 an 18th until i saw that it comes in sealed glass jars with all the testing information and its tax included so im not getting back a 1.37 or something. overall, high quality product and they say its only going to get bettercons  im honestly struggling to find cons, i was rather blown away by the experience. the entrance  i mentioned the added layer of security. when you enter they have a little security area that you have to pass through to get to the registration area. the door from the outside to this room has a little door bell. i rang it and for a minute thought they were still closed or something as there was no response. the second time i rang it i just pulled on the door afterwards and in a few seconds it opened. i guess theres a buzzer sound thats supposed to notify you when to pull but with traffic so nearby its hard to hear. they said they were already working on it though.
lv releaf probably has one of the friendliest staffs at any of the dispensaries. they were informative and fun. they made the experience more than enjoyable. their product was great as well.
loves it  great location and staff  awesome sauce in my book  nevada and out of state patients get the love while there  check it out
we loved the staff and how knowledgeable they were! we bought a few cbd oil products. they were not strong enough for my back pain but they said they would have more products soon, plus the oil worked great for my moms nausea. we will definitely be back again, thanks to everyone at releaf for making our first visit a pleasant experience!
i cannot say enough good things about the wonderful people and the amazing experience that i had at releaf. i am from michigan and use cannabis for legitimate purposes. i was nervous about coming to vegas and so relieved guess the name makes sense to discover this place. everyone was friendly and knowledgeable. it is a very legitimate and lawful establishment. it is somewhat hard to spot, but totally worth finding if you are a legal patient. if you are curious as to why they have several addresses listed online, its because they span three units. i have no doubt that with their friendly staff and superior product that releaf will be very successful. nathan was a great help and very personable and the other two gentlemen whose names escape me... hmmm i wonder why and the experience over all was the high light of my trip thus far. i am extremely grateful for the experience... and will go down in history as patient number 420 at the first dispensary in las vegas no lie. they have only been operational for 23 weeks, but you would think they had been in the business for years. they have increased the number of strains available since the experience of previous patrons... i would guess they had 1520 or so in stock prerolled if you prefer.
i can not say enough wonderful things about this place! the facility itself is so nice and im always offered water and snack while i wait. everyone that works there is so friendly and the quality of meds is fantastic. this is my go to dispensary and i would recommend this to any mmj patient!
best prices ive found at a local walkin dispensary. great service. very friendly and helpful staff. i love the huge digital information and pricing board in the waiting room. they offer free water and munchies candy, breakfast bars, crackers, etc. when you enter. large comfortable product display room with great lighting. excellent selection of strains with occasional sales, too. not the closest dispensary to me, but almost always worth the extra travel. their green life products are of the highest quality. i get free big macs for my purchases. im not sure if thats a limited time special, or if thats a regular thing. overall, this place is topnotch.
pretty good variety. good prices. definitely give it a try. i prefer this and chen wok over panda express any day.
been a long time customer of chen wok, flavor started getting bland orders getting messed up. tried chef panda tonight ordered dishes we always ordered from the other place hands down way better flavor comparable portion size n price but chef panda wins out with boost in flavor this will be my go to from now on n we get it once a week cant wait to try other dishes. i also started reading others reviews and no surprise to find the only person to give it a negative review was a colts fan they have no taste anyway keep it up chef panda, and the last time i checked the dish you ordered is called general tsos chicken not general chicken you probably actually ordered it from chen wok hence the mess up. oh and just fyi an online menu is available through a link from chef panda through yelp just have to be able to read and anyone who has ownedstarted a business knows the are kinks to work out so cut them some slack.
i wasnt going to order thanks to the 1st review but i am glad i tried it after all. the orange chicken was crispy and sooooo good and the portion size was more than enough!the chicken broccoli was good as well, lots of chicken and veggies. orange chicken is my favorite so far. my husband and i will definitely be ordering again! finally good chinese food that delivers! chen wok is disgusting!
wanted chinese food today, usually order from chen wok, took a leap and ordered from chef panda and im glad we did, this food is awesome! it arrived hot, not lukewarm but hot. the egg flower soup had so many fresh vegetables in it and tofu you could actually see and taste, the steamed rice had a pleasant hint of jasmine water and their egg rolls were the bomb! the price was reasonable and the service was fast, way less than the hour we were advised. i didnt mention any of the coupons they offered but they gave me the extra specials regardless. i also have to say derrick who took my call is the best order taker ive every dealt with, he was the most pleasant, helpful and energetic person, and an asset for this new business in surprise. the delivery guy didnt get your name, sorry was stellar as well. we will be a repeat customer.
my family and i all ordered different dishes again this evening, and they were all great! our order even included a few complimentary items for sampling that we will definitely order in the future. anyone utilizing the yelp app to decide whether or not you want to try a place based on reviews dont let any commentary left by a person by the name of jeff c dissuade you this guy thinks he knows more about the restaurant business than anyone and alot of his posts are ignorantly written and spiteful,  just click on his name and click on more about him and read not only his posts but why you should read his post answer, and i quote, because i know more about the restaurant business than you do joke. dont let the the self absorbed biased reviews of one fool change your mind about your dining preference unlike him you have a brain try chef panda and decide for yourself you wont be sorry.
delicious food! if i were to compare it to san francisco chinese cuisine, i would say its a pretty good competitor. the boss is super nice and makes great conversation with the customers. hard working employees and the prices are great! for only 5.99, i got myself a pepper steak lunch special and my mom shrimp with lobster sauce for only 5.99 too!!
always great here. staff very sweet.  the food is some of the best chinese ive ever had in arizona.
decided to try this place over the weekend. my family actually really enjoyed it. we ordered orange chicken, moo shy chicken and teriyaki chicken. large portions, friendly staff and great prices. definitely better than panda and other local asian restaurants.
holy smokes!was about to go out to eat, and found a menu in my door! decided to take a shot and so glad i did!!!! amazing food and quick to my door! definatley will be ordering again
finally!  good chinese take outdelivery in surprise. sweet and sour is bomb! they give you lots of food for the price.  the owner is a really nice guy too!
ive been there many times and ive never had a bad dish they each seem to get better tasting each time. and they have great lunch specials. i would highly recommend this restaurant to anybody that likes oriental or chinese food!!!
fast, reasonable, and tasty! chef panda is great! we ordered their shrimp lo mein, bbq pork fried rice, and the orange chicken. it was delicious! we will definitely come back and the staff is great.
best chinese food in surprise!!! very tasty and worth it. delivery was fast too. i have lived here in surprise for 10 years and have tried every chinese place in town. chef panda is by far the best one of all. very happy!
been to chef panda twice now and both times the food was delicious.  sweet and sour pork was cooked perfectly.  the almond chicken was good too. orange chicken was great!
excellent service and they have khalil mamoon hookahs which is awesome recommend this place for everyone ,the employee was extremely professional and i liked the way he took care of me .definitely gonna come back !the shop is new so feel free to check it out ,also i liked variety of products they had
not a bad spot, the guy behind the counter is cool and sells their premium house juice at a decent price. be sure to try as much of their flavors as you can. i recommend their cucumber wintergreen and pomegranate menthol which i actually just picked up earlier. they also have a good amount of vape supplies and brands youll want to check out. the guy actually helped me figure out a kengartech rba which im still a newb at. give this place a try if youre in the neighbirhood whether a beginner or elite vapor.
i hadnt heard of this place, but josh the owner was super cool and knowledgable. theres also a great selection of herbs, glass,etc. ill definitely be coming back.
great spot for new vapers and experienced vapers, one of the best costumers services ive ever had, they help you out and provide what you ask for and their eliquid is on point, try their rose flavor. definitely recommend this shop.
the best car repair in town, have been using kris for my repairs for years and wont go anywhere else, best and most honest mechanic
i took my car in for an oil change and brakes. really basic stuff. the price i paid was fair and the work was done right the first time. the one thing that really makes it 5 stars to me was hearing kris talk to other customers. kris took the time to explain the repair process and even offer a ride home or to work to other customers. great consistent service is hard to find when getting your car fixed. you will find it here.
im happy i found a good mechanic in my neighborhood. kris and his crew are good at what they do and very friendly! heres a couple of examples:i took my car in because autozone told me that my battery was in great condition and i had another issue with my car. kris took a look at it, realized the battery was almost dead. very quickly, sent his people to get me a new battery mine had a guarantee still, replaced it at no charge. when talking to kris, i noticed that he is an honest man, explains the entire process and will do the right job one time and fast.now, i took my car to get the brakes done, he quoted me a very reasonable rate, explained to me what he was going to do. scheduled the appointment, worked around my schedule even offered to take me home so i didnt have to wait with the kids! kris has earned my business and i would recommend him anytime!
solid shop with the best customer service i have ever experienced. my wife and i have 3 vehicles, that all have over 150,000 miles on them, and we trust this shop 100!!!doesnt get any better: reasonable, intelligent and honest. try em out! you will see the difference. i highly recommend the kar shop!!!
chris  his staff are awesome, honest  trustworthy guys. always do great job on our vehicles!! they dont try to do repairs that arent necessary  will be totally honest when you need work done or how long you should wait!! best mechanics in the valley!!
awesome truck...cant wait for brick and mortar location to open.  the nashvegas hit chicken is the best in the west coast!!!  house pimento is amazing!
love this place! sweet tea and the best bacon mac and cheese and lobster hush puppies. do yourself a favor and check this food truck out. you will crave it like i do!
must try! the corn hushpuppies are amazing!!!  the bbq sammy w slaw, bomb shniggety!!!!!  chef john makes his own pickles and makes them right...soooo good.  we found them parked out in front of velveteen rabbit, downtown on main, on a saturday night. what a great pairing. order food, and then go in for a yummy cocktail.
ultimate mac and the blackened catfish sandwich are amazing. definitely recommend to anyone who likes southern food, and even to anyone who doesnt. youll say to yourself omg, i cant believe this came off of a food truck! oh but it did, and it was delicious!
love the new addition to the silverton! food is delicious. havent tasted anything i didnt like.
so thrilled to have authentic asian cuisine near my house now!  the room is so modern and the music playlist is awesome.  i love the variety of asian food available.  they make handmade potstickers and broth.  great for vegetarians too!
love me some wuhu noodle! been there twice in one week. it was yummy food sit in and as take out for dinner at home. so far weve tried the duck delicious!, pork, sticky buns both kinds, ragoons that have an awesome curry flavor that makes these unlike any others, orange chicken made with real frikn oranges not some nasty canned business, spring rolls....pretty much half the menu! while at first there was a small wait during lunch rush, i got my take out dinner order and was in and out in 15 minutes. totally delicious and not at all expensive. cute little spot for lunch too. ill easily be a regular. besides, its an excuse to play my wonder woman slot machine :
the food is delicious !! the staff is very friendly !! im eating here all the time. the pot stickers are hand made the curry crab puffs have so much flavor! the singapore noodles are my favorite!!
i came here with my whole family and my boyfriends family. the biggest table we can get was for 8 people, so we had to sit separately, no big deal though. you order from the counter and they bring the food to your table when its ready; it was pretty quick!this small restaurant has a nice ambience with a contemporary design. the prices are very reasonable with the big servings and deliciousness of the food!craving for noodles but just cant decide what you want? this restaurant is perfect for you! they have a huge variety of noodles, from pho to pad thai to ramen!
i definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family. the food is very authentic and delicious. i havent tried anything like it before. the service is great. just be patient, excellence takes time. food comes out quick but not too fast. so dont expect something fast like panda express. anyway just go and check it out yourself and be your own critic.
i have been to wuhu noodle four times for lunch and each time has been nothing but satisfactory! each dish is made to order, authentic and full of flavor. you can tell that the chefs  have a real passion and love for cooking. every dish from their pot stickers to singapore noodles have been to die for! they even offer carryout which is amazing!
this place was new so i wasnt sure what to expect but i really liked it! the service was really good. there was a head chef that was going around to all the tables to ask how things were which was really nice and the staff was attentive as well. this is a sit down restaurant but you order at the register and then you sit down and wait for them to bring you your food.the food came out really fast and i didnt have to wait long. i got the ramen with miso, crab ragoons and the walnut shrimp. all three dishes were awesome! the shrimp was probably my favorite because it was the most different out of all three and it tasted so good! i had ramen left over because i was too full to finish but i cant wait to have it for leftovers.the prices were also good too, mostly all 10 and under. i look forward to going back and trying a couple more things on the menu. if you are looking for a new noodle place i would try this out.
pretty good! had the duck and rice. best duck ive had in vegas so far. also had the duck bao buns delish! love to see chinese people cooking chinese food lol
a genuine asian experience, the food is prepared when ordered, comes out quick. the food compares to what you find in china town, employees are very friendly, and the chef chris is very welcoming and very knowledgeable and helpful when questioning the meals, he gives advice on which sauces to use with each meal.
i love this place now i dont have to go to china town anymore, fresh and quality authentic chinese food in a very clean place . i come here about twice a week. love it.
we went here this week kind of our last hurrah as we dont plan on staying or gambling at this casino any more read our review on the casino. we eat chinese quite often and really love it.  the food here was outstanding!  we had the pad thai and wuhu fried rice, both were perfect.  we often eat in china town in vegas and the food there for the most part is very good, but this was better and at a casino!the resturant is very open to the casino, and yes the chairs are high and a bit tight to get in and out of but overall it was fine when the food came out.  if your wanting chinese, give wuhu a chance, you. wont be sorry!
this is my second time coming to wuhu. i am really impressed with their food! soup is amazing and so are their general tsos chicken and siomai! will be back again!
this place is small but mighty! the chinese is strong here.  lets start with the food, the menu is crazy so many choices! this is a good thing but you will have to make multiple trips to try everything. i have been here lots of times and tried many of the dishes so here it goes. lets start with the apps, the bbq pork buns are a must, juicy and moist so much flavor going on! also try the honey walnut shrimp and the crab rangoon also the sliced bbq pork...... the main dishes are just as good! try the bbq combination rice you get two choices of duck, chicken or bbq pork. this is a 12 plate order this with some apps and you should be good to go! the beef and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken and mongolian beef are amazing also.   if you fancy some noodles they got you covered! try the chow mein, chow fun, yaki udon or the pad thai..... the restaurant is small but they some tables right out front. the food comes out really fast after all it is cha cha cha chi knees.... lol give this place a try!!!!!
i couldnt resist that.
brand new location. i was so excited when i saw that one was opening and i was not unimpressed. weve had a few deliveries to our house already with no mistakes. all the delivery people have been extremely nice and didnt freak out when our fur babies were barking like savage beasts. our orders were complete with no mistakes and arrived within the time frame they gave, if not earlier. pizza hut has so many options now from the different sauces, crusts and toppings. they always have some kind of deals going on, which is awesome. i can stuff myself with a pizza i like and mike can stuff himself with a pizza he likes. its a pizza hut so dont expect it to be a gourmet authentic italian pizza. like i said earlier, prompt and friendly delivery with no mistakes. cant beat that from a pizza hut.
my brother and i found this place by mistake. im glad we did though! if you love authentic salvadorian food then this is the place for you. the pupusas were tasty and the service was great. we will definitely be back!
the wife and i can out here. fairly reasonable and the food is authentic as can be. bomb.com
this is a small family owned restaurant serving delicious salvadoran food.the popusas are top notch and the agua de ensalada is refreshing.i recommend the carne asada plate with shrimp. its a huge plate of food and the best part is that its about 19! i think the reviewer who gave this place three stars is being mean spirited and just wants to throw dirt at this place.
awesome family style restaurant. come enjoy authentic filipino food! theres a dance floor for all you chacha sliders, and you know they have karaoke!!! they also have catering options as well! :
the special chicken wings are my go to! its just the right amount of sweet and spicy. i definitely recommend trying the pork sisig, its the best ive ever had! the bartender knows how to make a great drink! make sure you say hello ;
it was saturday night, we were in vegas, and we were looking for good filipino food and karaoke, though not necessarily in that order. we found cardings tambayan on yelp and couldnt be more excited.open until 4, with plenty of space for our large party of 12, i cant stop raving about how great this joint was.we had pork sisig, chicken and shrimp pancit, lechon kawali, pork sinigang, and enough drinks all around to put down an elephant. hands down, one of the best filipino dining experiences ive ever had. it felt like i was visiting someones family home, and the owner made us all feel very welcome.karaoke and the dance floor were the highlight of the evening, with a dj who could find whatever you asked him for, performing slick sound engineering on the sly. everyone in the party felt like superstars!55, and only because i cant give more than 5 stars!
highly recommend this place, i tried their special mix balls platter and pancit canton topped with fried pork as garnish, friendly staff and personally greeted by dj mar!
fun. filling. family. these three words pretty much sum up my experience here. there is karaoke going and people are super good at it, its crazy! the food is amazing too, i had the adobo fried rice and wings. the girls working here do a great job at making you feel like part of their family and have made a new friend and regular!
went here with the gf saturday late night with the gf. had a great time watching the people song karaoke.  tried the seafood balls which were great seemed to have the consistency of mini corn dogs, but maybe that was the red horse and san miguels influence. the girlfriend and i shared the mussels  wet pussy? and those were bomb. will definitely be back.
always look forward to buying new merchandise here. large selection, quality products, and legit staff. purchased probably over 400 dollars in products here, and have always been satisfied.
with so many smoke shops in the valley these days, its cool to know that there are still businesses where youre always greeted as if it was an old school mom and pop shop. they always have the newest puffing utensils and the staff is on top of their game when it comes to product knowledge. with prices like theirs and employees like keyshawn, theyll be around for another 30 years!!
ocotillo opened yesterday for coffee and lunch only.i dont usually try restaurants that just open, but had heard from a friend that it was good.my husband ordered the sausage sandwich and a beer and i had the mussels and iced tea.the food was great, and i like to think of myself as a connoisseur of mussels. these were cooked perfectly  obviously done, but tender and not a second overcooked. the broth was amazing  shallots, tomatoes, garlic, lime, cilantro, and red pepper flakes. the two crostini served with the mussels and broth were grilled jut right. my husband really enjoyed his sandwich which was served with cole slaw on it and french fries on the side. i didnt have any fries, but they were thin cut and looked to be fried to perfection.the facility is beautiful  open, light, hip, spacious, with a beautiful outdoor area we cant wait to try when it cools down. the best part? the service! the gm was extremely attentive, as was our server, sarah.we will be back many times, and very soon!
i heard this place was supposed to be amazing and, i have to say, i really think it is.  so, when trying a new place, i pick a classic dish to set my standard and then, if i like it, i expand my selections from there. today, i went in for the braised red chili pork sandwich. the portion was definitely plentiful. the pork was tender and evenly saturated with the sauce but was just below the point of being messy. i dig that. it was tangy, sweet, and just enough spice; it married so well with the pineapplecabbage and red onions. sides offered were fries or farrow salad. the server told me that i could get the fries japanese style. that means they season it with seaweed! they were so tasty. very clever...salting your fries with seaweed. i also had the desert blossom tea. i preferred that over the green tea. however, they both equally refreshing. i didnt ask for sweetener but, i could probably drink them both like koolaid if i had.my dining partner follows the same order of operations. he got the dry aged burger. the server informed us that they make it inhouse. wow! i was lucky to get a bite. i have never had a burger that had so much compacted and savory flavor. it was thick and was very much juicier than it appeared dry aged. the toppings were fresh,  i mean farm fresh, had to be. and, i think the pickles were made in house. i had fun with this food.needless to say, i am excited to go back. whoever designed the place did very well; a super cool and intimate atmosphere. i felt like i could spend time there all day. the people and the space are so welcoming. inside, outside, a refuge for artistic, cultural and light conversations. i highly anticipate the brunch and diner menus, coming soon. keep you posted.
cannot say enough...the work involved in bringing this remarkable restaurant to midtown phoenix is astounding! no hype....just amazing refined restaurant dishes that way under promises and over delivers
excellent food in a most welcoming environment!!! been there just once opened less than 1 week ago but headed for my first brunch now. a spot to become a regular.
tried the smoke salmon salad and the poached pear on the brunch menu. both were incredible!i cant wait to go back. such unique flavors and the atmosphere is perfect!
ohh myyyy gawwwww  i might be in love. when gallo blanco moved out of the claredon, my heart broke a little as flavor left downtown. ocotillo filled that empty spot and i have no doubt that i will visit their establishment with a frequency that might border on stalking. the space is amazing, the food i ordered the thai chicken was an explosion of flavor. i cant wait to do happy hour as the drink menu looked great. all in all, i pondered giving a 1 star review just so i can keep the goodness of this place all to myself. but alas, that wouldnt be fair. so, do it  go there and bask in the glory of flavor.
great new restaurant with ample outdoor space. i got pasta and tuna which was really good. food is a generous portion as well. the girl across the bar was raving about this thai coconut soup so that will be next on the list. good location near downtown  central phoenix but has plenty of parking . park off flower. if youre a wine connoisseur then this is your place. there are little icons next to the each wine to explain the flavor. it was pretty busy so thumbs up to the curly brunette food runner working his butt off and running around
this place is great!  food is great, drinks are on point and the wine list is exceptional!  the pitchers of sangria are out of this world!!!
so good! i have rarely been able to give a 5star rating, but this place earned it! really cool layout with a courtyard area. the food was amazing! our table ordered the fried zucchini, with  without peppers, pork sandwich, chicken dumplings, curry soup, roasted cauliflower  chili. everything was fantasticnot one complaint. then we ended the meal with the girl scout cookie pudding truffle. cant wait to go back and try more. the only warning i can give is its extremely loud inside at the tables. we couldnt hear each at our table. you might want to try the patio or bar area.
place was really busy for only their second sunday brunch. there were some delays but   once we got settled and served we really enjoyed it. tremendous value, amazing space and great food. will be back soon.
ocotillo was love at first site for me. my husband and i had an amazing brunch experience this past saturday. the architecture of this place is very cool, they have a huge yard with a coffee bar and bar with lots of community tables, its a great outdoor space. we opted to sit inside since its still a little warm. we ordered the sheeps milk ricotta dates, grapefruit brulee, raw farmers organic veggies and the chimichanga with a nutella boba iced coffee and iced latte with almond milk. everything tasted wonderful, those dates were to die for! the grapefruit brulee stood out with the subtle flavors of added mint. the veggies came with a delicious zataar yogurt sauce and pureed eggplant similar to a babaganoush. the chimichanga had a super flavorful fresh tasting green chile sauce with perfectly cooked eggs, broccoli, and chicken. that nutella boba iced coffee was pretty amazing and my iced latte was great too. i cant wait to come back and eat my through this menu. my only complaint was that the dj who was playing great music was a bit too loud. we had a hard time having a conversation and ordering due to the decibel, other than that this place was great!
i loved it!  first off, i love a brunch place that takes reservations. that alone is a game changer for me.  it is also helpful because i have a feeling this place will become very popular. the space has different areas and outdoor areas, and the energy and decor was great.  the menu was good, the food was seasoned well, and the service was good.  we had friends at another table that had some service problems, but being only open a week, that isnt uncommon and im sure will be worked out.  our server on the other hand was great.  this may be my new favorite place for brunch in phoenix!
we have been here twice. the service is fantastic. the food is amazing. i cant imagine anyone saying anything negative about this place. the gm walks around and introduces himself. and makes sure you are satisfied with the food and service. great place to chill. support your locals!!!
a group of us came in for cocktailslunch and couldnt have been more pleased. everything from the look of the space to the hospitality of the staff was five stars. the menu is well thought out and completely delivered, especially for the price point. geoffrey wilson, the best bartenders in the valley hands down has made his home here at ocotillo and just for the sake of enjoying his sazeracs and company, ill be back. cheers, ocotillo! it was our pleasure! cant wait for next time.
had lunch with a friend at ocotillo.  there is only good to say.  the restaurant, inside and out, is great looking and i am sure will be place for great times and memories.  my friend and i both had the hamburger with fries.  simply done but so goodi asked for fries well done and they listened.  the menu provides lots of options for everyone from vegetarian to carnivore.  service was well paced and helpful without being intrusive.  looking forward to another visit soon.
ocotillo is such a great place with awesome food and ambiance. had the steak and eggs omg. the best i have had especially for the price. great consideration and energy goes into the food. the place is still new so they are still working out the service aspect, but they will get there. cant wait to go back tomorrow for some delicious grub. the dj sean watson who is a local big time dj that played there on sunday was amazing as always and compliments to the ambiance of the place. this place is a hit and will do great!
great new restaurant with ample outdoor space. i got pasta and tuna which was really good. food is a generous portion as well. the girl across the bar was raving about this thai coconut soup so that will be next on the list. good location near downtown  central phoenix but has plenty of parking . park off flower. if youre a wine connoisseur then this is your place. there are little icons next to the each wine to explain the flavor. it was pretty busy so thumbs up to the curly brunette food runner working his butt off and running around
this place is the real deal. i was skeptical, but it did not disappoint. the food was unique and well executed. service was friendly and more than adequate. the design is gorgeous and the architecture sublime. cant wait to come back and try more cuisine.  we had small plates that were all exceptional. with all the many restaurants opening now, this one has that special something. congrats ocotillo, youre exceptional. cant wait to come back :
this place is a must!!! perfect ambience, location, classy food and wine.  this place knows how to pair ingredients, food and wine!  so good, be prepared to order the same thing again in one sitting!  once you experience, you are hooked!  brunch today was amazing and peaceful!  i cant say more other than go!  ill be visiting this week with my colleagues for lunch and ive found the perfect spot for any meal!  one word, amazing! check it out!
service was wonderful and the food was to die for... ambiance was amazing! i will definitely be back again soon and cant wait until they open for dinner this month!
hip new restaurant with fabulous service friendliness and creative food. loved the ambiance, outdoor patio.. cauliflower and beets were amazing. a great spot to spend my husbands birthday.
this is the place to go to celebrate vegetables. beets, cauliflower, broccoli, side dishes are amazing. the veggies are the stars and wonderfully done.
had an amazing time at this new spot.  went for brunch and with my girl and she loved it as well. great service and energy. i will definitely go back when im back in town.
exceeded my expectations.working in a kitchen has really ruined eating out for me in a lot of ways but mainly because i know what had to be done in most plates.. well ocotillo has seriously blown me away. the cocktail i had was excellently mixed, not too weak, not too strong, just right. then theres the burger.... amazing. a mixture of short rib, sirloin, and brisket in the patty with excellent caramelized onions and a fried egg on a brioche bun, i believe. if youre looking for a new place to check out for breakfast, brunch, and lunch i highly recommend ocotillo. also, they will be open for dinner starting november 19th. i think im going, how about you?
if you love sf, la and ny then make a beeline for ocotillo.  best new design in the valley with stunning indoor and outdoor spaces. fantastic, fresh, dimensional food. breakfast chimi, avocado toast, and bread pudding were all simple, memorable, and cravable.  plus a cool vibe, great music, and a hip urban crowd.  ocotillo just raised the bar for the phx restaurant scene. cant wait to see their upcoming dinner offerings!
cool italian mexican fusion mixed with a little vegetarian. excellent menu. very large restaurant with lots of space on the grounds. very new still have not started serving dinner but will in the next month. definitely worth coming down and checking out. will be an up and coming restaurant in this neighborhood.
the food was good, the portion sizes were pretty large but the overall vibe is really what makes me want to go back.
ive been here twice already for brunch and both times have been equally amazing. the atmosphere and layout of this place are so unique. its worth it to get here a little early to walk around and check it out. stop by the coffee shop and grab some coffee. the two girls that run the coffee shop are so nice and helpful! my first time here, we ordered our food from the coffee bar and just found a seat at a picnic table instead of waiting for the dining area.our second time here, i brought my father for his birthday. he loved this place as much as i did. he stopped by the coffee shop and tried the mole mocha which has great chile chocolate flavor. things to order:if you order something that doesnt come with hash browns, do yourself a favor and order a side of them to share with the table! the blue corn pancakes, roasted cauliflower, chimichanga and breakfast burger are some of my favorites. both times we have been here with a group of people and we all tried each others dishes. you really cant go wrong with anything you order. good portions and great flavor!
been here twice so far for brunch both times delicious.  great coffee game,  friendlyhelpful  staff,  beautiful design.
food and service were both incredible. im a vegetarian and they have plenty of options that are actually delicious. been for brunch and dinner and both were fantastic. so happy to have a place like this so close to my house now.
this place is amazing!!! i have been there twice. once for a private dinner party and once for the sunday brunch. the restaurant it more like a complex that has multiple areas for enjoyment. it has an outdoor park like setting, bar area, interior seating area, patio area and a coffee house. you can have a meal, lounge around while having cocktails or some coffee. the food is delicious!!! the portions are just right. i tried several appetizers that were all great. hands down it was the best steak and eggs i have ever had. the menu prices are reasonable for what you get.
i cannot wait to return. i came with two other women and we shared three small plates all veggies just to nibble while we chatted for an hour or so on a late evening. oh my goodness, each plate was to die for literally the best side dishes ive ever tasted. great job, chef. looking forward to returning for an actual meal.also love the modern atmosphere and feel of the dining space.
i think the space looks cool. 5 stars for that. brian watson the bar back is the shit!
i am reticent to put this review into the blogosphere fearing the challenges of getting a table once the foodies find their way  to ocotillo. yet in all fairness, there is not an experience like this in the state.we were told this concept was 4 years in the making and it sure is worth it. not many dining establishments can claim that its patrons will have a positively experiential time when coming in.  and ocotillo does not state this because we are!  what a free flowing design and layout.  clean bathrooms too!we showed up last friday afternoon 3:30pm after reading about it in the new times.we wanted an offpeak visit and this turned out to be a good move.upon entering the ocotillo campus from the rear parking lot one does not know what truly to make of it. there are open air dining areas with large park like tables as well as a casita like stand alone building for gourmet coffees and treats.once in to the main building, we were received immediately and granted our wish for a cozy booth. johnny, the newbie waitperson just in from alaska started off a bit cold, yet warmed up quickly. we tried a few tasty local brews from north mountain, yet were ravished.ordered the cabbageromaine salad with green tea dressing along with the roasted cauliflower with kale pesto dish. off the charts for creativity, presentation, portion size.of course we are foodie snobbish and ever since foxs tfktrue food kitchen appeared on the scene, it was a fav.  yet even tfk has not held up well in spite of the crowds. consistency of their dishes have been suspect.we then ordered the crispy falafel burger and were still all smiles.  johnny could not have been more accommodating to this picky twosome i must say.of course, it will be understandable that in peak hours, the experience could change.  yet we have sooo much more to try and are planning to bring our entire network of foodies.next time we are pondering, the pecan wood smoked beets  the fried zucchini  diver scallop ceviche with fresh coconut.yet this is but a sampling of ocotillos fare.  sooo much more along with the experiential nature of the campus like setting.heres hoping the masterminds of this establishment can keep this torch going for years to come.....
i have taken my fur baby to many groomers over the years, and the lovely people at furever are the real deal. heres why ill be returning:1 it is a familyowned shop. husband runs the front, and wife is the groomer. they are clearly animal lovers and treated my pooch like he was one of their own.2 excellent service and quality. our dog has mediumlength fur and was overheating from the heat and humidity. us, thinking it wouldnt be a big deal to give him the doggy equivalent of a buzz cut, asked them to do so.  in a professional but personable way, the groomer i forget her name explained that she  cant go too short on his fur, as it may cause skin problems, and he may even get a sun burn. duh, we thought. this is why you go to professional. in the end, our dog got an excellent cut exactly how we wanted and smelled like heaven.3 fast! ive taken our dog to groomers who have had him for 4 hours for a cut and wash. they had him in and out for the same in 2 hours. on a saturday!we are so happy to have found this great local grooming salon and will be happy to have them care for our little man in the future.
just moved from san francisco bay area to a new town not knowing anyone. i take finding new favorite places very seriously. so glad i can check favorite groomer off my list!from all the years of different groomers, ruby has never been as happy and comfortable. not only was her cut beautiful, they treated ruby like family. they are talented animal lovers, accommodating, quick, and priced reasonably. i called earlier in the morning and did not leave a message. i almost gave up on grooming ruby this week, but seeing the missed call, the owner called me back and took me in same day!the husband and wife team are awesome people and really enjoy what they do. this reflected in a great experience and product. rubys cut was even, her coat was shiny, she had a cute pink bow on her collar, and a dog smile on her facewhat else can you ask for?they have a repeat customer in me for sure.
run dont walk with your furry one to this groomer. they are very professional and my bichon frise never looked better. she wasnt nervous at all which is rare. very personable husband wife team are the owners, they explained everything in detail and are very thorough. ive paid more for much worse service at other groomers. they have a repeat customer in me!
i just got my dog back from the groomer. my dog buddy has never been groomed so well in his whole life im so glad i found this place.  the owners really do care about the dogs and it shows
absolutely amazing! nicest family youll meet: we have two siberian huskies that have never been to the groomer and are pretty shy around other peoplewell you wouldnt have guessed that! lol they did both of my dogs in three hours!! crazy ...and they looked stunningnice soft coat that smelled so good, all dried, nails clipped, pads trimmed and flea dipped for a great price! ill go back from now on :
the search for a good pet salon is over! furever pet salon is a dream come true!  the owners are the nicest people. our dogs were so happy to be there and, most importantly, happy when they came back!  joy, the groomer, does an incredible job, as does jim, her husband, running the business and helping you in and out of your car!  a service!  so happy to find a great salon in the east end!
love them!!! excellent excellent. best grooming salon in pittsburgh!!! welcome to squirrel hill!!!!
i have been looking for a groomer to take our labradoodle puppy to, not just to get him groomed, but to start getting him accustomed to the process and experience. from start to finish, i was impressed with this duo. they took a few minutes to let our pup play, get relaxed, ask me questions about what id like. he warmed up to them quickly, and although i heard some expected puppy whimpers, he came out looking great and with so much excitement. we think even he knew how great he looked!  we will definitely return not just for their great job and individualized service, but the care and kindness they displayed towards our pup on his first ever grooming experience.
what wonderful people!! they took such incredibly kind care of my scruffy little poodle, spending several hours making him over into a sleek, clean showstopper. they dont crate or cage dogs here; they work on your beloved poochie and only on your beloved poochie for as long as the job takes.
the owners of this salon were very accommodating and made an exception to groom our puppy before the holidays. they did a marvelous job and were very kind. we would definitely recommend this salon!
we stopped by this morning during their opening day. 5th element has a pretty cool story: coowned by todd allbaugh, a wisconsin native, and alejandro mendez, an el salvadorian and winner of the 2011 world barista championship. did you hear that? that means he was determined to brew the best cup of coffee in the world. and its opening right here next to us. im in.cool vibe, friendly service, and a strong, delicious cup of coffee. as it was opening day the line was out the door and things were a bit hectic, but owners and staff were extremely warm and engaging. paul simons graceland playing on the speakers, which i majorly dig. studyreading space in the back seemed ample. well be back.
youd be hardpressed to find better coffee in madison.prepared with passion, experience...the human elementthe 5th elementmmmmmmm...earth, water, air, and fire roasting.
the cappuccino is beautiful. you can tell that the barista put hisher heart in making this cup of coffee. love this place at the first visit.
not your average coffee shop. stop and sip the coffee. great quality coffee, skillfully prepared, chill atmosphere. the industrial layout contrasts the warmer wooden accents. i ordered a flat white. maybe it was that first cupoftheday bias, but it was the freshest, creamiest, most fullbodied cup of joseph i ever put in my mouth. then, i took an iced americano to go, because i definitely drank that flat white too fast. the first sip was tart, sweetening and deepening as the ice melted into it. god, it was good. theyre running low on iced coffee these days but they just ordered another gorgeous looking cold brew contraption to up their supply.several sprawling, wooden tables in the back provide ample seating and space for studying, if you dont mind sharing a table with others. the aluminum chairs are a nice aesthetic touch. i call these vampire chairs though, because they suck the heat from your body. probably a welcome experience for most people on a hot summer day!
traveling through for business from portland, or and its always a bonus to find a good coffee shop. i love my coffee and this place has it right, great stuff! ill stop by if in the area again, thanks guys!
best cup of decaf ever.  worth the wait for a quality cup of coffee. lots of outdoor and indoor seating.  great addition to the neighborhood.
msn just became a lot cooler...this place has a great story and a great vibe.  and, the iced coffee beats all. especially when its 95 outside.
excellent coffee, friendly and attentive service. finally, a coffee shop in madison that is actually 100 focused on the coffee! although 5th element is a great place to set up with a laptop or munch a delicious batch bakehouse pastry, the coffee reigns supreme here. the sleek, modern design by opn architects a local firm brings a different but sophisticated feel to the interior. sit down at one of the heavy wood tables and sip an artfully crafted mocha, taking time to appreciate the quality of the coffee, rich and full bodied but not too bitter. the presentation is done extremely well at 5th element, from the welldesigned interior to the cherryred mugs presented on a board with a tiny glass of water to stay hydrated. i highly recommend this place.
the proprietors at 5th element coffee know what theyre doing. there is proper attention given to every step of the coffee process, from the growing of the beans to the serving of the latte. this coffee shop specializes in beans from el salvador, where the shadegrown coffee beans are roasted in a light rather than dark way. the result is coffee that is especially smooth and quaffable without need for creamer or sugar. and thats the correct choice for their preferred methods of preparation  chemex, aeropress, pourover, and cold brew  which, because they are intended to be taken sans additives, are best brewed with beans that are not overroasted. even the water, which is otherwise disturbingly salty and metallic  has been processed to remove these impurities that would have seriously degraded the quality of the coffee. in short, the care and attention given to each cup of coffee really shows through in their final product.
outstanding shop. had an espresso and a latte here. espresso was pulled well but definitely not short. managed to maintain some bite while still delivering on the creaminess of a much shorter shot. not normally my style of shot as i like the sweet heaviness of a very short shot a la zumbar in san diego or vivace in seattle. the latte however is what blew me away. the flavors of the espresso really came through like im not used to in a latte. and the milk had to be some real wisconsin stuff. just awesome. hope to be back. thanks.
i visited this morning with my dad and brother. we expected a starbucksesque coffee shop, but were pleasantly surprised by the craft feel of the place. were not coffee aficionados, so they took the time to explain to us their offerings and show us the brewing methods. they even gave us a complimentary macchiatto after we asked a bunch of questions. our drinks were delicious, the service was great, and the atmosphere was cool. loved it!
superb coffee, best in madison.  cappucino is the litmus test, and it was superb.  need more nonperishable items to sell :
ive been thrilled with the last three visits to fifth element. the v60 was good but the chemex was outstanding. it sits next to jph for pour overs in madison. its waking distance from my house and has a good outmoded seating section which is an extra bonus.
im confident i will not find a cup of coffee this good ever again... unless i go back to 5th element, which i totally will! but seriously, the people here pay the utmost respect to coffeethe ingredients, the process, everything down to farming. theyre super nice and will share all of their knowledge with you, too! the coffee itself is just divine. divine as in the word youd use to describe an amazingly sinful dessert you just had, but its coffee. and its so good that you should stick to whats on the menu dont doctor it with your lowfat or soy milks because theyve perfected it all. this coffee is something specialsilky, never bitter, so enjoyable. i cant wait to see how this cafe takes off, because they totally deserve it.
the coffee here is delicious and meticulously prepared to order.  its fun to be served by knowledgeable coffee enthusiasts, too.  theres even convenient parking at the end of the block.
not only is this what the neighborhood really needed, but they set an exceptional bar for quality shots in madison. ive been going here since their first week and the espresso is consistently high quality with a great atmosphere and friendly baristas. baked goods from batch.
i really like this place. and its right by the med school which is very much appreciated. : i love their iced latte. one thing is that a 12 oz tastes better stronger than a 16 oz.. maybe their ratios are off or i just went on an off day? either way, this place gets 5 stars for great coffee and great service.
im not a coffee person. i drink it because 1 its warmhot and 2 it has caffeine. one of those sad sundays that i needed to get some stuff done, i decided to try somewhere new, hopped on bike, and headed towards state.while this is not exactly on state, its almost better for it. cute location a little out of the way, lots of seating, perfect for studyingcomputering! sadly no outlets outside, and a bit dark towards the back, but a very comfortable space.when i professed my lack of knowledge regarding coffee, the proprietor kindly pointed me to the cappucino when i mentioned i wanted something not too coffeey or bitter, something a little sweet. he explained that it was something to do with the beans and how they were roasted. and it was delicious!! love the setup with the sparkling water and the spoonfeast for eyes as well as a jolt to the soul. there are some nice baked goods as well as water. ill be back!
i was looking for a good place to work for the morning and wanted to also try a new coffee place.  5th element really fit.  their tables are pretty spacious and the wifi works well.  the coffee was exceptional and the atmosphere really conducive to getting something done.  glad i went.
i love this shop, a business worth patronizing!first and foremost, 5th element serves great coffee, not the blends served at most shops. they also serve delectable baked goods from the local batch house bakery. the contemporary design incorporates the wooden bowling alley lanes from wildcat bowling centers conversion to a church in nearby verona, utilized for paneling on the walls, the table tops and service counter. the highspeed internet service also makes for a productive study environment.beyond the tangible factors that one evaluates in choosing a coffee shop, this one is based on respect for the people who grow the coffee beans, going beyond fair trade requirements to establishing a partnership with the el salvadoran grower that ensures the wellbeing of those cultivating the crop. the owners have a zeal for taking care of people, not just their customers but also their suppliers. these people are the socalled 5th element that makes all the difference in enhancing the first four elements that produce the product they so passionately deliver.  as a customer, i feel honored to be part of this lofty process based on integrity and respect.
great coffee, great beans, great people, great ambiance. the coolest coffee shop in madison.
i really enjoy the food from chipotle, but this food is a lot better than any other chipotles i have been to. you can really tell the difference in quality, taste and texture. the food is made with love and care. yes the service is quite slow but this is a new location and i am pretty sure they will pick up speed. every time i go  which is three times a week it is packed full of people, the workers are consistently smiling and being kind to me and the other customers. would highly recommend this chipotle over others!
absolutely delicious mexican inspired tapas.  a few beers on tap, decent bottled beer and wine selection, and a respectable liquor selection with about ten chairs around a bar and two tvs.  small to average sized menu... everything was delicious and we just about tried it all.  desserts were fantastic as well!  looking forward to the next visit!
i stopped by for an early lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  the server taylor was excellent and had personality plus!  aaron owner was very gracious and came over to talk with me.  the menu is not large but varied, and i am already looking forward to trying the chorizo sliders next time.  i am not a big eater and feel that i waste a lot of food when dining out.  tapas portions are just perfect.  i had the brussel sprouts with caramelized onions and chorizo.  not only were they delicious, perfect in size, but also very reasonably priced.  be sure to try the sangria....very refreshing!
i want to start by saying that i normally do not have time to get online and write reviews for places but i had to for this place because it was amazing!! my mom had been here a couple of times already mind you, they havent been open very long but they are good enough for a repeat visit within a one week time span so she wanted us to come and check it out for our birthday! the restaurant was easy to find and the appearance was very welcoming a very clean and modern look!  the waitor greeted us immediately and knew the menu inside and out and explained everything to us in detail he was very knowledgable of the food and the drink choices so naturally we chose to start with strawberry habenero margaritas!! yumm! they were sweet and spicy and delicious! after the chef came out and greeted us and made sure that we were enjoying our drinks we chatted with him for a bit and  decided that we were going to do a tasting of the menu and try a little bit of everything. he immediately went and created a ceviche with the daily fish to start with. it was very light and refreshing and tasty it went perfectly with our drinks! the rest of the night was just plate after plate of incredible food! we had pork belly tacos, the moooo, chorizo sliders, brussel sprouts, etc. we even ended the night with two dessert choices, the chocotorta and some kind of tres leche with bruleed peaches! both were insanely good! i left the restaurant that evening so full and very satisfied. i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and i even plan on having them cater an event i have coming up! thanks for the great dinner and experience chef aaron!
my husband and i are huge fans of the food truck, chrome toaster. thus, after finding out that chef aaron opened up a restuarant in fort mill where the old passion 8 used to be, we had to go check it out!!we came here this past friday evening around 8:30pm or so. the place was busy but we were seated immediately. inside there are a good amount of tables, a large bar with numerous bar stools, and a side room with a large table that can be rented out for family events or to just casually sit at i have a large italian family that have to sit at the same table, so i can totally appreciate this room with a huge table in it!!!. there is also an outside patio with numerous tables and lighting. the place is decorated, for lack of a better word, very cute!my husband ordered the duck rabbit stout the local beer selection was excellent!!! and i got the habanero strawberry marg. the margarita was absolutely delish and a perfect mix of spicy and sweet!we ordered four different things on the menu to share....since it is a tapas style restuarant. they came out at different times but there was never a long wait in between, which was perfect!! we got the shrimp pupusa anyone that knows me knows i love pupusas!!, brussel sprouts, tamale special of the day, and the duck confit tacos special of the day. the shrimp pupusa was definitely the highlight....so many awesome flavors and the shrimp were nice sized! the sprouts were perfectly cooked and the chorizo was a great flavor touch! the tamales were nice and light came with two. lastly, the duck tacos came with 3. man, such a great end to the meal!!! chef aaron stopped at all the tables throughout the night just to check on everyone and make sure they enjoyed their food, which i thought was a nice touch! this is such a great local place that truly makes an emphasis to serve delicious food with quality ingredients. i am so excited that tapas 51 will be added to list of incredible, locally owned restaurants with the charlotte area!
this place was amazing! the decor, food, and cocktails truly encompass the tapas vibe! the patio is the perfect place to enjoy a cold festive drink, on a hot summer night!  we cant wait to come back!
i just had lunch there and it was so freakin delicious. every single thing was spot on! i cannot wait to go back. my favorite was the duck egg poutine dipping yucca fries in the egg yolk was to die for. you must go! best food ive had out in awhile!!!!
we just happened to be passing through fort mill and the wife and i were starved. we had a series of unfortunate events trying to find a restaurant that was open and to our liking. clearly someone was looking out for us because we wound up at the right place. tapas 51 is in the old passion8 location with a whole new decor. the wife and i split the daily special ceviche of nc bass, shrimp papusa, yucca poutine, daily special snapper tacos, brisket tacos and the pot brownie for dessert.everything was packed with fresh flavors and simply prepared. they used a lot of interesting plating devices like pieces of wood and ceramic tiles. the service was attentive and informative at answering questions. the yucca poutine was very good with all the components prepared and matched well. as a french canadian, i would like to see them change poutine to poutine on the menu or maybe call it a south american poutine. still a great dish, but us french canadian are protective of our poutine. i just wish tapas 51 was closer. maybe a second location in noda?
guys. this place is amazing. i mean, i cant even tell you how delicious the food is here. super flavorful, fresh and legit. def one of my fav places in charlotte.
we are from san diego and are always searching for good mexican food.  this qualifies! a gem. pleasant find.  we will be back and will bring friends.  very unique flavor combinations.  good food.  good service!
if you dont know what tapas is or dont like tapas.. dont come here and then write a one star review because the portions are teeny, tiny... its tapas! its not golden corral.the food here is sublime. get the grilled shrimp pupusa. the conchita pibil belly taco and bok bok chicken chicken are also very good. street corn rocks and my wife says the brussel sprouts were fantastic.
this place was fabulous.  we loved everything. a definite hidden gem. we will be recommending this to friends.
fabulous combination of flavors and textures. we have been looking for something unique and fresh.  as there arent many good tapas in the area. we enjoyed 8 of the menu items and none disappointed. chorizo sliders.. very flavorful.  brightened up interior and great outdoor seating.
this restaurant was a great find through yelp and i did not know what to expect.  i thought it was mexican but then it said tapas which traditionally is spanish but to my surprise it was tapas style but inspired by the entire a culinary mixture of different latin american dishes.we ordered the grilled shrimp pupusa and it was awesome. the yucca huancaina poutine which was good, the cochinita pibil belly that was so tender and flavorful, and the taco of the day which was a sword fish with a delicious cream.  once done our server alyssa asked if we had room for dessert so she about to recite the offerings and the first thing mentioned was the tres leches.  i quickly halted her and asked to say no more and to get me teh tres leches.  it was to die for.
just had lunch here. we only ordered 2 dishes , the coffee crusted brisket tacos and chorizo brussels sprouts. the flavors were amazing in both dishes. sangria was good, too! the restaurant was easy to find and the waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable. cant wait to go back and try other items on the menu.
wonderful place! ambience is nice, food awesome and service very good. unique menu too!!
tapas 51 is a hidden gem. we were starving after a fun day at carowinds and looking for a healthy option nearby. we definitely did not expect the incredible, affordable culinary creations we feasted upon at tapas 51. every single dish is so carefully crafted to form the perfect combinations of savory and sweet, spicy and creamy. the brisket chorizo tacos, the shrimp papusa, and the chocotorta are absolute musts. the chorizo brussels sprouts and the sweet corn were also fantastic. i could not recommend a restaurant more. definitely coming back.definitely recommend sharing as well
the shrimp papusa is probably the best thing ive eaten in a long time. everything was so delicious, innovative and flavorful. i cannot wait to go back!
i normally dont like tacos, and have never tried a popusa, but let me tell you this place is amazing! wow, there food is so good. they modernized a plain taco  popusa with flavor that just works! they also have a school bus called, the chrome toaster, which is available for parties. love this place..
this place is amazeballs. it doesnt look like much from the outside, but the second you walk in, there is a warmth and minimalist but lovely atmosphere. then, once you taste the food, you stop caring about what the inside of this place looks like because you have to leave and go slap your mama because its that damn good. the brisket tacos are unlike anything of the same name that you have ever tasted before, the street corn will henceforth be the corn that all other corn is measured against, and the shrimp papusa is this explosion of all these flavors so delicious that you wont even want to swallow ahem, sorry. oh and the butternut squash gnocchi in the chorizo sauce with the queso fresco cheese??? make like nike and just do it. go here,  you wont be sorry, i promise. one of the best tapas places ive ever had the privilege of dining at. yep, ended that sentence in a preposition but i dont care bc this place made me not care.
i stopped in for lunch. being that these are small plates and most people will want 1.5 to 2 plates it can be a little expensive for lunch. that said the food was excellent. i had the shrimp ceviche and realizing the small portion i also ordered the chicharrones. both were excellent with great flavors. i have to go back and try the tacos. my other concern is that it wasnt busy, so please go. also the location is horrible so you wont accidentally find it.
little yellow house with a graveled drive but looks are definitely deceiving here. the inside is spotless and very modern with a full bar and friendly staff. started out with their signature strawberryhabanero margarita.  unique, and served in a tall glass with lots of lime, ice and a pink himalayan salt rim. basically, we tried almost everything on the menuwell there were 4 of usand each dish was better than the last. the corn tortillas are hand made and each dishes attention to detail makes the dining experience one of a kind. loved the ravioli and the roasted corn was delicious    save room for dessert the chocotorta with a homemade toasted marshmallow on top and french press coffee with very thick cream.
the hubby and i were up for trying a new place and saw the great reviews for tapas 51. it did not disappoint! the menu is relatively small, however it still gives variety without being overwhelming. i wish i could have tried one of everything, but we ended up choosing the beef empanadas, lamb mole and pork belly tacos. all delicious. i wish i could have tried the ceviche but am 5 months pregnant at the moment so will have to save it for another time! the staff was very attentive and courteous. its definitely off the beaten path and very unassuming you wonder if youre in the right spot when you pull up for the first time. it was fairly empty for a saturday night, but im hopeful that business will pick up and they can keep their doors open!
stumbled across this joint going to the dollar store nextdoor, boy am i glad that i did!they were advertising juices for a very affordable price, half of what nekter charges.  the juice itself was very sweet and delicious! i ordered the carrot juice!originally thats all i was going to get but then i saw the roast beef sandwich that one of the workers was eating and i ordered that as well! it was so good they roast it themselves and make all ingredients by hand! the recipe was from the owners mother!i then ordered a cupcake and iced coffee, still everything very reasonably priced! very tasty! again, the cupcake was home made!this place is five stars! hand made ingredients makes you feel like youre eating in a traditional home!
great place to eat. everything tasted amazing and staff was super friendly!! cant wait to return
nice cute kitchen with a home grown small town feel where they treat every customer like a friend. food is great. would recommend!
i am very picky when it comes to anything from a bakery. i loved loved loved everything  about this place! the juices are great, the bread is homemade and the texas sheet cake is the best ive had outside my own mothers kitchen. highly recommend it!
the service was great , the food had flavor and tastes like a home cooked meal !! definitely worth stopping in ,i cant wait to try more things on menu take out dinners
the food was excellent, the service was great and the morning glory muffins were delicious.  i also had a very tasty mango smoothie.  the price was good for the portions of food served.
the food is excellent! as a young, working adult, i find little time to cook as much as i would like.  gabrielas helps take care of that.  if you like authentic, homestyle comfort food, this is your place.  gabriela and the staff are so friendly.  my orders and personal stories are remembered when i returned, which gives the extra touch anyone can appreciate.  you can subscribe to a weekly menu to preview or schedule future orders.  i had the beef and green chile stew with rice and beans tonight.  delicious!
this place came recommended by a friend and it was lovely. the people are welcoming, thoughtful and helpful we have small children. the food and juice is super tasty!
i order take out dinners for my family regularly, food and service is excellent!  i love that they have their daily dinner menu online.  frequently around 3pm i realize i wont have time to make a healthy dinner for my hubby and kiddos so i call gabrielas and presto, an amazing dinner at a reasonable price is ready for pick up!  love this place :
the food is really good and fairly priced. the owner is really nice. its like going into someones home for a meal. we will be returning soon. ive tried the red chili which was really good. the meat loaf was good too, and the sandwiches are not either.
the breakfast sandwich didnt last half a mile! that fresh baked roll was a pillow sent from heaven. anxious to try more
super petit bijou du quartier. le staff est super accueillant et sympathique. et la nourriture.. waow ! les sandwich sont divins et les cakes fondent dans la bouche. a essayer !
one of the best sandwich shopscafes ive been to in a while. my friend and i had 2 different, equally delicious sandwiches and a couple of the italian pastries for dessert. the coffee was also excellent, and the owner i think even gave us a few delicious cold espressos to enjoy on the terrasse next to his tomato garden. will be going back as soon as possible!
in the heart of villeray, located on a very quiet street away from the main villeray artery, pinocchio is a family run italian cafe like a lot of other italian cafes.the place is small, as small as vito but with a lot less seats. during summer, its not too bad as the terrace is quite nice. the terracegarden is something you could have at home. as for colder days, i do not know how thats going to work. it could have more seats if it wasnt taken over by a fridge and whatnot.as you enter, youre welcomed with open arms and smiles. the times i went were on weekend and the vibe is that of visiting your gramps. only thing missing would be some kiss and cheeks pinching. not only do you feel like youre family but i got treated to some goods on the house. first time, it was some cookies. last time, i just happened to be at the right place at the right moment as a patron brought a box of cannoli from a baker on jeantalon as a gift to the family owners. what did the owners do? offers cannoli on the house to every patrons that were there. i was all set on getting a slice of kouignamann because yes, they offer kouignamann from kouignamann amongst other things instead, free cannoli. cant complain.as for coffee, i always went with the cappuccino. while not the best, still a very good cappuccino. first time, i was served by the son and got a nice little chat to get a pulse on the place and his idea of a good coffee. turns out, we have similar coffee taste and thats what they are trying to do in that neck of villeray hood, offers goodgreat coffee.i did get a glimpse of their sandwiches on my last visit which are made with ingredients from shops nearby. from what i saw, they are huge sandwiches at a decent price. as for baked goods, some come from la cornetteria. others from the baker nearby and so.in summary, not the best italian coffee still too new but the whole family, friends, gramps vibe of the place make this cafe a must stop by. mind you, dont come in expecting free baked goods but do expect to be treat like family.
tres bon cafe. proprio sympathique. un peu petit, mais vient douvrir. definitivement a essayer :
what can i say...just an amazing place to be...coffee is great and the people are super friendly. the sandwiches are just to die for,,,,and the pastries and cakes superb..the place has just added extra seating by removing  the large fridge..so more seating .  the terrace is a bonus in this area..most  new coffee  shops in villeray barely have a toilet to use...this place is the hidden jewel of villeray.a defenite cafe to see in villeray...no rush..no gossip..no problem...a family vibe.. and the prices are just incredible for what they give you..at any given time a family member is here to help you with anything you  wanna eat or drink...tell your friends to pass by...you wont regret it.
my boyfriend and i picked this place at random and it was the perfect choice; this place was absolutely fantastic. they have 72 beers on tap, which were all great options. the menu is made up of just burgers, but they are all funky and sound amazing. i have the brewschetta burger, which was absolutely phenomenal. my boyfriend moaned through his whole bacon mac n cheese burger. the waitstaff was super friendly and more than willing to bring over samples of any beers you wanted to try. i highly recommend stopping here.
there are bars, and then there are bars that know what they are trying to be.  mr. brews has a working recipe in both beer and service, and they know it.madison is quickly filling up left and right with random places that are cashing in on the trendy, hipster, does everything bar scene and it doesnt always work out too well.  without naming names   its fairly easy to post a sign on your door that says that you have a million and one beers on tap even if youre actually just repeating taps, that you serve the greatest bar food since buffalo put some hot sauce on leftover wing parts, and that your staff can have your food ready in ten seconds.  that doesnt make you new and different.mr. brews, on the other hand, has a recipe that works well, and theyve proven it by and through staying power.  bars in madison tend to come and go, and i see mr. brews staying.  i visited their waunakee location, and was pleased to see a downtown madison location open that ive now been to many, many times  enough to confidently give what would have been a fourstar rating a solid five.  their location is not only a good one, but the place itself is spacious, comforting, and inviting.  its the place id think of if i wanted to meet up with a friend, or relax and enjoy an afternoon.  you can hear yourself think, and the windows afford a great view of state street for people watching.as another rater stated, this bar had some growing pains, and adapted throughout its opening weeks.  however, my ratings for bars are generally different than restaurants  but most always start off at three stars bars are bars and go up or down based on two things:  service and unique qualities.  ratings are high.the service at this particular mr. brews is fantastic.  ive come in now during busy and lean times, and the staff is extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive.  they have the perfect im ready to order eye and can tell when youre not interested in talking, and when you need someone to come over and ask hey, do you need any suggestions?  thats service above and beyond, and its much appreciated in a world of bars that open boasting more beers than youll ever be able to drink in your lifetime, because honestly  anyone that says they know their way around those ridiculous 700 beer menus is a complete liar what in the world is a kolsch?.  you need the bartenders help, and mr. brews staff is ready to be helpful, humble, and not too overly opinionated on the fact that they have the entire list memorized and yes, theyre prepared to help you even if all youve ever had is a bud lite.im not terribly pleased with the menu layout, but the fairenough reasoning that ive gotten is that mr. brews actually changes their kegs so often that theyve had to go through different methods of keeping their menus uptodate.  they are still figuring that one out  so ill give them a fair break if theyre not the prettiest yet.  im there to drink and scoff at beer, not admire paper. the niceties that i really enjoy about the bar that keep me coming back is the price on the beers, theyre deceptively low.  not only is almost every single beer available for free tasting and its not a secret, they tell me every time i sit down, they offer 7 oz. small glasses, and the sizes just go up from there.  beers do go up to 20 oz. large glasses possibly larger but im not a huge glass fan and the most ive dropped on a beer so far was around 10 for the more expensive imports.  if i want to sit and sample all night on flights, i think ive dropped a cool 6070 before ive gone through 1520 beers and im completely done for the day.the burgers are more of a novelty for me.  some arent a huge fan of the fact that they cant be cooked to order.  i dont know the story behind why that is, but i can only speculate that it has to do with making life easy in a place that focuses more on beer than the burgers.  so far every burger ive had has been delicious, and i like mine medium rare  it truly hasnt been a big deal for me.  i suppose i should or could care more, but the monthly burger was a honey jalapeno and it blew me away, so im not complaining.i will say that to go over the top, this bar needs to incorporate something else as a draw.  an expanded appetizer menu would blow people away  beer pairs well with other things than burgers.  the pub fries are fantastic, but now thats just two major items.  if you arent in the mood for a burger or the fries, you might be out of luck there.  options are the friend of the pub, because all one has to do is go down the street and compromise on the 100 beers on tap if your hunger starts to outweigh your thirst people drink at 12 tap bars.service is amazing here, so i doubt that will ever be a problem.  brews is likely here to stay, im just hoping for an expanded menu so that theres more to fill stomachs while sipping the amazing selection that changes seeming daily.
i have had nothing but exceptional service at the downtown mr. brews. i love to try new beers and the staff is great about offering recommendations and personalized attention. this is my favorite place to bring friends for a beer. the flights are a bargain!
ive only gotten takeout from this place so im not really going to speak to the service and the atmosphere.  after visiting mr. brews on the west side we started ordering from this location because it is much closer to our house.  weve been here 34 times already.  why takeout?  well, aside from the fact that we often like to order takeout, it is very difficult to find parking close to this location, especially free parking.  ive placed orders here and it consistently takes them less than 10 minutes to get everything together.  the quality of the food is pretty  much identical to the mr. brews on the west side as far as i can tell.  the kentucky bourbon burger is a favorite, in my opinion with a delicious bourbon mayo and a few delicious strips of crispy bacon.  my husband has tried the california burger as well and thought it tasty as well.  we usually order the pub chips as well which come topped with bacon, scallions and their homemade beer cheese sauce.  this is an excellent place to get a hamburger and fries.
first of all, love the look of this location!  i would much rather buy local and come to mr. brews than go to some national chain.  the beer selection is awesome, the food is good, and the atmosphere is energetic.
best sonoran hot dogs on this side of town!! i was so obsessed with them that i would have them every weekend while away in europe for 2 months this is the only thing thing i craved from here! they are opened until 2 am on weekends and they!
lupita goes the extra length to make sure were taken care of. very warm and welcoming. and the hotdogs are fantastic, especially with the mexican sodas. a wonderful discovery and best of all shes open late! be sure to bring cash.
the best sonoran hotdogs ever!!! you want to bring friends and family to come and try it out.
fresh and tasty sonoran hot dogs. doesnt get much better. very nice people also. 17 for 5 hot dogs and coke. bar with all the side fix ins but it doesnt need it.
really tasty old school sonoran hot dog cart!  friendly ladies show lots of pride in their business.  more diverse crowd than i was expecting.  will return for sure.
jessica is an amazing hair stylist! i am super picky and know what i like and she takes her time to understand the look i am going for. she is very talented as she went to one of the best cosmetology schools in the nation. she is so kind, patient, and easy going. i love the studio she works out of too!! its cute, clean, and in a great area of tempe. i am always happy with the results of my hair and eyebrows when i leave jessicas chair! i feel beautiful and confident! i recommend her to everyone!
jessica is amazing!!! she is seriously a hair fairy. i am so glad i found her because she always takes her time and makes sure that your hair turns out how you want it. i usually get a full head of blonde highlights and she puts more foils in my hair than any other hair stylist i have ever seen, and it always turns out super blonde just how i like it! i would recommend her to anyone and everyone! i really love that she takes the time before every appointment to really understand and talk about the look that you want to achieve, and explains how she will accomplish it. i have never left her salon unhappy! you need to go see her!i found her randomly online and decided to take a chance and see a hair stylist that i had never met before. i can not explain how glad i am that i took that risk, because i found my forever hair stylist. thank you for always making my hair amazing jessica!
dana really is the best! ive been going to her for almost 12 years and i wouldnt think of going to anyone else. my cuts are always awesome and easy to manage, and my highlights consistently look like my hair has been naturally sunkissed exactly what i asked for!. i always leave with smooth, shiny, fabulous hair and feel like a million bucks. shes also just a very friendly and warm person, which makes for a fun visit. i cant recommend her highly enough.
dana is amazing. my hair was long overdue for a haircut, so dana had her work cut out for her when i arrived. it was my first time in her chair, so i wasnt sure what to expect, but i had nothing to worry about  she was so personable when discussing what i wanted to do with my hair. she knew exactly what i needed and i walked out of the salon with bouncy, shiny hair. im very happy with her work and plan to keep her as my new goto stylist.
one word to describe dana as a stylist is amazing!!!! ive been a client of hers for over a decade and would never go anywhere else. dana does the best hair extensions in town. her knowledge of color is truly cutting edge. dana has a true talent to make your hair stunning. you will definitely look like a million bucks after a visit with dana.
the beef at haggens is the best in town. same beef echo and rig uses. better quality and has flavor unlike the beef at other grocers in town. better than costco, smiths, albertsons and vons. you can throw in the butcher shops in town to. the new yorks grilled on the bbq were like eating fine beef at a steakhouse in the midwest.
i see these reviews that dont give the formally known as von summerlin haggens store good feedback. i want to let everyone know, that as a regular customer to the former vons and now haggens grocery store, i truly appreciate the stores small town feel with them actually purchasing from local vendors. the prices are comparable to albertsons, vons and much cheaper than the natural organic products store, such as trader joes or whole foods, while still providing organic products. the store still has an amazing selection and a variety of products and in a lot of cases are less than the albertsons which is closer to my home but i choose to go to the haggens on my way home from work, despite not being the closes grocery store. i am glad to know the friendly faces that were with vons, even with the store transition, are still the friendly faces i see at haggens. they all enjoy their job and have nothing but great things to say about the haggen brand products and are excited and speak highly about the company. i dont see a change in the cost of my over all bill but even if the cost was more, it sure cant top the clean environment,  the fresh feel, great floral selection, and a staff that goes out of their way to ensure that i am satisfied at the end of my shopping experience.
haggen its new in vegas i like it the best super market in town !!!
im letting all of you know that angry crab peoria, is now open!they dont do barbecue or pizza like some of their sister restaurants in phx, mesa and the tukee here its all about crab, shrimp, crawfish, crab legs, mussels, clams, oysters, po boys, catfish and several other things that swim. pro tip: dress down because you will get messy. need to take a shower soon after dining messy. might wanna drive through a car wash with the windows down messy. but it will be worth it. the staff is very friendly and if you need help tying up your bib, theyll hook you up.its across from lee lee, on cactus, just west of 75th ave and at least for now, only open for dinner from 410, 11pm on fri  sat. the atmosphere and vibe is so unlike anything else in the area, and of course, so is the menu. ive been waiting on the open sign in the front window to be turned on for about 4 months. its a long overdue interesting addition to the neighborhood and im glad its finally open!
my husband surprised me with a surprise visit to the grand opening.  service seemed to run smoothly, with little noticed as far as opening mishaps.  we were greeted and sat immediately.  the menu was what you would expect from a louisiana seafood boil spot.  we ordered the mussels, snow crab, and shrimp; level 2 trifecta.  our order came out quickly, and the food did not disappoint.  the shrimp were large, the mussels were to die for, and the snow crab...well was crab legs, amazing!  we will definitely be back, we have a couples date night coming up, and this is the perfect spot.  i am so happy they built this spot right up the street.  love it!!!  must try!!!
finally open in peoria! i have been to the other locations but they are really far away for us. this location opened yesterday and did not disappoint at all. the food is incredible and this location seems to have a couple extra options the others do not. if you have never been here and like seafood you must come here. if you have already been here you know exactly what i am talking about. a all the way.
how can you not love this place??   price is steep but once a month is ok lol!!   got to have my  2lbs king crab hahaha
it was a busy friday night! they told us the wait was about 45mins... well 15 mins later, i got a text saying that our table is ready, awesome! aaron, our server was nice and accommodating. i ordered my usual shrimp trifecta mild and my friend ordered the soft shell crabs with a side of cajun fries. the fried crabs were huge, it comes with a dipping sauce and a side of coleslaw and lots of cajun fries. my trifecta shrimp was very juicy  its finger licking good.. with lots of lemon juice! from mesa, to phoenix, and now here in peoria.. my experience is always great!
this place is absolutely amazing. i came in with my family last night and sara was our server and she showed great customer service as well as everyone else who came in contact with our table. i ordered the shrimp trifecta level 2 and it was to die for. i will be in again very soon to try more stuff. this place is my new favorite seafood restaurant. will be recommending this place to everyone. keep up the great work.
ok i normally stay away from seafood places away from home. my uncle wasted to try it so we did. omg!! oh yea!!! had the blue crab and they are intact! get them trifecta with more spices and they are perfect. they are boiled perfectly and are fresh well what i had  they fly them in fresh! the garlic was like candy and went so well the crab. this is all coming from someone from new orleans! very impressed!
great food!!  great service.....thank you ashley!!  if you like medium hot...start with the mild.  the flavors were excellent!
food was fantastic!  everything we had was delicious.  snow crab, onion rings, hush puppies, everything!  the manager was great. we will be back again and again!
the kids  i thought we would check it out. we got right in at 4:30. place is already busy. all the tables full by the time we left at 5:30. had the shrimp, mussels and snow crab. going with level 0 next time. amy was great at making sure we had all our food and keeping the drinks filled. we would like to come back.
omg! best seafood around. 1st timers  we loved everything we ordered! fried clams, snow crab legs  lobster oh my! well be back soon.
i gotta do a huge shout out to some amazing people who tonight made a monthly dinner outing for a group of moms fun  a record for most attending. ...diana mgr, daniel gm and steve best server as well as the others who helped thank you!!!!the special treatment was greatly appreciated and the food was fantastic!!!!!i must say, i am an official angry crab fan and highly reccomend this place .
went to the angry crab to celebrate my wifes birthday. diane and her staff were spot on, we had a party of eight and drinks, appetizers and dinner all came together and everything tasted amazing!  this is definitely our go to place!
great place! im happy i have one near where i live! service, ehhh. the place gets busy pretty fast once they open, so hurry up!
great atmosphere, even better food. you will be hard pressed to find seafood as fresh as this anywhere else in arizona. the boils were absolutely top notch so much butter!. had steve as a waiter and we knew that he was busy but we felt like we were his only table. he was so personable and totally went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. the manager diana banana and the blonde hostess with glasses didnt catch her name were so friendly!steve told us about a secret traditional level 6 sauce with carolina reaper peppers. it lit me up, but i could not stop eating it! the head chef who doesnt like being called a chef is a genius of sauces. there was so much flavor and so much heat packed into that sauce.the beer selection is unparalleled; you can tell that every craft beer, most of which are local, were specifically picked to go perfect with the food.we have been loyal hnj patrons, but we have just found our new favorite spot.
i went to the angry crab last night and decided to dine at the bar with a couple friends. it was our first time and we had no idea what to order or what we would like, i just have to say they have the best bartender who was so incredibly helpful! chris helped us get our order in, which took us probably 10 minutes to understand the saucesspices, btw the drinks he made us were amazing! great service, great food and great drinks. thanks chris, i hope you work next friday : i highly recommend!
so my wife and 15 mo old daughter went for the first time 1122. i wasnt really sure how much i was going to like it. but gave it a shot anyways. this place blew us away. we had snow crab legs. shrimp and mussels. all were fantastic. steve our server was very helpful. also, if they say its going to be hot and messy, trust them.  i think we met the owner as well. i just had a mouthful of food everytime she came around. genuinely nice people. would very much recommend this place.
the food here was great and it was the most fun eating out of a plastic bag i have ever had! we will definitely be back!
extraordinary gumbo....great po boy.....this is going to require many trips to get through all their wonderful offerings!  fabulous beer selection.....environmentally aware...astonishing wait staff  helpful, fun....and they sing!!!!  do not pass up a chance to experience cajun cuisine right here in peoria!  laissez les bon temps rouler!!!
went there last night with my family. great atmosphere and the service was great. sara was our server and she did a great job. the one thing that made this restaurant different from other places we have visited was everyone was attentive to our needs.
unbelievable experience! everything was perfect and the service was exceptional. make sure to order the fried oysters. you will be extremely happy with your choice and you get a bunch for only 7 bucks! we are definitely coming back again.
we went here for dinner on friday, our first time. what an awesome place, with great food.gotta give a shot out to our bartenderserver ashley. she was very helpful and informative on the menu. made our experience worth this post and will have us coming back. :
too much fun!  our annual holiday lunch was a messy bunch of fun today.  the trifecta sauce is the way to go.  combo of cajun, lemon pepper and garlic.  i had clams, a friend had shrimp and snow crab, another just snow crab.  we added the corn and potatoes.  great sweet potato fries.  i ordered oysters, but they are pacific, bigger and stronger, not my favorite.  fried clams were better.  try a cranberry moscow mule yummy!  i will be back.  ashley was the woman!!
the peoria location is the best thing to happen to peoria!!!!! great food good drinks and friendly staff to take care of your needs... open for lunch now at 11:00 a.m. and happy hour to from 3 until 6. the best!! thank you for coming west ........ and if you love sea food and reading this log out and get out go get some angry crab.peoria residentkc
my wife and i had a fun time getting our hands full of shrimp, snow crab, sausage, potatoes, and vegetables.  we liked the backyard atmosphere.   we enjoyed the various staff stopping by to chat and offering suggestions for ordering and managing our meal.  it was like having all the neighbors at a bbq.  the food was excellent  we ordered everything trifecta style.  matt and will were great.
what a meal!!!! this was our first visit on a whim. i got a large peach margarita. the hubby got a large homemade sangria. both were really good and worth the around 9 price better then chilis and 3 times the amount. they bring chips and salsa to the table and we ordered a small guacamole. the guacamole was huge for 3.99  and really good. we added some salt to make it pefection. husband ordered the fajitas fiesta. 17.99 and he could not finish. i got the pollo alcapoco. once again ate about half. we will be back no doubt.
my husband and i tried out la fiesta grande last night for dinner, and we werent disappointed!  we were greeted and seated immediately, and the service was very timely.  our waitress was very nice and friendly.  we got a pitcher of margaritas, which were deliciousnot too sweetsyrupy!  he got enchiladas and i got a tacoboth were fresh and scrumptous.  i really appreciated being able to order just one taco plus rice and beans, since most restaurants require you to get 3 or more per meal.  note: you can order three tacos as well!basically: the food was fresh and tasty, the service was friendly and tasteful, the restaurant itself is clean and beautifully decorated.  we will be back!
we stopped in last sunday evening and sat outside on the patio. the food was delicious and the service was great!
amazing pizza! all ingredients imported from italy. the service was wonderful. definitely the best pizza in town.
absolutely spectacular pizza. this is clearly the best option in town and already one of a very few restaurants that i will recommend to visitors as a must. the pizza pomodorini is currently my favorite. the crust is thin and crisp, the ingredients are high quality and fresh, and the ovens bring a dimension that you cant find anywhere closer than chicago. easy five stars.
im picky on pizza...  this is fantastic italianstyle pizza with quality ingredients.  i will be back.  there is no equal in cmi for this style of pizza.
hands down one of the best pizza places in champaign. the high quality ingredients make all the difference. i like that the owners are always on site and very personable. theyre also in the works of adding a an espresso baritalian gelateria as well. score!theyre brand new so they are still figuring things out, but its working. this is a perfect addition to downtown.
this place is amazing! as an italian, i could not believe that these guys are making every day delicious pizza in a perfect napoli style. but the absolutely are. and its not just that: the environment is friendly and relaxed, making you feel like at home. in summary: here you can find amazing italian pizza and starters, without the useless formalism of other socalled italian restaurants, which for me represents the best combination. a nice plus? the imported italian beer and wine.
this place is the best pizzeria in champaignurbana! their pizza is delicious and made from fresh ingredients. and the staff are super friendly and helpful. we were there for birthday of one of my friends with around 30 people and it went all great. this place is great for having your events with a selection of their wines to serve your guests.
its quite delicious and the ingredients seem very fresh. this is a good option when you are downtown at some of the bars without a kitchen too.
best pizzzzza in champaign!
great quality and atmosphere. we got the margherita and diavolo. both were really good but i loved the diavolo it had a good amount of spicy. the pizzas have this great texture, like a thin crispy but chewy texture. im probably describing it incorrectly. definitely would go again but probably not too often, prices are a bit on the high side :
italian husband is so excited to find finally neapolitan pizza in cu and they use quality ingredients, not the usual horrendous american cheeses and topics.
this is the place to go for authentic italian woodfired pizza. the ingredients are fresh and you can tell the owners are really passionate about the food they make. the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and the pizzas come out fast! i highly recommend stopping in and getting the best pizza youll find in champaign.
we decided to try pizzaria antica and were very happy with it. the pizza is delicious with wonderfully  fresh ingredients; the gelato was terrific. it is interesting in its design, and the owners are friendly and helpful. give it a try; you wont regret it!
i absolutely love this place.  they are pricey, but when the price is worth it, i will recommend it highly. i had a large gathering of twelve people and seven pizzas covered it perfectly.  they came out in waves, and people got to try different flavors.  the idea is to have an italian and locally sourced pizza that is delicious and woodfired.  it is not your usual fare in the cu area, which thrills me.  the owner appreciates the work in putting quality  food forth as well as the care for his customers and employees.  try to tip and you will find out how he cares for his employees.  he fully appreciated the smalltown feel of cu and i hope that we show this place the same care.  if you frequent quality, they deliver there...but because of the way the pizza is made, yes...you will not want it delivered.
the pizza is great much improved from when they opened and they use great ingredients. give pizza antica a try. it is worth it. informal and warm environment. great if you have kids!
love the food here.  my guess is the people who dont like it just arent a fan of the style of pizza.   because the quality is excellent.  but woodfired is obviously going to taste differently than deep dish papa dels :

fit frenzy is the one of the best parts of my life. if you want an excellent workout by two great trainers this place is a must try. you will feel welcomed and part of the fit frenzy family on your first visit. the workouts are changed daily so you dont get bored. i lost 19 body fat in four months. i recommend the first timer or the bored with the same old gym routine to come give it a try you wont be disappointed.
fit frenzy helps me jump start my day.  the trainers there, are so knowledgeable of how exercise works for all of us differently.  they are inspiring, motivating, and cheer us all on.  we are all their for a purpose, but its so great to feel so uplifted and ready for the day.  come in and check it out, you wont be disappointed.

i cant speak for anyones past experience, but my experience was outstanding! i was referred to rob by a friend. he told me they were in the process of moving their shop, but he still responded quickly to my emails. all of my questions were answered quickly and professionally. i emailed my ideas in and they came back with exactly what i wanted. when i picked up my shirts today they were perfect! i could not be happier! one of the things i love about anything inked and more is they are a locally owned family business! the new shop just opened either yesterday or today so they were still setting things up but the shop is great! there are windows into the shop so you can watch how things are made. the location is great right off 95  cheyenne. they dont just do shirts either. they do pens, water bottles, lanyards, literally anything! do yourself a favor  give them your business. you wont be disappointed! i will definitely be using them again!062315  update not only was my initial experience outstanding, one of the parents gave me the wrong size for their boy. i contacted richard, and he made another shirt in the correct size. the mistake was completely my fault, but they still took care of us! great customer service!
this place is so awesome. richard the owner was so helpful and the girls that work there are super friendly and caring. they go out of their way to get you exactly what you want. their screen printing guy is the best in las vegas, hes been doing it for like 3040 years. im so happy with the finished product. its exactly what i wanted. check out the photos. really impressed with this business and ill be back in the future! highly recommended.

after struggling to find a reliable dry cleaner that wont lose items, or write on the inside of your clothing as a means of identification, i finally came upon strong ii dry cleaners located downtown at grant and 3rd. this is a very new location and they are still working out some issues as far as getting their pos systems up and running using monthly invoices sent via email for the time being, but i really can not say enough about how excellent the customer service is, how friendly the employees are, and how great the quality of the dry cleaning is. let them know how you would like your items cleaned, alert them to any stains or spots you might think will be a problem, and your clothing will be well cleaned and well taken care of.if you work anywhere near here downtown, i highly recommend giving them a try.
strong ii dry cleaners provides excellent, quality service; its unmatched! i have taken several articles of clothing to them, all with outstanding results. white shirts are returned sparkling white and suit pants have a perfect crease have paid top  at other places to have a double, unsightly crease! their stain removal is amazing; i had 2 articles that i thought were ruined, but now they look brand new. their prices are comparable or less than other places ive gone, but if you pay in advance, you get a 10 discount! 3 different individuals have taken care of me at the grant street location; all a pleasure to deal with...so glad they opened downtown!  i know why they have been in business since 1930 :
great location and even better service while staying in downtown pittsburgh! i stay downtown pittsburgh on union usw business for weeks at a time and like anyone else, i need to have my clothes cleaned. i found strong ii online and it was just down grant street from the omni william penn hotel where we stay.  the employees at the store were first class and very helpful as well as very polite. i had four shirts that needed dry cleaned and pressed as well as about fifteen pounds of laundry which i needed washed and folded.  i dropped my clothes off on tuesday and they had it all done on thursday afternoon, they said if i needed it done sooner, they may be able to do that as well. they send all laundry off site to their main laundry plant. the clothes came back perfectly cleaned. the dry cleaned shirts looked great and the wash and fold service was better than my wife does and shes the best.  the cost was much cheaper then doing the wash and fold myself at a laundromat. dry cleaning cost was very reasonable as well.  ive recommended them to the group im working with and will use them again while in pittsburgh.  as a side note: i went home for the weekend and didnt bring home any laundry and the wife was very grateful ;
been using them for 2 weeks. very satisfied. the clerk has always been very friendly and the clothes have come out well. seems to be one of the few places downtown for dry cleaning.
the cafe is my new favourite in old port. stop by with a book, a friend, or a place to be and you can get a great espresso drink to stay or to go. they rotate the variety of their anchored beans often, which helps keep me coming back, and the owner really helps make the atmosphere friendly and comfortable. the flyjin espresso bar is about wellroasted beans and wellmade drinks. bring a friend and try an allonge or gibraltar if you like a wellbodied espresso.
a hidden gem if you ask me!tastefully decorated, as most places around the old port!  this little coffee shop offers a couple of confortable counter sits.  if you order to stay, you will get a what you order cutely presented on a small wooden tray.the barista is the friendliest, the coffee is delicious and the pastries are fresh and tasty! the soy latte is fantastic!what else can you ask for?
excellent food for an excellent price!! the baos were very flavorful.  my favourite was the fish and the pork belly baos. a must try, is the poutine with kimchi, and the fried oreo ice cream dessert!!! so delicious, you will come back for more!!!  thank you bao boys!!!!
a great place for a tasty snack!!!  i loved the new fusion poutine twist. the beef and pork belly bao was decadent. but the most amazing thing is sharing the deepfried oreo cookievanilla ice creamcaramel topping with the love of your life.
classic bao was the best id had in a long time! the kimchi poutine is brilliant. apparently they just got their liquor license last week before our visit, which is great because this is perfect drinking food. salmon bao also quite good. friendly service.
i am not very experienced with baos but i thought that the food was delicious. i got three different baos and loved them all, i especially recommend the korean bao.  also the service was excellent, the guys were super friendly and definitely made me want to go back.
wow  what an amazing and impressive experience it was to buy a car from beepi! we enjoyed viewing cars online and the pictures and reviews were extremely helpful.we bought a 2011 mercedes e350 and the cars condition exceeded our expectations, as did the communication and customer service throughout the process. there were a few challenges along the way, as beepi team realized the cruise control was not working right before the delivery day. they serviced the car and offered a loaner car until the repair was fixed. they also decided to put on new tires and a new windshield because they felt they were below beepis standards. very impressive!helen and michelle provided great service and outstanding communication throughout the entire process. justin, who delivered the car, was very knowledgeable, thorough and patient. beepi does an excellent job of hiring strong and professional people.i highly recommend beepi and cant imagine going to ever go to a car dealership to buy again. i will be buying another car from them in january!
beepi is revolutionizing the way we buy cars.  i cant say it enough to people.  the most important thing for us as consumers to know is what car you want.  what is that car and do not settle.  its this very information that dealerships twist and turn and so many of us time after time leave with the car the dealership wanted to sell you and not what you wanted and probably didnt realize or could believe you were possible of owning.  thats what beepi is changing.  they dont have fancy commercials, and sexy models, and most importantly they do not have dealerships.  they dont have monstrosities of buildings that feel intimidating as soon as you walk in them.  beepi also doesnt have salespeople, they just have people.  real people who respond in a flash day or night and help you without any agenda besides to help you get the car you want. i tell people i bought a car online and immediately minds close.  then i tell them my details  that they still took my trade in for more than anyone else would pay.  that they answered every question by email within 3 minutes and that i didnt even need gap insurance, because my car isnt worth more than i owe.  because they do not need to tag on all sorts of accessories fees to pay to upkeep a dealership.  when i begin to tell people my details, people start listening.  as justin said who delivered my car, the system is broken and beepi wants to help fix it.  i looked for over a year for the right car.  i was in no hurry to jump into car payments.  after having to let every dealerships and salesperson i had visited over that year that i finally found my deal, they knew a. they were in trouble b. consumers are not dumb, and c. one salesperson asked me for the website info so that he could apply.my car was everything they said and more.  from the first email to sitting in my kitchen signing documents was a total of 7 days, not business days, 7 days total.  in my kitchen, in the comfort of my home, just two people doing fair business.  that is what car should be...well maybe not always in my kitchen, but the point is this is real.i dont yelp and i dont review  most times i believe the business should know and do their homework to provide the best service as im not here to teach them as a consumer.  but this was different, this is a public service i feel i am doing.  for anyone that might read this, beepi is the only way to buy a car fairly in this day and age.  thank you beepi, you made me the person in charge of my car choice and deal!thanks again, stephanie wiersum https:beepi.zendesk.comattachmentstokenwgxaz0oxid11emqnex8mvmhkl?namestephpic.png
what an experience!!  fast, efficient and so easy to do business with.  surprised that it was only 6 days to deliver from washington state.  ruiz, the delivery specialist, walked me through the inspection report, they call it a dimple map.  very, very minor items.  some you cant even see.  the car looks new.  i was nervous buying an undriven car from a true internet dealer, but i would do this again in a heartbeat.  thank you beepi team!
never thought i would be hooked on a group workout program. all four trainers jen, ryan, quincy and brooke are all motivating and have all pushed me to give it my all. i leave every work out sweaty, feeling great and accomplished. the front desk staff are all helpful and friendly. id highly recommend otf downtown!
founding member of this location and first time orangetheory fitness enthusiast. i am so glad this finally opened near me downtown because i have wanting to try it for years. i left a near pointless gym membership for this workout. now i am hooked. all four trainers do challenging yet motivating classes and their energy is infectious. they push you to do your best, fix your form, and offer modifications but dont force you to do more than you can. i like that they offer free trial classes because ive been able to share this workout with a handful of friends. my fiance was convinced and signed up for a membership, too. do your free first class and see for yourself if this is the workout for you!
im hooked on the workouts!  the trainers are very good at motivating and challenging you.   its amazing how they make an hour of grueling workout seem like fun.  dont get me wrong, you will be uncomfortable and tired during the workout but you will feel great afterwards.  let them know if you have any injuries and they will show you modifications to the exercises.  i used to hate running and burpees.  in less than 2 months, otf has turned me into a runner and i cant get enough burpees.  i also have more energy and have been able to stick to a healthful way of eating.  i highly recommend that you sign up for the free trial classes to understand what im raving about.
obsessed. i have honestly never been dedicated to my fitness and diet. i always looked for that quick fix. well, theres no short cut. otf has such an incredible program that keeps me motivated and has truly transformed my lifestyle! the trainers are incredible, jen and brooke are always inspirational in everything they say and always have helpful tips for diet  nutrition. ryans energy is downright infectious! long story short, i couldnt imagine my life without otf
im in love with orange theory.  i have been going since this location opened.  id heard about the workout through the radio for a couple of years, but i always thought it would be too expensive or too hard of a workout.  let me just say first, i used to hate working out.  i was one of those people who would actually get depressed when i went to a gym.  orange theory changed my attitude about working out!  i think the main reason why i would get depressed about exercise before this that i didnt know what i was doing on the machines.  and since my workouts were not effective i rarely saw results the results that i thought i should see.  so when i joined orange theory i was skeptical, but hopeful.i started off with the classes a month package, but i found myself actually want to go more often than!  so i signed up for the unlimited classes package and it was the best investment ive made this year.  the classes are fun because you dont do the same thing for too long of a timeframe.  also, the instructors ryan, fuego, brooke and colton turn on the beast mode in all of us with their energy.all of the staff make the experience great.  they know all of our names and great is when we walk in.  i highly recommend orange theory to everyone!
its great to come to visit family  and able to come and work out with our otf from phoenix. great work out with trainer ryan. love the run and row work out but the best part was the cool down. thanks for the push and introducing your self. will sure come back to this location when i come back and visit again. see you soon. otf
nouveau petit cafe independant adjacent au stationnement autoparc stanley sur la rue stanley entre stecatherine  renelevesque, petit frere du melk sur monkland dans n.d.g. enfin, un petit cafe sympa dans ce coin du centreville qui sert du bon cafe. clientele daffaires en quete de cafeine.  ils servent du cafe 49th parallel. expresso de qualite 3,25. ils ont seulement des viennoiseries muffins  biscuits, mais nont pas de sandwichs, a venir, selon la barista. deco, simple  moderne. a savoir, pas de wifi  pas de toilettes.55 visite en juin 2015.
best latte i have ever had! holy smokes!!! how can something i order all the time taste so much better here?!?plus they started off my day with classic dmx b^h get out the way lol!!!definitely stop by!!!
so i was staying at the sheraton around the corner and went around town every morning to find a new and amazing breakfast place. thankfully, i finally decided to come by on my last day and i had only wish i had come here earlier.i ordered a chai latte... oh i still miss you so much. i hate it when i get a chai latte that doesnt have that chai kick to it, this chai latte had the right amount of kick and hit the right spot. ive tried many chai lattes in the last three years in various places with very few that are good, but this one was great!if you dont drink teacoffee, you still need to stop here to try the scones. there is no clotted cream and no it is not warm and toasty when you get it, but they must make the best cheddar scones ever. i will definitely come back in the future to try all their scones! im beating myself up for forgetting my phone that morning and consuming everything before i could get back to it.
went in with an indie coffee passport my lady gave me.solid coffee drink, nice and comfortable decor, all great.  a nice find in otherwise depressing and to commercial area part of montreal.
discovered this tiny little cafe next to my hotel and it was love at first sip!  the branding, the menu and the atmosphere are all very appealing, and the vanilla latte was likely one of the best ive ever had.  i went back the same afternoon for a pickme up during what was a long work day, and the barista suggested adding a homemade marshmallow to my latte... it was like icing on the cake!  if i come back to montreal, ill be sure to check out the original melk, as it sounds like its even better...
compared to my previous skin doc hands over fist 100 to 1 better treatment !!! thank you guyz very much for a great experience and your hard work. i highly recommend this place!
i love this place! always very welcoming and comforting as well. i am always seen very quickly by the doctors and they have been extremely helpful! thank you!
i couldnt have been more impressed with this office. jimmy nghia trung tran, mpas, pac was not only friendly, knowledgeable, and thorough, but ive never had a less painful set of biopsies performed. i will definitely be recommending this practice to friends and family.
i dont know what those other reviewers are talking about. i had the wings and they were great.  i dont do hot so i had the teriyaki sesame wings. my husband did get the hot wings and he said they were some of the best he ever had. their spring roll is quite yummy as are the sweet potato tots.  this place is definitely worth a try.
just finished an order of buffalo wings and these are by far the best wings ive had in vegas. i thought about ordering the suicidal sauce, but chickened out and decided to go with the hot sauce instead. wings were delicious and the staff was amazing. definitely found my goto wing stop here in vegas.
amazing wings.  they are big and crispy on the outside...juicy on the inside.  love the sauce and its just the right amount, not swimming in it like some other places.  check out their salads too!  9.00 for a chopped chicken salad is a great deal.  i just love this place.
being natives of buffalo, we had high hopes for anchor bar when we saw it as an option at the food court in the venetian. we talked to a couple employees while we were there and they said they are committed to staying true to the original restaurant quality. they said they get all of the sauce directly from buffalo! we went two days in a row and got the wings both medium and hot and beef on weck delicious we asked for the wings extra crispy both times and i would recommend that to anyone they were the perfect level of crispiness. we were very happy with our experience!
i was thrilled when my wife told me she saw the anchor bar while she was wandering  around the venetian. i couldnt wait to try it  i was not disappointed. i ordered a double order of hot wings  my wife got the anchor strips  fries. my wings were large  perfectly cooked. crispy on the outside  juicy on the inside. my wife enjoyed her anchor strips  the fries were great as well. perfectly seasoned  crispy. the only criticisms i could have was i was not a huge fan of the blue cheese and i wish the wings had a little more sauce on them. i tend to like more sauce so that is just a personal preference. i would just ask for extra sauce next time.
ordered a chopped chicken salad and the chicken cheese steak combo. maddelynn was very nice. food was very very good. fries were great. very reasonably priced.
i love hot wings.  one could say im a hot wings addict.  ive got way out of my way to sample the best of the best hot wings literally around the world. so when i say these hot wings rank among the best ive had you should pay attention.  a bit on the high price side these wings are worth those extra dollars.  izzy, our bartender was awesome.  he made our drinks to protection.
good wings! tried the hot and lemon pepper wings. located at the venetian hotel food court, which is where we were staying and right by our elevator. staff was friendly.
these chicken wings are the size of your big toe with a lot of chicken very tasty and they use a clean oil so the chicken taste fresh. they make their blue cheese fresh. it tastes so good better than ranch. however the ranch is a close second because that is also made fresh on site. the prices are high but thats because its the strip. even though the prices are high is worth the money. i cannot wait to try some of the other menu items. as a local i definitely  recommend it to locals and tourists alike. the worst part about this place is the wait. because you get hungry and your mouth starts watering. and all you want is a giant chicken wing in your mouth besides your big toe.
we were walking looking for something good to eat we figured lets try something new. our first time here my first time in vegas the guys there friday night were great we had such a great time very helpful honestly by far best service ever!!! great food, drinks  company! selfie with chicken hat is a must haha
im a wing connoisseur and i enjoying venturing out to get wings wherever i am...so why not while in vegas? just a walk down from our awesome hotel see my review on the palazzo, this place is located within the food court at the venetian. its a nice stroll walking through the grand canal shoppes and then entering a familiar malltype food court...but dont let the simple atmosphere fool you.me and some friends came here around 4pm with no wait. we ordered 50 wings with 6 different flavors the 5 unique flavors and 1 hot flavor and the order only took about 20 minutes to make very impressive! the wings were just so. freaking. delicious. such yummy batter, great flavors, and large wing size... how i wish i was back in vegas to eat these right now!! i would also like to add that the service was great and the employees were friendly.do yourself a favor and make a stop here while youre in sin city.
as a lover of wings, i had to pay a visit to the place that created the original buffalo wing.they are located in the food court of the grand canal shoppes inside the venetian.  they only have bar seating, but there are other tables around the food court.when you first sit at the bar, theres a contraption on the countertop infusing bourbon with mint. they use it in their southern comfort drink which is pretty good, and this is coming from someone who doesnt drink bourbon.  their pineapple express 16 oz 9 is a rum based drink that was more my style. it tasted like pineapple soda.for a snack, i got a single order of wings and it was enough to share between two people.  a single order 12 comes with 9 wings and you get a choice of two flavors.  i went with lemon pepper and mild buffalo.  both were tasty.  the lemon pepper is a tangy zesty dry rub.  the mild sauce had enough heat to tingle my tongue but i could still enjoy the flavor.  these were some of the best wings ive had.  they were meatier than your average wing and the flavors were on point.  the only problem is that there isnt a location closer to where i live.
great wings and fries. will come back and tell friends and coworkers who come through. staff was awesome too
got fried wings well seasoned with casino pricing. very good, tasted home made.  will return and try other things
yes  these truly are the best hot wings you will ever have. so good that the rest of your vegas trip, you will be finding ways to get back and have more. great friendly staff too!
creators of the original chicken buffalo wings! similar quality to the original location in buffalo, new york. this is a musttry for wings lovers.
this is the place! hands down the best wings we have ever wrapped our mouths around! we feasted on a mixed combo of hot and med wings that came with the traditional blue cheese dip and celery stalks. the wings were perfectly cooked.. crispy on the outside ,moist and drop off the bone tender inside. we also had the beef on a weck sandwich that was great and the buffalo spring roll. i believe that anything on their menu will be wonderful. good selection of beers.. my fav anchor steam and brooklyn brown ale the perfect brews to wash it all down with are on tap. we will definitely be back whenever in vegas! oh and the staff...they are so much fun and entertaining. great place!!
i have been looking for a photo montage video maker. i had a couple of videos made by some companies and i was not really happy. i am glad i found creative artistry of arizona. they made an excellent memorial photo montage video of my mother.  creative artistry was able to capture my moms lifetime story in a captivating way that everyone  enjoyed watching it. the staff is very helpful when i didnt know where to begin.  they have competitive pricing.  will definitely hire them again. thank you creative artistry. you are the best!
i just had a second video created by creative artistry and it exceeded my expectations yet again.  luz, the talent behind creative artistry, was such a pleasure to work with  very professional, yet so conscientious of the tone and feeling i wanted each video to convey.  you could tell she really cares about making each video just what you envision.  she communicated with me throughout the process and worked with me to find just the right music to go with each montage.  so versatile too, each video had a totally different feel from the other; the first captured the fun and whimsy of my bridal shower, the second evoked the serene joy and elegance of my wedding.  the videos themselves flowed beautifully, transitioning smoothly with the music.  i was particularly impressed with the small details, like the use of a lovely confetti transition as the photo of our walk up the aisle as husband and wife came into view. if youre looking for a beautiful and creative way to showcase your photographs from a special occasion, or to commemorate someone special in your life, i highly recommend using creative artistry!
creative artistry is such a high quality company. the professionalism they offer, from start to finish, is above anything else you will find with another company. creative artistry took the photos from my dads life and created a beautiful video set to one of my dads favorite songs. we showed the video at his memorial service. friends and family were touched and impressed by the work. i love that i can pull the video out and watch it whenever im missing my dad the most or when my kids ask to see grandpa. its priceless to have these photos all condensed together set to music that reminds me of my dad. choose creative artistryyou wont be disappointed! grace
last minute showing of a house and needed the pool cleaned. i called md pools last night after hours not only did he answer he was out at 7am to fix the creeper and clean the pool. professional, on time and excellent price! i will refer this place. you never know what you will get with a pool service company but i will definitely put this one at the top of my list!!
absolutely amazing!  professional and proficient!!!  i couldnt ask for more!  my pool looks wonderful!  thank you so much!
very professional. always reliable. does a fantastic job! my pool never looked better.  recommended to all my friends and clients!!
it took me 23 years and countless pool technicians to find the right one. there are many to choose from and ive tried quite a few. in my opinion, michael at md pools has both the knowledge and responsiveness that you need to keep your pool and equipment looking and running great. michael is always willing to help out. md pools is very honest and competitive, which i have found not to be the norm in the pool business. michael takes the time to make sure that you understand the whys behind all of his cleaning and repairs. i am extremely satisfied with all of the repairs, cleaning and pool care advice that michael has given me. jeff scottsdale
i attended wren houses soft opening last night and im stoked to have this place open in the neighborhood.  it has a real local feel to it  nothing like the more corporate microbreweries that have popped up.  the two beers i had were great, but i highly recommend the ipa.  i will be returning to try the rest.
ive been watching this location for 4 or 5 months now. im so happy it opened!! the beers are all good and the location has potential!! i think many people will want to come here to tilt a few after dinner or as a standalone destination unto itself. so nice to have another quality local brewer in az!
this is a cool little place. people were great, the interior is simple, and the beer was really good. im a stout man myself so i went for the jomax oatmeal stout. delicious and smooth! their black caddis isnt too shabby either. it did get a little muggy with so many people in there but not a big deal for me at least. i initially went to go get some loca popa but im glad i grabbed a beer and socialized for a little while. i can definitely see myself heading back for a beer or two. :
really chill local brewery that actually feels local. seating is limited so get here early on a weekend if you want a stool. no patio yet, but they told me itll be ready around september. they had four beers on tap opening weekend porter, ipa, ginger pale ale, and coffee oatmeal stout. everything they make is great and they got an imperial porter, vienna lager, and honey wheat beer in the works so youll find something to please pretty much all of your friends. theyre even experimenting with growing their own hops because theyre just so hardcore local. no food. theres tons of tasty taquerias around the neighborhood though, making it a great place to meet up for a few brews before heading for food.
i went to the soft opening last week and its a very charming place. i recommend the pale ale, very tasty. looking forward to my next visit to the wren house!
really cool new spot close to downtown.  this is a great spot to start a night or to get a beer and have a conversation.  their brew master comes from a pretty well known brewery up north and he brings a lot of good experience.  anyways  friendly people, good beer, and a perfect neighborhood bar.
great beer and even better atmosphere.  evolving lineup of inventive beers and friendly staff.  feels like home!
i was in phoenix this weekend visiting my husbands family and my brotherinlaw took us to wren house to get some beers because it was hot as blls and we had already hit up the mall. i am not a huge beer drinker and some of my favorite brews include bud light lime and coronas with lime. so we got to wren house and they didnt have limey beers or limes i ordered the ginger pale ale. i like ginger beer so i was like i will probably like this ginger flavored beer. and i did. it was quite fantastic. i dont know how to describe beers using proper jargon so ill leave it at fantastic. the guys who opened the place were there and chatted with us while we were at the bar. i always love connecting with small business owners and hearing their stories. these guys are truly passionate about beer and i was happy to support their dream. we visit phoenix often never again in june and i will definitely be back for another ginger pale ale!
great beer  awesome local feel. exactly what this area needed. they sometimes have food trucks.
this is a great local brewery! finding a place that hits on the beer and the atmosphere is tough, but these guys did it. the visual appeal of the inside is very nice. they did a great job with the way its set up. and then the beers. obviously thats what you go to a brewery for. and their first set of beers were all very different, and all very good. i cant wait until they keep coming out with new ones. ill be sure to go back here often. its definitely worth it! make sure you put this place on your list of places to try. itll probably become one of your goto hangout spots!
what an adorable spot! we have been waiting for them to open and got to hop in for a taste before heading to dinner. we really enjoyed the ipa and the ginger beer was surprisingly refreshing. we like the communal table. the bungalow has a sweet feel to it. parking is just a little tricky.
this is a great new place to come and check out.  the beers are awesome and the bartenders are great.  they have water and pretzels available and a food truck right out side of you get hungry!
finally got to try this place out! with it being so close, its perfect to bike to and i love how they have a bike map! :dthese are the beers i tried: senor gallo abv of 5.1  for those of you who like lighter lagers, this is for you!  jolene ginger pale ale abv of 4.5  different, but i liked it. super gingery, so if youre not a fan of ginger, dont try this.  jomax abv of 6.9  coffee wheat stout.. yum!! loved it. got a whole growler to take home! wren house ipa abv of 6.8  yay for hops! not too hoppy, just right. nice and refreshing. cant wait to take home a growler of this bad boy!heard they have food trucks that come around 4pm. looking forward to going back to fill up my growler and getting closer to my 1 fill up! fill up a growler 9 times and get the 10th fill for a 1! who doesnt like beer rewards?
the best beer in az! friendly service and good grub on the side with regular food trucks!
oh phoenix, more of this, please! centrally located, rustic interior, big bar, bigger table, lots of natural light, not too loud, and really good beer! we got a flight and tried everything they had on tap. i really liked the senor gallo lager and the oatmeal stout, but they were all fantastic. they dont serve food but there was a food truck there when we visited, so we got dinner and ate at the brew house. its a great spot for a little date, especially if you can snag the two leather recliners in the back by the fireplace.
ive been waiting for this place to open for a long time!! i live pretty close to here and now need to fashion some sort of growler carrier to my bike. all of the beers that i have tried have been pretty decent. some are obviously better than others and i cant wait to see new brews that they come up with. no food here, so byof.
wren house is a welcome addition to the growing cenpho beer scene. having just moved back to phx from the east valley where breweries like arizona wilderness had me spoiled on crafty goodness, i am super excited to see a quality brewery open up so close to home. ive been in a few times now and continue to be impressed with everything. with most new breweries, ive come to expect that their initial offerings arent the best  normally takes some time to get used to the new brewersystem and work out the kinks. but, this is not the case at wren house. everything is delightful here, and i tried everything from the ipa to the stout to the lager. even if its not my favorite style, i respect that theyre doing each style justice. the decor is also super cute  a nice old building with a community vibe going on. i like that there are no tvs, forces us to be friendly and talk to each other! ive had the opportunity to meet several other beer fans while sitting at the bar there, the customers are all very cool, passionate but laid back. the staff, especially brad, are amazing there as well  he remembers your name and your order and really takes the time to greet and connect with the customers. check this place out  swing by for a growler fill or stay and have a few brews. theyre active on social media and let you know their hours and beer lineup daily, so you can stay in the know. cheers!
this place is great. set in a cozy revitalized house, the inside is very simplistic but welcoming. the two bartenders were super friendly and helpful with the beer selection, offering us tastes of any of the beers. the place boasts a nice cheers vibe. will definitely return.
a great new addition to the growing brewery scene in phoenix.  this is small place. a tasting room.  the beer is fantastic and the service is friendly and knowledgeable.  we got flights so we could taste all seven of the beers.   theres a beer for every taste.   im partial to ipas and the wren house and the bolo tie rye both are delicious. my friend enjoys stouts and the black caddis, a dark porter, scores very high with her.  please try out this great new local brewery!
feels like a hidden little secret.  dont really want to post about it since it wont be a secret anymore!  the bartender aka, beertender nora sp makes you feel at home.  since the brewery is actually an old home the vibe comes together perfectly.  i live in the east valley, but the beer is worth the drive.  the rye ipa, great, the stout with a floater of press coffee is to die for.  tastes like ice coffee, but 10x better.  my wife and i were out near the biltmore for a date, and this stop was a terrific night cap.
im surprised by how good the beer is here! i just moved down the street and i was excited that the beer is amazing! i have to been quite a few breweries with an amazing ambiance but the beer is kinda ehhh. this place is very simple. its a nice atmosphere but the beer is so fucking good! chocolate and oatmeal stouts! yummm get in my tum!
great staff. the beer is solid, and usually there are some interesting offerings. taps rotate and cold brew coffee on tap for glasses, adding to your beer, or for growler fills to go. there are board games to use and play, trivia night on tuesdays, and cask beers depending on when you go. highly recommended. they do have some paninis available  the sandwiches are premade by noble bread co down the street and feature bread made from the spent grain. they dont last long typically and are first come basis, but you can bring in your own food as well.
brad the bartender is awesome!!! he works the bar as a pro and never lets a glass go empty! love this place!
tres delicieux la fameuse gaufre belge, absolument a essayer. beaucoup de choix de gaufres, crepes, cafes, espresso, cappuccino et plein dautres choses. endroit tres propre et le service tres courtois. chaque plat est tres bien decore avec minutieux. je vous le conseille fortement.
finally, a reputable taxi service!  the lack of livery oversight in this city has amazed me, until today i had never taken a cab where the fares were clearly posted, along with the drivers name and badge number.  most of the cabs ive taken are totally unscrupulous, add phantom charges to the meter, take ridiculous routes to jack up prices, the whole bit.i called sunrise for a ride to the airport, the cab came in 10 minutes, the dispatcher called me in my apartment to let me know the cab was waiting outside.  sure, the car itself was from 1982, but i love the old school charm, reminds me of my first car.  the driver was unbelievably nice and friendly.  fares were clearly posted and the short ride to the airport was 10 and not the 15 or 20 ive somehow had charged to me from other companies.  i wont be using discount cab or any of the other dreadful cab companies ever again.
not closed
if your looking for some flashy cab ride somewhere, than go elsewhere.  if you are drunk bar hopping, than sunrise is the cab service for you.  from my bikini to my house, with companies like discount, i was paying 13, with sunrise, its never more than 9.  mix that in with having them take you to other bars in the area, and the difference adds up for sure.  the cabs are sweet 70s80s domestics reeking of cigarette smoke, and the cab drivers have all been hilarious and good spirits.  perfect ride for a cheap night on the town!
if youre looking to go out, get smashed, waste all your money at the bar and have only a few bucks to get home then sunrise cab is for you. the fares are ridiculously cheap and that has made be a loyal customer for ever more.
sunrise cab has been my taxi service of choice for nearly three years.  they are not out of business.  i live in central phoenix and regularly used them as a bus alternative while working for state of az.  dispatcher always gave me followup call to notify me that cab was about to arrive at my home, drivers were consistently punctual, wellmannered and safety conscious. i dont mind getting a ride in a 1982 chevy, particularly when the fare is 3050 less than competitor taxi services.  also, the fleet seems to be getting some newer vehicles, and the ac and heat always worked in even the oldest taxis. although sunrise seems to be in downtown phoenix mostly, i have taken them to sky harbor and even out to a lastminute interview up in north scottsdale.  driver knew her way around, had no trouble finding the new american express offices and getting me there on time!
the 5star rating on the cab company is legit.  im always skeptical a cab company can be that good, but these guys deliver.  i called them a few days ago  i needed to be at the airport within 20 minutes of the call, and i live 15 minutes away.  these guys jumped into gear and delivered a taxi despite what i know was a challenging request for them.  they did everything right called 1 min before arrival, driver knocked my front door, waited patiently a few minutes while i gathered my baggage and was courteous the whole way.  exactly what a cab company should be.
 you discount crab. i have been a loyal customer to sunrise cab for about 5 years now and they have never let me down. sometimes i wish they would get there a little more quicker but they will always give you a call when they are on their way and help you out with any bags you might have. i was giving 4050 bucks to discount cab every other week until i learned about sunrise. so my bill went from 4050 bucks down to 30 bucks or sometime under. the drivers never give you an attitude if you want them to drive you your way unlike the drivers for discount. one driver i had from discount cab went the long way one time purposely to make more money because i did not know the directions exactly. well i made sure that did not happen again and had i directions the next time and did not use them anymore. a lot of drivers i talked to either used to work for discount or came from a big city. some of the cars can be old, like 1980s old but they are getting new cars, the fleet they have now used to be police cars. bud is always great when i call him although he can curt sometimes but thats just his way. he always helped me when i was in some tight spots before. they only service phoenixmostly the metro area but they will come pick you up if they are driving you out to chandler or to some other boonie location. just let them know ahead of time that way you can save some money on your return trip. they will drive you out far from phoenix because that is worthwhile for them to make the trip.
this weekend was the first time i used sunrise cab and they were excellent both times!  yes, the cars are older.  but!  the fares are cheaper, drivers are nice, very efficient, arrived on time, and called a minute before the pickup.  i am pleased with the experience and i will definitely use them next time!note: they only take cash, but they dont mind stopping at an atm.
i could care less if they are chain smoking peeps in an old retired police car... heres the deal: i used them for years when i lived in downtown phoenix. i could beebop anywhere for dirt cheap, always on time. and i never waited for too long. these guys rock. i now live in chandler. i have to go to an event saturday night downtown. i call sunrise and  say, hey can i get one of your dudes to take me home to chandler and if so, how much? they do not usually travel around chandler. the answer??? yes! of course! the cost: 36!!! are you kidding me??? these people rock. highly recommend.  far from fancy dancy. but def worth their weight in gold.
first off people, this is a ghetto cab service inaround downtown phoenix its your own fault if you dont know that. if you call them from chandler, scottsdale, or elsewhere far because you are too cheap to pay for discountyellowclean air the cabs that have 300 cars on the road, not 7 then dont complain. this is sunrise, not a limo service. theres a reason why they will get you somewhere for 12 of what discount charges. when i lived in the biltmore area i used these guys almost exclusively. the dispatcher recognized my number and had almost memorized my routine and knew where i was going at what time on any given day almost. yes the cars are dirty, i dont really care since im in a cab for maybe 15 minutes at most. yes the drivers might look a little iffy, get them talking and you can have some of the most interesting conversations and hear some very funny stories.
my first ever cab ride and it was an experience!  a good one with a few laughs.  called for a cost estimate and it was a great fare.  we werent easy to find but driver communicated regularly with us until he found us. he was on time.  car was old but was relatively clean and made me feel like i went back in time. driver made sure to get us to our destination as quickly as possible talked about where he was going and what our route options were. he was entertaining to talk to had lots to say and had a great life story. actual fare matched the estimate!  totally worth the price and probably worth even more if the cars were newer!
theres a oil commercial where the guy retires an old cop car , tags it as a taxi, and says its ready for another 200k miles,  well these cabs look like theyve done 3x that,  but they deliver and cheaply at that;  aesthetics take a back seat to great customer service at reasonable rates.when i called for a pickup at the west side of town, the dispatcher said it would be about 2025 since he didnt have anyone in the area. sure enough,   i get a courtesy call from the driver who says hes around the corner 20 minutes later. my driver, oz who of course will be herein dubbed ozzy in homage to the great bathead eater,  was an awesome conversationalist who made time fly, and even stopped by the bank for me so i could deposit a check. before you know it,  i reached my destination.i saved these guys phone number in case i ever get a few too many at a bar, i can call them ,  pass out and drooldont go ewww , you know you do it too on the back seat and know that i will get home safetly.a
i wanted to check out this brand new ultra lounge. i went there on monday and tuesday night. i went there at 10 oclock on monday which they just opened. very chill on mondays i guess but good music!!i went back there the next day which was tuesday.it was really busy..lot of people, loved the rappers, live music and very good vibe!! drinks are affordable prices and one another thing about this place is you can get sushimunch with your drinks if you are hungry!i like this place alot..very fun but casual so if you want to party but dont wanna go to strip then you should go there to have fun for good price!
the music spinning by a live deejay on saturday nite was talented and charming. i was in town to visit family and had a great time. drinks were fast and delish with a heavy hand pouring. the bartender was friendly and charming. best part is i left my credit card and id behind on the way to another bar and when we went this morning to see if the business was open it was not but employees opened the doors and gave my property back to me all within an hour. huge thumbs up! thank you for the fun nite and excellent service.
finally i had the chance to check this place out. what a treasure in the heart of chinatown. you would never spot this place from driving around. it really is from word of mouth, quite exclusive from the public eye. once you find this place, it looks closed.. again, think exclusive. dont be intimidated to open the door, youll feel like youre at a house party without the stress of finding a spot to throw it at. ive been putting off of coming here for some time due to work and life events, but once i did stop by ive been coming back every week since! the owners are welcoming, kind, and extremely accommodating. thank you for everything. hospitality at its best! one of the reasons why i love coming here. great vibe, spacious venue, music... the music is heartfelt. soul driven.. nobody needs to tell you to get up and dance you just pop up and do it. this place makes you feel at home. an undeniable comfort for music lovers. there are not many places where you can truly appreciate the culture that the owners of this ultra lounge brings.this ultra lounge emphasizes more strongly on the different hip hop genres versus the infamous club music of trance and house music, which all of vegas nightclubs are all about. im more about the hip hop hooray than the acid beats of what in the heck is this?! if you like some general knowledge of what hip hop is... this is from the global awareness through hip hop culture program: hip hop is the constantly evolving spirit and consciousness of urban youth that keeps recreating itself in a neverending cycle. it is joy, sorrow, pleasure, pain, victory, defeat, anger, happiness, confusion, clarity, humor, intensity, dream, nightmare, life, death, and everything else in between. it is the spirit that connects the past to the present and lays a path towards the future.there are live performances from some amazing, talented artists on particular nights. sometimes on wednesday or thursday nights, they even have special limited food menu from creative chefs from the food network shows. my favorite is friday nights, which is riddim in the red. a mixture of reggae, dancehall, and jawaiian. the energy here is intoxicating. the drink specials is a wonderful reason to replenish frequently ; if youre hungry, they do provide a delicious food menu to go with your quench of thirst. the staff, itself is a dedicated team. all smiles and ready for the night. any spills, empty beer bottles, finished dishes, you name it.. they are on it like flies on.. on.. well you know!? quite attentive to guests needs and they know how to keep this place lookin fresh and so clean. love our server nick though. his enthusiasm and funloving attitude makes you just beam with good spirits :d he brought over some tequila shots and i told my friend as soon as nick turned around.. drink it for me hurry!!! then nick turned out and said... i saw that! o.o my stunned face was priceless.. i told my friend.. omg he has eyes on his butt or what?! how did he know?!! :p love you, nick.ideal place for birthday celebrations and holiday get togethers! or just to unwind after a long week or night at work.love the fact that you cant smoke inside. deal breaker :p djs always spinning the greatest hits. i once danced for three hours straight here. the music was too good to sit down. my thighs and ribs paid a hefty price for it and took a week to recover. reggae can have that effect on you. the dance floor can be wherever you are standing. although, there is an open space near the dj booth, if you like to dance with the crowd. seating wise, there are 6.. 3 individual sized tables with 2 leather booths side by side for large parties, 2 long tables with bench seating on each side in the middle, and 2 small tables in the middle with a big enough leather seat that can fit around 4 people. you can also have a seat at the bar, which has 4 stools. the volume of the music is loud enough to enjoy listening to, but also you can have a decent conversation without having to yell in each others ear! i thought that was brilliant in their way in making it a place to drink, dine, talk, and dance. a marvelous combination that speaks for itself. and for me, that speaks volumes in the value and admiration of what they offer here. i have a tremendous amount of love and respect for this place. it takes so much out of me to get out of the house, because my home is my serenity. but this ultra lounge is an exception. this feel good music venue is something you cant get enough of and is a one of a kind addition to our community. i love supporting local businesses and this one is definitely on the top of my favorite list!
new and super hip bar lounge. they always have something different going on. from live bands to decadent dishes. many dancers come here to hang and just express themselves on the dance floor. love coming here with friends and it is also a great place to celebrate birthdays as it is really cool and spacious.
a great new spot if you like good music and great drinks,  this is the new spot in chinatown!!
chill vibes. the music selection is nostalgically correct. i havent tried the food yet, that will be next.
super tasty food! very nice ambiance with good service. i had the scallops that were seared to perfection paired it with a nice sauvignon blanc that the waiter recommended.
amazing!! not only did we get service that was spot on and quick but she cared enough to give us background on how much time and effort is put into our food!we went during the soft opening and ordered the oscar 7oz beef tenderloin with crab meat and bearnaise, you get to choose two sides not including the asparagus already added and i went with creamed spinach and lobster mac. im going to do this breakdown per item.... the tenderloin we ordered to be cooked medium the way im told the chef feels its best served it was really super! so tender, flavorful and cooked just right. there wasnt too much or too little bearnaise and it paired nicely together. the creamed spinach i really enjoyed. some places really take the cream to another level and it makes the spinach taste artificial. this one was fresh and the way i prefer creamed spinach executed. the asparagus was also tasty... sea salt, cracked pepper and olive oil. perfect!the lobster mac..... highly recommended!!there was no skimping on the lobster and i found huge chunks scattered throughout. not only was the mac really good on its own but you could taste that the lobster had been cooked separately and was flavored on its own before being added. it really gave the dish the extra pizazz necessary for it to be the stand out for me. it was definitely the star!i should also mention, the bread they serve you before your meal was awesome as well. reminded me a little of the sweet hawaiian roles but bigger and with salt and pepper on top. overall..... i hope this place will be here for a very long time. its nice to have a steakhouse in the centennial area.....even nicer that this steakhouse serves happy hour daily with half off drink specials. how can i beat coming for a 3.50 moscow mule?!?!
welcome to the neighborhood fire rock! the food is amazing and the atmosphere is wonderful! hortencia was our server and she is very passionate about what she does! looking forward to many more visits with the family!
got invited for their preopen tasting. the restaurant is beautiful.  the service was great and amanda, our server was very attentive. and the food was perfect! we started with the philly cheese steak eggrolls, caesar salad and the cajun ribeye. everything tasted delicious.  look forward to going again after their opening.
we came in tonight and the service throughout the restaurant was excellent. my husband had the rack of lamb and when i asked him to describe it he said awesome. i had the bacon wrapped filet, which was great. i didnt need a1 sauce so you know it is good! our sever was canary and she was pleasant, and helpful. she was also polite and smiled throughout the time. you can tell she enjoys her job. the shrimp strawberry salad was my favorite. we will come back, this was a great spot! if you do happen to run into any issues be sure to ask for monica she will immediately resolve any problems.
great food! our group had ahi tuna, crab cakes, firecracker shrimp and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers . all were absolutely delicious with the exception of the crab cakes which were good but not the wow factor of the others. as far as salads the beet salad and the grilled shrimp  with strawberry salad were amazing. when it came to the entrees we tried the shrimp wrapped fillet which was great. also ordered the scallops which in my opinion was the best thing we had, even though every dish was a hit with us. we also had the lamb rack, mahi piccata and mahi mueniere which were all excellent. we definitely will be returning.
excellent food, beautiful restaurant. steak was so tender...yum. rita was marvelous server! we will be regulars!
i am a steak and seafood guy! with so many amazing things on the menu it was difficult to decide. everything from the appetizers down to the meal! i will be a regular! staff was amazing to top it off!
food was soo delicious!  service was outstanding and the prices were decent.  hard to find a place like this with a wide variety menu, yet still high quality of food and service, with decent prices. i cant wait for our next meal here!
this place is awesome! just opened on sunday and for a brand new restaurant that is bound to go through some growing pains it is doing things right. had the calamari fritti as an app. omg! talk about flavor! large slices of calamari perfectly breaded and golden with an amazing smoky and lightly spicy aioli on the side. mouth watering is an understatement. hubby had the chicken dijonnaisse and couldnt stop raving. a beautiful presentation with an incredible aroma. i had the lamb chops with a side of asparagus. both were perfectly seasoned and cooked to the perfect temperature. i am a bit of an etiquette snob, so when you see me picking apart bones with my fingers to get the last bite you know im serious. all of this paired with a delicious meritage  a sauvignon blanc for my honey. great treatment from our server sebastian, attentive, full of warmth and quick. amazing wine selection! sorely needed on this side of town. i am a forever fan, this is definitely going to be our go to place. excited to see its continued growth. thank you firerock!
wonderful neighborhood restaurant!  tonight we came out with a friend and we had a very delicious meal choicesphilly cheesesteak egg rollsshaved prime rib seared with onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, and cheddar cheese in a crispy egg roll.  served with an a1 aioli.   baked potato soup this house favorite is finished with our threecheese blend, bacon and scallions. caesar saladchopped romaine lettuce, tossed in our housemade caesar dressing, served with parmesan cheese and croutons dinner saladmixed greens with bacon, diced tomato, diced cucumber, carrots, diced egg, croutons, and cheddar jack cheese.  served with choice of dressing      filet oscarbeef tenderloin, topped with crabmeat, fresh steamed asparagus and drizzled with homemade bearnaise7 oz. cajunspiced ribeyechoice ribeye handcut and marinated in cajun spices, glazed with a creole butter mahi mahi was delicious!
had a great dinner with my family and friend. the steak kabobs were delicious! my kids enjoyed the burgers. family friendly atmosphere. cant wait to return! thanks for the awesome service, angelia!
calamari the best, beer can chicken phenomenal, pork tenderloin other great dish of many of they menu great  service, miss monica the general manager very attentive and professional.wonderful dinning experience.
had the filet oscar..my wife had the chicken dijonaise... both exceptional.... fun atmosphere... wait staff was great... good prices!!!....
this place is awesome!  we were referred by a friend and decided to check it out.  there were 6 of us total and we ordered a variety of appetizers, drinks, and meals.  each of us were extremely satisfied as it seems everything on the menu is delicious!  the staff and manager were fantastic as was the ambiance.  we are definitely looking forward to coming back!
4.5 starswe had great food and great service from jess. probably one of the better restaurants in the nw. we tried it for lunch before venturing out for dinner. i had the turkey club with avocado and onion rings, my husband had prime rib dip with restaurant made chips. both were standard restaurant menu items but both were above average in taste.  the bread on my club it was fresh and soft and it wasnt just toasted, it was grilled in butter just like a club sandwich should be! the only downside was the bloody mary, which just tasted like bloody mary mix with some big peppercorns in it and a lot of celery salt. no worcestershire  sauce or tabasco to spice it up a bit.
had dinner here last night and was thoughoghly impressed. the atmosphere is really comfortable in comparison with the menu items. hostesses at the front were welcoming as was the entire staff. was served by kristin and she went above and beyond to be sure our needs were met. never had a low drink or dirty plate on the table. when we were seated, i believe the table behind us had asked to speak to a manager. she quickly apologised and said shed be right with us. and she was. she had a smile and warm attitude throughout our dining experience despite a busy evening for the restaurant. she knew the menu items and even offered suggestions. the food was phenomenal. our table sampled each others plates and nothing was bad. i had a pasta dish that was a little bland in comparison to the rest of the tables delicious choices but it was far from being bad. the filet oscar my husband had was delicious!!!i will, for sure, be a frequent flyer here!
so pleasantly surprised with this hidden gem. simple menu, perfectly executed. we sat at the bar to wait for our table, 1520 min. they have a cool text you when your tables ready system.  as soon as we got our seat we were greeted by our server cystine, very charming. the service from the hostess, bar staff and servers are awesome. the biggest shock was the final check, 12 of what we thought it would be. so quick recap; food 5 out of 5 stars, service bar, host, server 5 out of 5 stars, price 5 of 5 stars.  if you come and are waiting on a table be please patient im almost done.
amazing food!!!! had the appetizer sampler because we simply couldnt decide which appetizer to choose; they all looked wonderful! needless to say we were very satisfied! the sangria and mojitos were wonderful as well! it does seem as if they are still working out the kinks though..as our salads came out after our main meal, but they were taken off our bill and we did receive a sincere apology. the rack of lamb was cooked perfectly and the monte cristo sandwich was amazing! will definitely come back!!!!
can you believe i had a slab of ribs and a large potato at the firerock steakhouse bar!! the food, drinks and the employees are amazing. i will be sure to tell all my friends and family about how amazing my experience was having some food and cold, cold beer at the firerock steakhouse bar!
a steakhouse that would be worthy of being within any of las vegas finest casino. the decor makes one very welcomed, with a touch of casual but fine dining. you can tell the menu was well put and thought of with not much clutter and choices that leave you dazed and confused!the meals are well proportioned and leave you wanting more. whether its a casual event or you want fining dining without going to the strip this is a definite must!
awesome experience melanie was our server, excellent service. the food was awesome i recommend the shrimp. also the rack of lamb was great seasoned perfectly, the best part was the great customer service and the ambient lighting
i dont write reviews unless theyre really good or really bad. this time its because firerock is great! we went for lunch and had a super knowledgable waitress named anjanette. my son got the cajun ribeye and said it was the best steak he has ever had. it was delicious. i had the chicken  biscuits, delicious gravy and huge portion. the northwest needed a casual but upscale steakhouse and this is it. very family friendly but also perfect for a business lunchwe will definitely be back.
i am not a huge review writer, but i must take this opportunity to say what a great place fire rock is.  our server, sammy, was incredibly helpful with drink suggestions and menu selections.  you could tell he actually cared about providing quality customer service.  now to the rest.  the appetizers we had, calamari and seared ahi tuna were delicious.  our main meals of filet oscar and ny strip were well prepared and presented.  the steaks were perfectly cooked to medium with a seared crisp outer and a juicy tender center.  we will definitely be returning, and bringing our friends along!
excellent food, good prices and a great server, kahla!  without knowing we arrived just in time for their happy hour specials 46 pm.  the stuffed mushrooms were amazing, the cioppino and the beer can chicken were both delicious!  i could not get enough of their fresh brewed iced tea!  we will be back!!!!
anjanette was a wonderfully attentive server! she was outgoing and  friendly; great smile, laugh and sense of humor. customer service on point!  there was a bit of delay with the kitchen food arriving yo yhe table, however the canjun ribeye was tender enough to eat with a fork, well seasoned and grilled to perfection. the southwest chicken sandwich was delicious especially with the yummy fry bread.  anjanette communicated  the delays and constantly checked on us. very personable and made for any enjoyable eating experience.
wife and i decided to give this newly opened joint a try, so glad we did. well be regulars im sure. bit of a wait but nothing out of the ordinary for upscale casual. sammy, our server was top notch. great recommendations, good timing and clearly someone who wants you to have a great experience. we tried the pork medallions and the beer can chicken. both were quite unique which was fun to get off the beaten path at a steakhouse. chicken was moist and cooked to perfection with that wonderful fat tire glaze. the maple and pecan medallions were tender with a very nice sweet and nutty flavor that tied together with the pork nicely. super yummy, out of the oven bread rolls had a hint of rosemary and just enough salt to mix with the butter and send you into a bread coma. be careful not to go nuts on the bread, save yourself for the entree. were definitely coming back and i think ill dive into the ribeye next time.
i never thought that we would have a restaurant like fire rock steakhouse on our side of town from the time you come in your greeted with courteous and smiling hostesses tremendous service at your table and the food is to die for nowhere near as expensive as you would expect try it i tell you youre going to love it.
we stopped in again and we are happy to announce the temperature is now perfect. we got to stay and enjoy our drinks along with the excellent food. the service was excellent as usual and not to mention when u take ur food to go they box it up in a microwave safe tupperware, love it! you will definitely being seeing a lot more of us!  loved this place the decor was on point except we were unable to stay to long because it was as cold as a meat locker here but the service was excellent. from the cucumber martini which was made perfectly next i ordered the caprese small plate which i loved the buffalo cheese was fresh along with the tomatoes next i ordered the lettuce wraps with chicken, in which the lettuce was crispy and the chicken was cooked perfect with sliced onions i loved it i cant wait to come back to this place but hopefully next time we will be able to stay longer and it wont be solo cold bbbbuuuurrrrrr...
customer service was good.  sirloin steak was amazing.  macaroni was fluffy and cheesy... must try.  house bread is different almost like hawaiian sweet bread.  fettuccini alfredo was creamy and filling.  we will be back to try more items on the menu.
another great experience! the philly steak egg rolls are amazing! all of the good taste of a philly steak in a crispy egg roll served with an a1 aioli. amazing!! dannielle provided excellent service! everyone has a smile! love the atmosphere!!!
went with my fiancee to check out this new place a couple nights ago. the place was super busy, with a good vibe. the food was great, maybe a little pricey...but the reason im giving it a 5 star is because of the service. our servers name was cistine not sure about spelling, and she was fabulous. she was super knowledgeable about what to order and especially on the wine pairings. she even went out of her way to introduce us to her manager donny who was walking by. he made sure we were being taken of. we will go back for sure....great place, great location and great service!!!
we really enjoyed ourselves. i had a ribeye that was perfect. the service was fine and the price was right. the only issue we had was that i wish there was more stuff on the loaded baked potato. we had a bottle of wine, dinner for 3 adults and 2 kids... 140.00.  i thought that was very reasonable. i signed up for the rewards club.  we will definitely be back.
wonderful neighborhood restaurant!  tonight we came out with a friend and we had a very delicious meal choicesphilly cheesesteak egg rollsshaved prime rib seared with onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, and cheddar cheese in a crispy egg roll.  served with an a1 aioli.   baked potato soup this house favorite is finished with our threecheese blend, bacon and scallions. caesar saladchopped romaine lettuce, tossed in our housemade caesar dressing, served with parmesan cheese and croutons dinner saladmixed greens with bacon, diced tomato, diced cucumber, carrots, diced egg, croutons, and cheddar jack cheese.  served with choice of dressing      filet oscarbeef tenderloin, topped with crabmeat, fresh steamed asparagus and drizzled with homemade bearnaise7 oz. cajunspiced ribeyechoice ribeye handcut and marinated in cajun spices, glazed with a creole butter mahi mahi was delicious!
all that we ordered was amazing!!! ribeye  perfection. ribs oh so good and tender. chocolate cake is a deal and delicious. sandy was our server, she was great!!!
712: 4.5 starswe had great food and great service from jess. probably one of the better restaurants in the nw. we tried it for lunch before venturing out for dinner. i had the turkey club with avocado and onion rings, my husband had prime rib dip with restaurant made chips. both were standard restaurant menu items but both were above average in taste.  the bread on my club it was fresh and soft and it wasnt just toasted, it was grilled in butter just like a club sandwich should be! the only downside was the bloody mary, which just tasted like bloody mary mix with some big peppercorns in it and a lot of celery salt. no worcestershire  sauce or tabasco to spice it up a bit. 727: another great experience at fire rock. we had some good appetizers, drinks  dinner.  the prime rib, firerock shrimp and baked potato soup were great. our bartender,  dave served our dinner  made awesome cocktails: the basil cucumber martini and the moscow mule both were very wellmade. we were surprised to walk in and see how crowded it was, considering that all of the venues that have been here before did not do well. hoping that this one continues to be busy and stays around for a long time!!
long wait but they do have call ahead seating. delicious food. philly cheese steak egg rolls were amazing. chocolate cake for dessert was great to share. very friendly staff with good recommendations
this place is awesome!  my cousin and i sat near the bar for happy hour last night.  we had the caprese salad and the crab cakes which were both delicious! if youve read my other reviews, you would know im big on service! its everything to me when i dine out. our server, kristin, was so delightful and funny and made our experience so enjoyable. i will make sure i go to this spot every time i visit vegas.
wow! came out to dinner for the first time here tonight...and the food is amazing! we were excited to try a new steak house. we definitely made the right choice! our server, amanda, was knowledgable, friendly and excellent with her service. we will definitely be back.
you must try the philly steak egg rolls! fabulous! also, the decor is stunning. love this new place in las vegas!!!
jess was the best.  made us feel like we were her only table tonight.   left overs will be great for lunch.
we have been wanting to try this place since it has opened  i so glad we did!! my son  husband each had the bacon wrapped filet with the baked potato. the only thing left on their plate was the skin of the baked potato  the sticks that held the bacon to their steak. steak was so tender  cooked just as they both ordered it. i opted for the chicken dijonnaise, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. i needed them to bring me more of the dijonnaise sauce because it was so delicious. the potatoes had just a few lumps, which i love. i used some of the dinonnaise sauce as s gravy on my mashed potato  can i just say...yum!! we tried the regular mac  cheese and that was great too! the bread was sooo soft. salad was delicious. our waiter, sammy, was fantastic  was he on it. our one  only critique is that our food could have been just a little hotter, but we will for sure be back!!
it was my first time here and everything was delicious... i ate chicken  biscuit. it was so yummy and  with very big serving size. service was good and waiters was refilling our cokes without finishing and of course i liked it !
ive found this relic from yelp and im returning the favor; delicious, large portion food. must try sample appetizer plater, especially 6 cheese arthicoke dish, beyond words... my entree was country steak and it was amazing! service was warm and well done. thanks for the amazing service britt, you are cute!
im from new york and ige thinked that the best place to eat steak is nyc till i come here... i got braised tenderloin tips and it was fabulous, their cooking style is the best ive ever seen and it was really delicious. by the i shouldnt forget the app plater, weve got sample platterstuffed mushroom, calamari firerock and sixcheese artichoke dip they were yummy. dont forget to taste their baked potato soup too. finally our waitress britt was really professional and polite...
the atmosphere and the barry manillo music that played during dinner was so tranquil so much to choose from on the menu that you want to come back to try numerous items...i had the filet oscar with a fully loaded baked potato amazingly soft and perfect taste i tried a few different drinks 1 was the sangria which was well worth the 7 in a pretty large wine glass...all in all cant wait to go back and try something different next time...
love this restaurant. nicely done inside. the service and food was great.  menu was varied and the portions a very good size. cant wait to try happy hour.
ive been wanting to try this place since it opened because i love to go out to eat.  ive been waiting though because based on yelp reviews there seemed to be some kinks to work out.  i have to admit that i was still apprehensive since the reviews seem to be great or horrible.  no middle ground.  boy am i upset that i waited.  i went for the first time on wed 819.  the food was so good that i returned on fri and sun.  3 times in one week.  i know i have a problem, but the food is unbelievable. i am yet to have something that i didnt like.  go during happy hour 46 for half off apps.  so far for apps ive had stuffed mushrooms, sixcheese artichoke dip, street tacos, calamari, and philly cheesesteak egg rolls.  each one was fantastic.  only problem is that the cheese dip never comes with enough bread.  it should come with double.  every time we need to ask for more.  for entrees ive had beer can chicken, bacon wrapped filet, and prime rib.  again every one was very good.  the best had to be the filet.  every bit as good as flemings  my now second favorite restaurant  and it costs 20 less and you get a side dish.  as for sides i have tried the loaded baked potato which was very good and the mac n cheese which was kind of disappointing but my 4 year old liked it.  i also tried the baked potato soup which was very good and a dinner salad which was also very good.  the warm bacon dressing was phenomenal.  i also want to add that they have a very good childrens menu.  i have 4 kids and they all enjoyed it.    i regards to other reviewers who said it was overpriced.  you must really be some cheapasses.  this isnt applebees.  this is a nice steakhouse!  the prices are on par or better than outback, but much better quality.  this is more flemings or del friscos quality at a much better price.     now for the bad.  the service is mediocre at best and sometimes borders on horrible.  we have had 3 different servers and although all were friendly, none were good at service.  i could walk across the parking lot to ihop and get service that is 10xs better.  i have to assume that most of their servers had never waited tables before.  hopefully they improve.  its impossible to get a soda or water refill without asking.  this is one of my biggest pet peeves.  even after you ask, they often still forget or its not a priority to them and you wait at least 5 minutes for a refill and youre stuck trying to eat your food while sucking on ice. the second time we were there we never got bread and i didnt realize until we were ready to leave.  i asked the server why we never got bread and her excuse was that there was never any baked.  really?  we were there an hour and a half and i know other tables got bread.  she should of just told the truth and said she forgot.     the food definitely gets 5 stars and makes this my new favorite restaurant, but service is 2 stars at best.
had lunch for the first time at fire rock in centennial center today. the food was awesome. totally recommend the patty melt. very high quality food and our server, trish, was exceptional. we will definitely be going back. great atmosphere and everyone in our party was impressed!
my hubby took me here for my birthday last night and i loved it! the wait for table was a little bit long but it was a saturday night  since they have only been open for a couple of months...that was totally understandable. danielle was the woman that waited on us  she was absolutely amazing. she had an awesome personality  was very attentive making sure we were taken care of. the food was delicious  my steak was perfect. prices are fairly high but totally worth it! great atmosphere here!
yum.........best new steak to come to us in a while. be sure to try the cinnamon apple whiskey cocktail. boom!
great food and service.  we will definitely be back:had the stuffed mushrooms for appetizer, wedge salad and prime rib, everything was amazing.....  finished off with lemon cake, yum!!!!
my party had the philly cheese steak egg rolls, having read some previous reviews i wasnt sure if they were going to be good. so i tried one with out the sause to see it the meat tasted froozemicrowaved, it had nice flavor and the dipping sause was greatthe ceasars salad was decent. the 8oz bacon wrap filet was very good. the filet had just a hint of the bacon flavor which mixed well with the pepper. but sadly the side stole the show for me. that mac and cheese was amazing. it was real cheese  and something in it just made my mouth water. i had to share it will my whole table so they could see how great it was. then the icing on the cake is one of my favorite waitresses from another place walked in danielle. shes such a bright personality. i am coming back for sure
went here last week the service was prompt the food was excellent and recommend highly!
we decided to try firerock for a late lunch. this place is unbelievable. everything on the menu sounded amazing and thanks to our phenomenal waitress angie, we were able to pick out some appetizers and lunch items. we had the philly cheesesteak egg rolls. dipped in their sauce these things were amazing. we also ordered the firerock burger and bbq pork sandwich. the burger is actually ground steak and the bbq pork were huge chunks of meat. each item was fabulous. we will definitely be going back and asking for angie. she was so helpful in making our decisions. our drink glasses were always topped off and the conversation with her was delightful. she is an absolute asset to that restaurant. i highly recommend trying this place out.
my husband has been hospitalized for several days and all he wanted when he got discharged was country fried steak with gravy. we tried a nearby restaurant and didnt see it on the menu, and we had passed firerock so we decided to head back and give them a try. the inside is beautiful. theyve definitely turned it around, because i still remembered that building as stoneys north forty and they wiped that from my memory tonight. our waitress was georjett and her service was awesome. our drinks never even got close to empty and she was overall fantastic. my husband was pleased to see his meal of choice on the menu, and i got the bbq pork nachos.his food was amazing...after trying a bite of his steak and the corn i told him i wished i had order the country fried steak! my nachos were great, too. georjett suggested extra cheese and made sure they were cheesy enough for me when she dropped them off. the pork was super tender and delicious and the pico was delicious. we cant wait to head back on our next date night!
great food! good service! the scallops i ordered were missing the searcarmelization, but im an amateur gourmet cook so im super picky ;
let me just start with some gratitude that we finally have a new great neighborhood restaurant! cheers to that! happy hour is amazing! 46pm everyday, 3 glasses of wine and 12 price apps... yes! gaming, full bar, delicious food, and great service. lets face it, service makes the restaurant. the philly cheese steak egg rolls are incredible, the cajun ribeye is on point, the filet is like velvet, the beer selection is decent, the rosemary bread is  super soft and fluffy and addicting. the mac n cheese gets 2 thumbs up and if you can make your way to dessert... get everything!!!! they also offer a rewards card, and about 2 weeks after i signed up i got a coupon in the mail for a free appetizer. i have gone here about 4x in the last month and have had a great experience and great service every time, from the bartenders, to the host, to the servers. i definitely recommend firerock!
this place is my new favorite and i live on the other side of town, so that says a lot!  the ambiance is great and very hip. i ordered a moscow mule and it was perfect!  lasted all through dinner too. i ordered the sirloin with asparagus. the steak was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. i havent ever seen asparagus this big either. there are so many wonderful things on the menu that ill just have to keep coming back!
firerock was great...! friendly staff,  great food and awesome ambience. i highly recommend the sangria, the baked potato soup and the ribeye is juicy and melts in your mouth.  will be coming back here anytime i get that juicy steak craving.  also,  prices are fair and they open until pretty late!
this place is amazing. i love there happy hour specials. the staff is courteous and provided excellent customer service. the bartender s are awesome. a must when your in the area. great variety of food choices with a specialty chefs touch.
love it! service is great each time we have gone. prices are right for a steak restaurant. cant wait to try more items on the menu.
i really liked this place. the location has hosted many failed restaraunts over the years.  i hope this one makes it.  a little pricey but the food was amazing. i want to go back and try other items from the menu. i had the beef dip and it was the best i have had in a long time.
i am very impressed with the quality of food and the service!  we had sebastian serve us and he was amazing!  very friendly and awesome service! definitely will be back!
excellent food, and service. if you live in the centennial hills area of town, give this place a shot.
won a good amount of  at the sports bet window...splurged in a meal. damn. went 51 years without trying foie gras. want those years back. rossini with truffles and foie gras was awesome. staff was warm, friendly and very well informed. great experience. hope to win big so i can come back soon.
this place is amazing!  we truly enjoyed the food and the portions are more than enough, even if you wanted to share.  the pricing is a bit more than say outback, but the food is better.  we loved the environment and really appreciated our server.
omg the cheesesteak egg rolls are great! i keep coming back because of them! they have a daily happy hour with beer 50 off and appetizers at great prices. last time we ordered some oysters and they were fresh and tasty. they also have a good kids menu. their menu has a lot of options, last time i have the 6oz top sirloin and my husband had the centennial special 10oz sirloin and both were cook perfect and the meat had great flavor. this place makes a good option for a family dinner. oh and their prices are reasonable.
seven of us extremely enjoyed the lunch on a tuesday with the discounted rate. the servers were friendly and made you feel at home. undoubtedly we will all be coming back.!
had a great anniversary dinner with my hubby tonight.  what a great place to eat!!!  i had a ribeye and my hubby had the bacon wrapped filet, everything was exceptionally great!!!!  we also got a free dessert
after our first visit our family is now a repeat customer. food is great. large portions and reasonable prices. good customer service. our waiter came to our table multiple times to ask how we were doing. highly recommend.
first time here and its amazing! steaks are to die for.....our server sammy was top notch and very attentive! a must stop for every family!
came back for dinner the brisket was great. service was spot on i would recommend them for sure. only negative was a little loud !  definitely will return.  bob
their pulled pork sandwich is to die for. great food and atmosphere.  a new favorite.
went there 1st time sat nite at 7. only waited about 20 minutes for a table. dave the bartender took care of us and john our waiter gave us great service.  we had the short rib ragout and a steak.  absolutely delicious. steak cooked perfectly.  rosemary bread really good. will definitely be back
i have been here a few times now as it is my fiancees favorite date night spot and we love to bring our friends too. hh is pretty cool, they could have a better beer selection but the food is really great. the philly cheese steak egg rolls are really good, and eryka  our amazing server suggested the bone in ribeye cajun style and it has become my favorite item on the menu so i already know what i am ordering when i walk in the door. dont miss out on the lobster mac n cheese. save room for dessert. its worth it! the location is super convenient and the food is always on point.
everything was great! cajun ribeye was perfect! cant wait to come back and try everything else on the menu... it all sounds delish! server was great as well!
absolutely best food in service ever highly recommend the steak was just the way i like it medium rare waitstaff was over the top the restaurant is brandnew and very welldesigned
it so refreshing having a beautiful, cozy steakhouse thats not on the strip. our entire family dined there last night and every meal was delicious. from the ribeye to the monte cristo...absolutely fantastic. plus, our waiter rick was attentive and very friendly. would highly recommend!
this hotel i must say has come a long way. the new owners definitely put some thought into remodelling it.i would highly recommend it for a short or long stay.the management was great just ask for gene he took great care of us thanks buddy!
ive been a member of fbbc for over a year. i love this place. its not just a gym its also family! ive made so many great friends. ive never met anyone at the gym that hasnt gotten results.  you must check this place out. totally worth the money!
ive been going for a few weeks now and im seeing changes in the way my clothes fit and im feeling great. they really hold you accountable and they even give you nutrition help! how awesome is that. its an all in one shop! cant wait to keep seeing progress :
love fit body boot camp, am a regular now. very friendly environment, the other attendees are cool and love working with ben  josh!
excellent event tonight. the staff was wonderful. we really enjoyed the extra activities; shell painting, balloons, pdq and sweet shop. thanks for allowing us to join the event. this was a first visit to sealife for us and we will be sending friends.
what an awesome event.  this was the first family friendly yelp event i have attended and wow!  the kids and i equally had a great time.  this was also our first visit to sea life which was wonderful.  i was certainly amazed by the eels and sea horses. the food was tasty and i am obsessed with the apples and toffee sauce provided by pdq... so much so that i took the kids there after the event for dinner  yum.  the sweet treat bar was a nice touch and of course the kids were thrilled to indulge.  the kids are still studying their passports and playing with their balloon swords.  nikki you did it again!  wonderful event all around. thank you so much for having us.  i cant wait for the next family collabo!
unda the sea, unda the sea....anytime theres a chance for me to reference sebastian from the little mermaid, im going for it! it was an evening filled with fishy friends and kiddos with big smiles. not gonna lie, the fact that there was so many children so excited to see the exhibits made me happy. i showed up childless but extremely interested to check out the new aquarium digs at the mall. when i arrived a little before six, there was already a line wrapped around toward forever 21s entrance. there were two kids behind me jumping up and down in anticipation. once i got checked in, i was greeted by one of the sea life employees and then made my donation to merlins wand. the tour of the aquarium began with a photo opp i declined and then you were off on your own to dive in. the amazingly talented tonya from pop rocks photography was going around snapping pics of kids, fish, and families. i witnessed a couple peoples first times at a yelp event and they seemed genuinely happy to have someone there documenting the experience for them. the sea life employees were on hand to work the various stations and introduce kids to the stingrays, crabs, etc. i have to say, the employees were incredible  kind and extremely friendly. ive been to a couple of aquariums in my day and i found this aquarium to be particularly geared toward young kids. i was expecting the aquarium to be jampacked but the layout and pacing really allowed for families to get in multiple phone snaps and have their kids take their time pointing out dora and make their own fish faces at the fish. there was a mini play area toward the end of the aquarium, also a table for seashell painting area. seriously, if i was a six year old, i would have lost my mind. pdq set up a mini station in the middle of the aquarium with plates of chicken tenders, cole slaw, and an apple slice with peanut butter. the tenders were very good  hot and tasty. perfect finger food for young ones. i must say, nikki executed a wonderful family event!
this was a wonderful family event. i have two older children ages 15  12 who came just for me and ended up having more fun than anticipated. my son is really into how things work and was entertained with the behind the scenes tour. we arrived about 5:45 and stood in line prior to the event start but we were able to navigate through the attraction fairly easily. the snacks from pdq and the candy table were also a hit for the kiddos as well!
i really enjoyed this event. i heard a lot of rumors this place was dull and underwhelming but surprisingly it was the opposite. variety of sharks, tropical and local fish, shell fish and sea horses. the sea life staff was friendly and educating us with facts about many of the sea creatures they have there. the exhibits flowed well together and some were even interactive, also offering tidbits about each animal and their habitat and what we can do to help protect them. the candy station was a sweet treat and pdq was there for a tasting of their menu, which i didnt take advantage of since it was meat based, but that didnt stop my friends and i from having a good time. nikki even had a shell painting and balloon craft station!
thank you yelp for inviting us to this wonderful experience. both my children and i were amazed by this place! staff was friendly, the activities were spot on and the beauty of the aquarium was unbelievable! we cant wait to go back!
i loved the fact that i was able to invite some kids along with for once.  i just dont think they would fit in at most of the other events.  this event drew a lot of attention for the venue and it looked like everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves.  winwin.there was quite a crowd when we first arrived and a line that wrapped around a kiosk.  i didnt mind the wait, but while not paying attention i almost got hit with a train, lol!  the line actually went pretty fast considering the size of the crowd and the fact that everyone was getting their photo taken shortly there after.i liked the layout of the aquarium as it kind of wrapped around and back to the beginning again.  every room seemed to have its own vibe.  some areas were a little stuffy with such a big crowd, but that dissipated as the crowds dwindled.  i really liked the areas that the convex and concave glass were in.  it gave a magnifiedcloser perspective.  the black light jellyfish were pretty cool too.  id say the big stingray room was probably my favorite.  i found two little cubbyholes on the back side of it, that were a perfect place to snack on some pdq.pdq was so great i went and ate at there right after.  that was an amazing chicken tender.  the apple slice with a nut butter was a great touch.  i dont know that ive ever had coleslaw with blueberries in it, but i certainly didnt mind.all in all this was a great event.  it was really awesome that i was able to invite a friend with kids and show them all a good time.
i have to say my first charlotte yelp event was a blast! i love that it was a family event and it was just awesome all around. my son loves all things animals and to be able to take him to the aquarium was just a wonderful opportunity. he kept talking about it and asking if it was time to go and when it was, it surely did not disappoint!!my son was all oohs and ahhs. this event was extremely well put together. i loved that they had all the staff on hand to explain the stations. and the behind the scenes tour was amazing, that is something we definitely would not have done on a regular visit to the aquarium but wow, so fun! the lady that was doing the balloon animals was definitely my favorite. she was so patient and well mannered with the kids, i just was dumbfounded at how great she was with the kids. and the arts  crafts station, was definitely a major hit with my 4 year old. our painted seashell magnet is still on the fridge and will remain there for a quite a while.having pdq there with food and snacks was the best. it was my first experience eating pdq and definitely glad that we did! we loved it and will be definitely exploring that venue soon.this was our first experience at sea life and i know i will definitely be bringing my son back. this family yelp event was a blast and did not disappoint at all. i cant wait for the next family event! yelp charlotte and nikki, thank you so much!
omg this event was so. fetch. mean girls reference!  kudos to nikki for putting on an amazing event!  sure, it was geared more towards kids, but i loved every moment!  i thought it was very organized as when i walked in through the mall entrance, i was able to see the line to check in clearly, and you had to pass by the table before being able to step foot into the aquarium part.  it was also helpful as thats where we were able to get our information books, and those were great for kids to stamp around stations within the aquarium.  also before going in, we were able to donate to merlins magic wand, which is a charity for children.  donating 5 meant we got a pin, and i definitely wore my pin proudly for the event!it was great in there as it wasnt crowded and it seemed like the kids had a lot of room to move about and have better views of the fish.  my favorite room was a circular room that just had fish swimming in the same direction.  i want that room in my future house!there was a big area where you could view the sharks, and there, the vendors were set up for us.  we were able to sample food from multiple vendors, but what stuck out to me was the candy table.  i definitely went straight there and grabbed my bag of gummies.  i really liked the set up here as it was flowing nicely and didnt block the view of the sharks.towards the end of the aquarium, there were still more activities!  there was a station set up to grab a magnetic clam shell and paint it.  my husband was a good sport and the two of us waited our turns to paint.  our shells are proudly on our fridge right now.  there were also a person making balloon animals for the kids!  it was wonderful seeing the kids all happy with painting and the balloons.  before fully walking out, we also were able to pick up some yelp tote bags.  my favorite thing in the bag?  a stress ball of the octopus!  its the cutest thing ever!man, yelp is just amazing for putting these events together!
so excited they are here. my folks live in oregon and this is great coffee!!!! great atmosphere and everyone ive meet today is super friendly!!!
i was so excited when i saw dutch bros. the other day. very happy they opened a location in las vegas. the employees are always so happy and friendly. their drinks are yummy and for a good price.
as a former resident of grants pass, or where dutch bros. originated, i was used to the driveup coffee stand culture that is so common in the northwest. since i moved out here in 2006 it has been a very long 9 years waiting for vegas to open a dutch bros. i was pleased to see that they already had a line down the block for their grand opening, as well as friendly faces to greet you while you wait. it truly is a oneofakind place with quality products at great prices! i might have to change my route to work in order to take advantage of the opportunity more frequently!!
wow! what an amazing staff to start off this review even in the 115° weather all of them had huge smiles on their faces so friendly so inviting, got my coffee and it was absolutely delicious i love that they have allmond milk as an option most places not even starbucks has that as a choice and not to mention they are open 24 hours woo hoo!!!!!
outstanding service, deliciously excellent quality drinks and the staff is such a refreshingly high spirited bunch. i was greatly impressed and it was everything i had heard about and more. i will be continuing to spreading the word of the dutchs arrival. this location is on my route to and from work everyday. i will be stopping by as finances allow. you have gained a regular in me.
came here on opening day to see what all the fuss was about. all i can say is that theyve won a new and loyal customer. service this was opening day so there was a large crowd at the service window and a pretty long line at the drive thru. the line for the drive thru went all the way down the street, but thankfully, service is really quick and we waited no more than 10 minutes from the time we arrived, to the time we received our drinks. during that waiting period, employees came up to our car to give us menus and to answer any questions we had. the employees were very friendly, helpful and enthusiastic. big plus. coffee they were giving away free 16 oz. drinks on opening day. after much debating, i finally decided on the dutch freeze kicker. its their most popular flavor so i figured id try the best that they had to offer. glad that i did. great tasting and the flavor was strong all the way to the last sip. no flavorless icy mush at the bottom when i finished. summary: fantastic service and completely happy with what i had. i cant wait to go back to try all their other flavors and items. i just wish it wasnt so far away from where i live. hopefully theyll eventually open up one in the summerlin area. until then, the tropeastern location will suffice. the distance wont deter me from getting my fix of dutch bros.!! glad to have you in vegas!!!
first its a walk up or drive through place. the energy of the employees is great. they are a bunch of young adults. very friendly and fun bunch of people.the coffee was free during their first 24 hours. i am a black coffee drinker. since the drinks were free, why not step out of my comfort zonei got the annihilator. a must try! i got mine with almond milk. i would definitely get it again.overall, location is odd but the coffee is really good and the prices are cheaper than other coffee chain.
1st 24 hours of them opening all drinks were free. i came back 4 times. the coffee is great but the customer service is amazing! this company knows how to treat each and every customer. i will keep coming back over and over again.
loved this coffee and went on the first day during their grand opening and the people they have working for them were so awesome and nice. they love what they do and they must be getting paid well. i tried the white chocolate mocha and the kicker both really good, the prices are better than starbucks and i will be back and you should go too, youll love the coffee and the service.
finally! a dutch bros in vegas! their service was on point as usual and the my order was just same deliciousness as i remember from nor cal. two enthusiastic thumbs way up!
amazing service and delicious coffee! everyone is super friendly and enthusiastic. i will definitely be coming here daily instead of starbucks. they even gave us these cute princess stickers! wooohoooo i highly recommend this place : :
ive been here twice already and it would have been more if i werent out of town during opening weekend. lol! i am so glad that my favorite nw coffee place is now here. the staff has been nothing but amazing, friendly, and happy to be doing their jobs! this place is nowhere near my home so i hope they open other locations in the valley. i will still drive over since i love them so much. : get their loyalty card, too! keep in mind, this isnt a sit down kinda place. they have drive through and walkup window only. thats fine with me.
i am from oregon and know all about what dutch is all about. but, cant wait for all of you to find out how this is not your average coffee drive thru. everyone loves coffee and everyone loves to serve it  what a concept right? if you dont believe me that this is different kind of company find the undercover boss episode and then you will know. i love you dutch and i am so very very excited about your vegas expansion !! xoxox see you all every day at the drive thru !!
usually i wait to go a few times before writing a review, but i couldnt wait this time. found this on yelp last night and thought why not try it. as i pull in the parking lot i noticed they had a good amount of customers even though theyre new. its either a drive thru or walking up to the window, decided to go up to the window. the lady greeted me very energetic, forgot to catch her name, she was very nice recommended me a drink, very tasty by the way. definitely hitting this spot again. theyre friendly, fast, and reasonably priced.
ok so i have heard lots and lots of good things about dutch bros coffee from my peeps back in fresno ca so naturally i was thrilled to find out that they opened one here in vegas. the location is some what in a weird area but the people and the coffee very well makes up for it. i trucked all the way from mountains edge to tropicana and a little pass eastern just to try them out. even though the travel was quit a far one nicole and kelly were very pleasant and nicole was awesome especially at 5 in the morning. the building looks new and drive up had easy access. the menu is simple but had lots to choose from. the prices were fair and the coffee was awesome. i havent looked into the history of dutch bros coffee yet but the ice coffee was pretty strong yet very good. the ice chai was just right. not to sweet like most places and the works comes with whip and spice topping. i love the fact that they instilled amazing customer service to their daily cup of joe because that alone makes it hard not to be a  huge fan. they also have kids items and breakfast bite with their own energizer and frozen drinks which i will absolute be back to try.thanks to the crew this morning that made me feel like such an appreciated customer and by asking for my name so that the whole staff can yell thank you rick! as i leave makes it much more personal. you can definitely bet ill be back soon and spread the word!
great coffee and great service! ive never heard of this place until a friend posted about it on instagram yesterday. was a little bummed that there isnt a place to chill inside the store but we had amazing service. i got a hazelnut kicker and it is so good! very grateful to the girl at the front of the line that recommended that. also got a muffin top that is really yummy. will definitely be back!
dog friendly and delicious coffee. we will be back!
that white chocolate mocha freeze is to die for!!! the employees are super friendly. you cant go wrong with this place. starbucks who???? i bet the baristas at starbucks never made you feel at home like dutch bros did with theyre customer service !
my friend and i finally decided to check out this place after driving by it several times. everyone was really upbeat, energetic, and pleasant. i ordered a 16oz strawberry and mango real fruit smoothie for 2.25if i remember correctly. they even had the option to substitute with almond or coconut milk for fifty cent. i chose coconut milk. it was delicious! i will definitely go back again soon. overall good experience.
this morning was our first time there! i will for sure be going back!!! the workers there are so energetic, up beat,  super friendly! i ordered the caramelizer freeze  it was delish!!! welcome to vegas dutch!!
i was so happy to drive past one night i couldnt believe my eyes!!! im from sacramento where dutch bros was an every morning, boycott starbucks, thing !!!! every drink i love !!! my boy was disappointed when they discontinued the frozen lemonades! praying they open one up on the other side of the strip because i cant drive 25 min for coffee:
about damn time vegas gets a dutch bros.!! ive only ever had it in carson city, nv so every time i visit i get a coffee or during the winter hot apple cider. mmmmm try it and fall in love...plus the price for what you get, you cant beat.
decided to stop by here because its pretty close to unlv and ive heard so much hype about this place! there menu is nice and simple and has reasonable prices. today was my first time and i got the anihalatordont know if thats the correct spelling! and i asked them to reduce the sweetness because i dont like my drinks too sweet and it was perfect! the drink has a nice, creamy and refreshing texture i cant explain and its not too heavy like other places. the customer service is awesome and they genuinely care about their customers satisfaction. the man that was serving me was named bryce i believe and stamped my card 9 times even if it was my first time! will be going back soon! : wish this was closer to my house!
hands down best customer service ive ever had. coffee is also incredible.. fresh! menu is diverse but not too big and overwhelming. unique coffee flavors for some fun experimenting.also.. must try the peanut butter and jelly oatmeal!!!
absolutely fantastic service and great coffee drinks at a good price. im so happy dutch brothers moved into my neighborhood!
first off, dutch bros has outstanding customer service! their customer service definitely surpasses starbucks or any other coffee shop ive ever been to! ive been there 4 times since theyve opened and each time im amazed at just how enthusiastic the employees are! it seems like a positive, fun, energetic place to work, and they just pass all that goodness on to every customer! even though i felt like i was being treated extra special, i know they treat all their customers with the same outstanding service! secondly, ive tried 5 different drinks and every single one was awesome! ive had the dutch freeze caramalizer and its so good! its not as sweet as a caramel frap from starbucks, and that is fine by me! ive had a cocomo, kicker, iced coffee and a dutch soda. the prices are amazing for the size that you get! im a starbucks regular, i mean, im a gold member! i love starbucks but i will have to say that i frequently complain about their prices, especially the new mini size that is not worth almost 4 lastly, they have a punch card, buy 10 get the 11th free! the first time i went they gave my whole family a card and stamped each one almost all the way through!! im big on rewards programs so this is definitely a plus!  this will definitely be my regular coffee spot!! you just cant beat their customer service along with their yummy, affordable coffee!!
went through the drive thru today 7215 around 4:15 pm. a young man with a good personality came out and took my order with his iphone. i got a 24 oz medium bob marley freeze 4.75. imagine a starbucks frapuccino with coconut and banana flavor in it...sounds weird but it was amazing. i think the building is really cute and my drink came out really fast. the only thing i didnt like was the tip jar. i find them to be incredibly tacky at a drivethruonly business. ill be back.
oh.my.gosh.las vegas finally has a dutch bros!!!!when i lived in oregon, this was my goto coffee place.  i was saddened when i realized that there was none in vegas...but at last...here it is....here it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!its worth it and you need to go.  end of discussion.  just go. dont question it, just go.
i went there earlier today for the first time and i was very impressed. the customer service was outstanding and reminds me of zappos. all of the employees which i interacted with were very friendly and outgoing. i definitely felt welcomed and that my business was truly appreciated. dustin the employee who waited on me was excellent even though he had been there all night, had he not mentioned it would never have known, as he was very upbeat.  as for the drinks, i ordered the chai tea and it was so good. i will definitely return and try their coffee.
this place rocks!!  highly friendly quick service. try the the iced cocomo.  i would expect that 10 or 12 more of these coffee shops will open over the next two years.
so extremely happy this gem has made its way to vegas! i have the privilege to pass this place every day on my way to work so of course i make a stop!! the annihilator is my absolute favorite but im trying to try every single thing on their menu! everything has been perfect so far ive have the chai tea, white chocolate mocha and the smoothies all so good! the staff is always very friendly! you guys need to open up more places in vegas !!
absolutely love the customer service here and the coffee is delicious too! everyone is over the top friendly here. ive never seen anything like it, especially in vegas.
i decided to grab coffee since i was nearby and heard good things about them. i was excited to try them out because i am a coffee lover!!! cmon i am a mama, and mama needs coffee. any coffee place catches my eye lol. anywho its located on tropicana  pecos, its a small cute drive thru place. i went around 8 am, drive thru wasnt too busy. someone personally took my order near the menu, very friendly and awake  i was half awake  hence needed the coffee . i told her it was my first time, so she suggested things i would like. i went with the white mocha  they mix it with dark chocolate and white chocolate from what i was told . everything was fast, upon pulling up to the window, everyone was friendly. the white mocha was pretty good, not too sweet. will try to go back if im in the area.
this place is amazing! i was informed through a friends recommendation and i have been telling everyone who will listen how awesome it is. im a huge coffee enthusiast and this place hits the spot. their large is 32oz and comes with a standard 4 espresso shots. for a caffeine lover like myself, thats a huge plus. ive tried almost every drink on their coffee menu and love them all. the annihilator and kicker are two of my favorites at the moment. it makes me happy to see quality food and coffee options popping up on the east side of las vegas. something to note, its a walk up window or drivethru only but the line moves quickly.
quick service! great customer service! was just passing through vegas on a road trip and stopping here was a great start to the day!!!
i just love love love them! i say this to everybody, i will drive all the way across town for good coffee and good service. their coffee is excellent and have so many good healthy options to add or change in. it is refreshing to get such great service. no complaints here 
my boyfriends sister told me about this place then a coworker mentioned it so i decided to finally try. im not a coffee drinker but this may very well be the start of me becoming one. the first time i went, i tried the white chocolate mocha iced with whipped cream  it was soo good!! i really dont like caramel but i tried the caramelizer frozen and thats my favorite so far, its definitely a must try! they have a secret menu just search online, today i tried the bob marley which is pretty much bananacoconut mocha, cant say i loved it, it wasnt bad but not something ill order again. weirdly enough, i barely tasted banana or coconut. the staff was very friendly and welcoming. my coworkers and i decided to take coffee run turns throughout the week so we can try something new each time. so far we are loving it!! cant wait to try the rest of the menu.
i love this place! they always treat me like family and whenever i come through i just tell them to surprise me! prices are pretty cheap and the size large is huge, like 32 ounces of awesome huge! they all seem like masters of their craft that really care about their customers. my family and i love this place!
first time here! i love it! 247 so i pretty much can have it any time! and its close by. the workers there are very enthusiastic and friendly!
i recently just found this place a couple weeks ago from a friend. ever since she raved about it my curiosity got the best of me. im not much of a coffee drinker but one sip and i was hooked! this place is amazinggggg. the people who work there are always so happy and ask how your day is going , what plans you have. ill definitely be back pretty much everyday.
so happy we have a dutch bros!! not only is there coffee amazing but so is there customer service!
amazing and really good!!! i will definitely be going back!!!!  i always recommend the white chocolate mocha or dirty chai!! the only downside  is that their drinks are huge, but thats not even a downside....lol... bigger is better these days right?!
dutch bros has the most amazing workers and drinks! the environment is welcoming and energetic, i am so willing to drive across town just to get drinks from them. ive tried nearly every drink they have there, but my all time favorite drink is a blended ocean water rebel! so good! go visit them!!
love this place. very friendly employees and coffee was so gooooood. i will never go to any place but here definitely stop by again
i dont drink coffee, but ive been here about half a dozen times because the staff is soooo awesomely friendly, the prices are unbeatable and the non coffee drinks taste like heaven. i am very happy vegas has its very own dutch bros... i wish they would open one on the southwest side, because a 25min travel time sucks. but i will be patient.
the good:never in my life have i had such friendly service. first time here and definitely returning. the prices for their drinks are stupid cheap. amazing coffee. i really enjoyed my iced kicker. my husband had a iced dutch chocolate. they even have goodies for your dogs here. ask for the puppychino which is just a small cup of whipped cream. the bad:nothing. although i just wish they were located next door to my house.
hilarious experience!today was all about house hunting  i asked my man to stop here before we got started so i could get my coffee fix. we pull up and this cute girl says to my man wow, what a nice car you have. i instantly thought this was weird and then i hear her ask what are you up to today?. at this point im thinking to myself is this girl serious? before i can even finish my thought she turns her attention to me and we end up having a 10 min conversation about everything  life, coffee, the company, what we do for a living, how our day was going, etc. who the heck does this? who in customer service ever compliments you or asks you how your day is going? nobody, no one cares or has time to care. saying this place is unique would be an understatement. it started off weird, got weirder but in some even weirder way was awesome. this cute girl ended up giving us free drinks because it was our first time and i had no idea what i wanted to order. i should have spent some time on yelp reading about them and i would have known this place is unique. i asked her for the kicker which has irish cream and it was fantastic! my man ordered a strawberry  banana smoothie which was super refreshing. yes of course ill be back for random conversations and bomb coffee!
i went there for the first time today. the staff was very friendly and welcoming. they suggested the annihilator for me so i had it iced. it was very good, and exactly what i needed before going to work. you can just tell they love what they do there.
date  time: tuesday,  july 21, 2015  1:15pmafter reading tons of yelp reviews, i had to try this place out. i ordered a medium caramelizer and my babe ordered a medium caramelizer freeze. both similar in taste just his had ice particles and mine was over ice.i just have to say the staff is super friendly. their customer service is excellent ! the lady that helped us at the drive thru asked if this was our first time and excitedly we said yes. her words of awsomeness oh nice, well welcome!  if you try this and it doesnt taste good, let me know and we will find something that you like. thank you for that : you are awesome and the coffee was amazingthe coffee was delious, ill definitely go back for the coffee and especially for the customer service.  price:1 medium caramelizer1 medium caramelizer freeze 8. and some change.
i was a dutch bros coffee virgin until a few minutes ago and for that i am grateful. i dont know if all the employees i encountered took handfuls of awesome happy pills or they just really love what they do, but i had a great experience. the coffee is pretty darn good too!
i am so happy we have a dutch bros and its so conveniently located in my area. i will never go to starbucks or coffee bean ever again. a 32 oz. large is only 4.75 here!!! 32 ounces!!! thats larger then the starbucks venti and still cheaper. how can you not love that?! the staff here is always super friendly and attentive! they also do a stamp card which no other coffee place does. everything about this company is amazing. i highly recommend you stop here for coffee if you are ever nearby the location!!!!!
dear cocomo  where have you been all of my life?! my friend got the 911 and i want to try the white coffee.  i am obsessed.  great prices very friendly employees that love their job which is very evident.  we were in line laughing and trying to figure out what we would like and they made sure we were happy.  if youre not coming here youre wrong.
excellent excellent excellent coffee!!!! i drove from mountains edge to check out dutch bros coffee and it was worth every mile!!!! i ordered a large carmelizer!!! it was amazing and the wonderful staff paid for my drink!!! i will be back!!! ps they have doggie treats too!
completely obsessed with this place.  not only is the coffee decently priced, the selection is amazing and the staff is all so friendly.  the staff recognizes me and my coworkers and always is very accommodating to us.one of my coworkers went and got us coffees yesterday we take turns, as she was walking into the office, she dropped the tray of three drinks.  she went back and the workers were kind enough to give her 3 more drinks at no cost.service and great drinks keep me coming back!
first off abby who was working the drive thru was awesome!  she was friendly, knowledgeable and adorable.   we talked about the coffee i normally liked and she suggested the kicker. and all i can say was wow. it had a great taste. just enough of the coffee taste w not too much irish cream.  just wished this was closer to my house
do want! thanks to linda s. for turning me onto this place after a bad experience at publicus for coffee. truth be told i actually thought this was a place to sit down and do some work on the laptop. i was excited to try a new spot that got such great reviews and was a bit sad to see it was a drivewalk up spot and not a place to chill out. my frown was turned upside down by the very cheery young lady that greeted me at the window and took my order so friendly. i had the americano with cream and sugar and it was delicious. i usually dont like others to make my coffee for me but it was spot on and for 2 for a 16oz. i was very pleased. i have certainly found my spot to pass through going to and coming from the airport on the regular. i would be there far more often if they had a customer area and wifi but im still pleased at what they do have to offer and at very reasonable prices. ill return, and thank you for the personable service...it really is a nice change of pace from the norm here in vegas.
first time trying this place and wow!! the coffee is yummy i was kind of overwhelmed at first just cause i didnt know what to order they have a wide selection of coffee and teas .i got the iced kicker its delicious highly recommend it ,all the staff was supper friendly and helpful too. will definitely be back to try more flavors . thanks guys
love love love!!! it was love at first sip. coffee is amazing! secret menu item fave so far is the rebel sunrise! yummy!!! the friendly staff is great and makes you feel like your not just at a drive thru. stamp cards are a plus by far cuz who doesnt  love a bogo!!!
thank god for good drinks, reasonable prices and amazing service. the menu is simple and the staff is rad always ready to help you and also great at keeping you entertained while your drinks are being made. this company is awesome and im stoked one opened here in vegas. im so over pretentious coffee shops with snobby baristas....we get it ur cool, just make me my  drink. its worth the trip and again, the service is way better than any coffee shop ive been to around town. high five dutch bros!
forget starbucks !!! this is my new coffee spot!! i love the friendly environment every time i come. the coffee is great! ive tried all most all of the coffees and have zero complaints. thank you for coming to vegas dutch bros!!!
love love love this place!  great staff so positive. they always turn my day around. i only wish there were more of them around.  i love their coffee and iced teas and smoothies. we no longer go to starbucks! dutch bros it is! thanks guys!
so happy that this place is finally in las vegas!! they have such a great staff here and the coffee is always delicious. dont be fooled by the line, it is worth the wait, or you can always park too and use the walk up window. keep up the good work there guys and gals!! my favorite drink is an iced white annihilator, must try!!!
hooked. everything ive tried has quenched my thirst and satisfied me.every employee is refreshing and ready to strike up casual conversation while your drinks are being made, whether its at noon or at 2 in the morning.my favorite drink is watermelon black tea, but their coffee drinks are killer too! passionfruitwatermelon are good ones for their rebel energy drinks. though its clear across town, ive made multiple trips just for this place and will obviously continue to do so. :
i wish i came here sooner! i had the kicker walmond milk, it was strong and delish. i ordered the mango smoothie for my mom and daughter. they both loved it. the service is great.  see you guys again real soon. sorry starbucks, i will be retiring my gold card.
the lord answered my prayers! try the dutch freeze...you wont be disappointed!
was never familiar with them before they moved to vegas. got wind from friends who were going nuts when they heard they were going to be opening here. checked it out for the first time today and super glad i did. first, they had a super nice girl outside by the menu to help with any questions. she didnt make feel stupid for not knowing the menu as they often do at starbucks. cant tell you how many times at starbucks i just picked the first thing i saw because i felt rushed. she helped me pick the kickstart which was there original drink. i also got a yummy frozen white chocolate for my friend. the girl must have communicated to the cashier that i was a newbie because when i drove up i was greeted with a really warm welcome and they gave me a stamp card and even started me off with 5 stamps to get me started! i will definitely make them part of my caffeine jolt rotation!
a friend took me here today for my first time! safe to say.... i wont be going anywhere else for coffee anytime soon!!! seriously fell in love with the coffee and the atmosphere they put out. theyre so personable and completely rad people. definitely make you leave feeling satisfied and happy. i only hope they open up more because its a little bit of a drive from me but so so so worth it. keep it up! the employees and the coffee was the absolute highlight of my day! thanks!!
i can only think of one person who wouldnt like this place. hes don quixote and he doesnt even exist. ive seen this place a bunch of times driving down tropicana. it wasnt until a friend from oregon raved about this place that i even figured out what it was. this place was the friendliest place on the planet. drive thru, we had a woman explain a little bit of the history of the place. she was happy. they had people inside the place waving at us. they were happy. we got our iced annihilator coffees chocolate macadamia nut. we were happy. plus, its cheaper than starbucks. plus, it was way faster than anything you get there. plus, it wasnt starbucks. get some coffee from inside a giant windmill. please. you wont regret it.
as soon as  i got up to the window, i was greeted in how every person should be greeted in a drivethru or any business establishment. kenziekenzy sorry im not sure which spelling had a great vibe and was ready with a conversation starter. idk what else to say but the mochacaramel blend i got was pretty delicious. made my little morning stroll around at 6am almost perfect. would come back again 1010.i suck at reviews.p.s. dont forget to tip.
this place is not just hype. fast and super friendly service. and not that fakesaccharine im just being nice because i have to type of service. they were pretty darn genuine.i liked the price and  i enjoyed my iced coffee. not overly sweetened either for a premixed coffee drink, which i reaaaaaaally like. also, no weird burnt coffee taste ahem, starbucks.
i was happy to see another attempt at starting a business here in my neighborhood,at this location that has seen at least 2 failed businesses already. given dutch bros always has a car or 2 or more in their drive thru they move you inout very quickly.plus they often send live people out to take your order wa device!!dutch bros will surely make it here!! i have been to the walk up window several times already and never once been greeted with anything but genuine kindness!!!! yes, they have all drank the koolaid sotospeak. i mean this in a nice way because the staff are so friendly!! even though i am monosyllabic,please dont think i dont appreciate your warmth! i do!! this is a business model for a textbookdefinitely!!! please keep up the great work and delicious coffee drinks!!
this is the second time i been here everyone treated me excellent. this coffee is better than starbucks or any other coffee place. i recommend this place to everyone.
im from the pacific  northwest  the best place to live by far . but this is about dutch bros i was pumped when i had found out they where coming to vegas . i remember my girlfriend  saying hey babe aome place is opening up by the house as soon as i saw the colors i was pumped up . couldnt  belive dutch bros was coming here. ive been in vegas since 2008 . to have a little piece of home is just what the doctor  ordered . there coffee is so fresh so good its addicting . the customer  service  is by far the best ive ever had in vegas there workers are always smiling and happy to see you . i recommend  this place to all my co workers and friends .  if your looking for a great coffee  shop look no further  then dutch bros all there items are amazing and the price is perfect  . i highly recommend  you stop in and say hello to the fine people of dutch bros you wont be disappointed.
 order the dutch freeze!dutch bros. coffee has what it takes to wipe out starbucks! this is an allaround feelgood company with a quality product. the outwardly pleasant attitude of their staff is notably part of the companys interwoven philosophy  best of all their attitude is contagious! i promise you will leave wondering what the company put in their employees water to make them so happy.ive long since grown tired of the poor quality expensive product and overall snobby service received at starbucks locations around the valley. it is also not everyday that i am willing to drive across town for a coffee. but, this oregon based company left a huge impression on me following an episode of undercover boss with dutch bros. coffee cofounder travis who went undercover in his own company.today, my son and i had the pleasure of meeting dustin and the rest of the lovely staff when we ventured through the drivethru. as first time customers unfamiliar with the menu, he listened to what we were looking for and guided us accordingly. we ordered the dutch freeze, which is a creamy, frosty espresso blend served cold. then, he made his way to the drivethru window to make sure we loved our selection. this is not a typical company experience that pushes people along so they can make more money.welcome to vegas. now hurry up and open a dutch bros. coffee in the west end of the valley so i dont have to drive so far next time! smile
they have amazing customer service. super friendly and fun to talk to. even if its  1am
went here for iced blended coffee tonight,our 1st visit.i had the anhilator,my gf the white chocolate mocha.absolutely delicious and they were ready fast!the girl at the walk up window was super nice and chatty and explained the menu in detail.what a concept!just be nice to your customers, it doesnt cost anything and they will come back.something that has become lost in the food industry and as of late.we will definitely be back!
i stopped by today driving home from work because of my best friend. she loves this place! i try not to hand out 5 stars so easily, but i just left with a smile on my face and that means a lot to me. they have a drive thru window and a walk up window. the menu is very small compared to a starbucks or coffee bean. i believe everything is under 5. this place isnt for coffee lovers imo. the coffee taste and flavor wasnt so strong. this is more about the flavors. i had the macadamia nut small iced for 3.25 tax included. i was forwarded their drinks are fairly sweet so i didnt want to sugar load. they have other different flavors like their standard with irish cream or a coconut flavor.this is like drinking a frap: its for the taste, not the coffee. i drove up to a very nice young lady. great personality. aware of this business being new to vegas. eager to answer questions. my drink was made very quickly  it was just delicious. it was like a sweet treat with a hint of coffee. it was almost a bit too sweet, but with it being summer it is a great way to cool down.if im trying to have some fresh roasted coffee beans and taste subtle nutty nuances of the hand crafted unique blend of coffee beans.. then i dont think this is the place. if i want a quick pick me up of caffeine, sugar, and unique flavor then id stop by here. would i come back? yes.
hands down, best coffee! its a brand from the north west, they are all over oregon, washington and cali. i would recommend you go daily. the coffee is amazing and the people are very friendly and upbeat!best drink on the menu: cocomo.
so if everyone could please be this happy at work all the time. omg the staff is ridiculously happy, which then makes me stupid happy and i pass that right along to everyone and its a big ole catch 22 of happiness. oh and the coffee is killer! my new fav coffee place!
wow! yeah, theres a certain deliciousness i expect in my coffee that i havent been able to get for a long time, until today! samantha made the whole exchange a pleasure, just as getting your morning coffee should be! thank you for brightening my horrible day
another great find thanks to yelp! hot and new in vegas, they are making some of the best coffee around! with an extensive, unique menu and mention of a secret menu as well as making you anything you can dream of, your options here are endless! the service here is stellar, really exceptional, we got blended coffees for my husband and i as well as a birthday cake one for my son. prices are fair, coffee came out quickly and was perfect!drive thru and walk up only, ill be back!i wish them nothing but the best and hope they expand to socal soon!
strawberry banana freeze is where its at. you cant go wrong with the best coffee ever.
i can see why this place has an all 5 raiting! the customer service is 9 on a 5 scale, you have the woman outside taking the order that greets you with a smile and provides feedback if your not sure on what drink to try and how to get it blended or iced. she asked how are day was going ect. then we pull up to the window more 9 star customer service i think they really got the art of making a 5 min friend down. since it was our first time there she told us about the stamp club and gave us an extra stamp. now on to the coffee, at the womans taking orders suggestion i tried the large iced snicker....super yum!! the balance of coffee and flavor were right on point. the size is bigger than starbucks and its cheeper than starbucks. my only wish is they get more locations so i dont have to drive clear across town to enjoy their delish coffee!
best coffee  friendliest workers ever!! if you like sweet most people choose the caramelizer. for the hard coffee drinkers that need to keep awake my go to is the double torture. they have punch cards for frequent coffee goers, but ive had them give me cards that were half stamped so ive gotten two free drinks already!! love this place!!
i passed by this coffee place when i was running errands today so i yelped them and everyone had great reviews. yelp, you did not disappoint me! i was a little confused at the drive through because they actually have some ordering for you in person.  super friendly and very helpful for my first time. the drive thru was a little crazy, but when i got to the drive through, they gave my peach green tea for free! awesome customer service, i cant wait to to try more from the menu.
great overly friendly personal service and good strong coffee. large iced coffees are super big and great for summer.  large iced double torture is my new favorite.  note there is no indoor seating only drive thru and walkup window service.
this place is just great! they have such a variety of drinks, ive been trying to try a new one each time i go! the staff is always so super friendly, the drinks are always delicious, and the pricing is not expensive. im honestly surprised there isnt always a long line! i go at crazy times though. i love this place
amazing coffee!!! get the 911 blended! so gooooooood  everyone that we met who wished there was so nice and so friendly.  will definitely be going back.
i love coffee, and conveniences. this place is not convenient, but it takes this kind of place to make me drive across town for this coffee. the coffee isnt out of this world, but the customer service is the best!!! also, the freezes are perfect for a summer day. also kristen at the window was super friendly! awesome employee! definitely coming back!
we were first timers today! we will definitely  be back because of the great coffee but even more so the service. i dont know what they put in their coffee but these people were so friendly and excited to have us. great way to start off the day. hayley and i think their names were dustin and kristen  at the window...maybe not their names...but all so awesome. service like that is hard to come by. thanks again!
my husband and i had our first dutch bros experience in fresno, ca. our family was always raving about it and posting things on social media. i think in two days we went 5 times lol. the cocomo is my favorite when  im in the mood for something quenching. if i need a caffeine kick i go for the 911! love the flavor and the energy that follows it! it is more than apparent by the majority of reviews that this place is amazing. the flavor is great, the prices are fair, the employees are extremely knowledge about their products and the friendliest in town.
so amazing! the coffee doesnt have the burnt taste that other coffee places have! they are super friendly and really fast, the stamp cards are also a huge plus!
love love love this place! the coffee is some seriously good stuff and the employees are so friendly. ive tried every single item on the menu and when i mentioned that to the barista she whipped up something special just for me and it was on her! i never expect free stuff other than my free coffee when ive filled up my stamp card so this was a pleasant surprise. the only gripe i have is that they dont have a location closer to southern highlands!
best. coffee. ever. as an oregonian i was so excited when they opened in vegas and they did not disappoint! super friendly staff and delicious coffee choices, very happy they are in vegas!
very memorable first visit.having never trying dutch bros. coffee before, i scoped out their menu as i drove up to their drivethru line. hmm, lots of fun sugary concoctions. i usually am trying to watch my sugar and calories, so my normal orders are americanos or regular coffee. boring! i have to try something different, right?!?i see white coffee available was added to the menu. what is it? in a nutshell, its coffee beans processed and roasted at different temperatures compared to the typical brown coffee beans we usually see. the result? no bitterness and they retain a lot more of their caffeine. the friendly staff explaining this said its probably equivalent to a little more than 2 shots of espresso. cool, lets try it!the taste? not impressed. i didnt have them sweetened it so the best way to describe the taste is unsweetened milk, literally. i sipped on about 14 of my drink to see if itd grow on me. nope.i was beyond wired. you know when you actually feel hot from your body temperature rising, like after youve been out in the sun for hours? lets just say it kept me up through my whole shift at work. my breaks were spent typing on my phone, my caffeinatedjittery fingers googling about this white coffee and its process. i finally felt normal after 2:30am. i drank that darn coffee at 4pm.since then, ive gone back a few times. i ordered my standard goto drinks, the kicker, and all of them have been great. they offer soy and almond milk, and sugarfree torani syrup flavorings. their location is very convenient for me, since its not far off my route towards work. theyre open 24 hours. love it!but what brings me back is their awesome staff. so friendly, outgoing, each one of them have been very personable, patient, and helpful!when i went back the very next day and told them my first experience was drinking their white coffee, their reply was wow, youre a brave soul... have you slept yet?!any other yelpers who try it, please... let me know your experience! im dying to know. other than that, id have to say dutch bros coffee won me over!
1st time visit great coffee fast service was very surprised since line was so long everyone very happy and helpful if your near by its worth a stop for sure will be back again
the energy of this place is absolutely amazing! what stood out the most was having someone greet me at my car while i waited in the line to ask for my order to speed up the drivethru process. for those going to dutch bros. for the first time i would recommend trying the kicker! i religiously get my morning coffee fix from starbucks but will be going to dutch bros more frequently. :
coffee is life and this place is definitely coffee. 2 for a medium americano which is actually the same as a venti at their competitor. they also offer what is trenta size, which is their large, for only 3. on thing i like is that they round off all their items to the nearest quarter so you dont get them small coins. the staff is friendly and sociable, creating an inviting atmosphere. the weird thing here is that for the drive thru, a person walks out and takes your order on  a smart phone rather than you order in a talk box. the only downside is that there is no room to sit inside, as you can only order drivethru or order from a booth. they also have a stamp card which allows you to get a coffee after 10 drinks.
only coffee shop i will go to! very friendly staff and awesome vibe! goodbye starbucks! hello delicious dutch bros!
yes yes yes yes!ive been coming here since before they even opened! the staff is so incredibly nice! ive talked to tons of people there already and i am considered a regular. their coffee is delicious and well as their smoothies! waaayyy better than any coffee shop ive been to before! only downside is the line can be long which if youre in a hurry can be a downer. but the times where ive had to wait, there seems to be a staff member chatting with me at my window so it passes the time! great place and worth checking it out! :
this is place is awesome. i heard all the hype about it and i wanted to try it for myself. i thought it was only drive thru, but there is a small parking lot and you can order at a window as well. the service was amazing. these workers are soo nice. they are very chatty and will make conversation with you like you guys have known each other. it was my first time there and i was overwhelmed by how many drinks there were. she described the drinks and helped me pick the one i wanted. the drinks also came out super fast, so i didnt need to wait.i got the kicker, it was just an iced coffee. i thought it was going to be ordinary but no.. it was delicious. it wasnt too sweet and wasnt to strong to my tasting. since it was my first time she gave me a stamp card with 5 extra stamps, i thought that was so thoughtful. this place is great, i will definitely be back.
dutch bros makes me wish i lived in las vegas and wasnt just visiting! my sister, a local here, told me that the staff makes a special effort to get to know their customers on a personal level  she was right! they remember your name and are always cheery and enthusiastic. its obvious that this customer service is genuine and consistent, because dutch bros is always hopping! being busy doesnt slow them down, though  the delicious drinks are delivered rapidly!oh, the drinks though. the menu boasts a wide variety of coffees, cream drinks, energy slushies, and everything that a person could ever want to drink. i recommend the shark attack rebel for an energy boost!
oh how i missed dutch bros. i first heard about them when i lived in oregon for the first time. became a daily stop on the way to work. loved the fact that it was a drive through. our barista remembered us every single time and had our regular ready to go. fast forward to moving back to las vegas. no dutch bros so i became a starbucks junkie. i love me some coffee. always lamenting on how we wished there was a dutch bros here in vegas. then i read that one was coming! i was super happy! it had been four or five years since i had me some db. i was there the first week it opened and probably two or three times a week now. i would go a whole lot more if it were closer. the service is always top notch. they are always happy and smiling. always in great moods. havent had a bad experience yet. the coffee itself is always just right. i drink black coffee so its hard to mess that up but i try a different flavored one every once in a while like the cocomo and 911. both were great. a little sugary but thats because im used to black coffee with nothing in it. my only issue is with the lids lol. ive become used to the starbucks lids and the db ones are just weird in comparison. but the messages in the cup lid are pretty cool. all in all. db is the place to be. great coffee. great people. great service. ohh!!!! and try the cranberry orange muffin top!
omg!i am in love with this little coffee shopdrivethru. i stopped by, just wanting something to quench my thirst, and got an iced irish coffee and lemon poppy seed muffin top. both items were delicious, and i instantly regretted not buying a larger sized coffee. i wish there was a location closer to me, but for now i will make the commute just to get more of those amazing muffin tops :
after picking up a few of my books at unlv, we decided to try this dutch brothers coffee that my entire summer class kept raving about. i am not a fan of coffee bc i am highly sensitive to caffeine but it was a saturday earlyafternoon so i thought why not. we rolled up to this teenie driveup with a windmill emblem. a young lady was taking our orders on her phone. we told her we were first timers and although there was a long line, she happily explained the process to us along with their popular drinks. we ordered our beverages and as soon as we drove up to the window, everyone, and i mean everyone inside the little building greeted us with a genuine smile. the drive thru lady noticed i was wearing a rebel shirt and she wished me an awesome  successful semester so sweet!. our drinks were amazing!!! not too sweet; a perfect balance of coffee and milk. and they offer other milky alternatives for the lacties like myself soy, almond, coconut, etc. they even have drinks for the kiddies too! my five year old loved his strawberry smoothie! so glad this place is close to school!
oh happy day!  i found out about a month ago that vegas got its first dutch bros.  my relatives live in washington state so thats where i first found out about them.  i live in henderson so its a bit out of my way but worth the drive.  their black iced tea they use harney  sons paris tea is the best, and so hard to find anywhere else.  their employees are over the top friendly and very efficient.  cant wait till they build more, hopefully one or two in henderson....?  :
where do i begin? im from eugene oregon and lost my mind when i found out they finally came to vegas!! the service is the best in town and their iced kickers are the best coffee youll ever try. the owners kelli and cory are the best people on the planet. come here even if its out of your way and you wont regret it. this is by far the best company to happen to las vegas. they actually care about their customers and want you to leave happy. i love you dutch bros!!!
finally had a chance to stop by dutch bros and man this place is awesome! the girl never got her name at the drive thru was extremely nice and she made my first visit really great. i would recommend to google their secret menu. my girlfriend got the bob marley and its definitely my favorite. great prices and amazing coffee! definitely coming back!
its hard to come across good coffee here in las vegas. im usually very disappointed but, this place is amazing. i wanted to try something simple so i got a wet cappuccino. it was perfect. i have a sweet tooth but didnt have to add any sweetener to it, which tells me a lot. i finally found great coffee.the staff is incredibly sweet and helpful, they made my experience that much better. i will definitely be back to try their other products. the fact theyre open 24 hours is a huge plus and the punch card is a great incentive.
so delicious and friendly staff!
great coffee and great friendly service. also nothing against starbucks but this place is cheaper.
its was awesome... they will make what ever you want... and oh oh oh so creamy.
so far my favorite coffee spot in vegas ... i could go there everyday 10 times a day !!!! the iced caramelizer is aaammmaaazziinnggg .. everyone is super friendly and the service is really quick !!! i highly recommend this place to all the coffee lovers !!!!
considering ive filled up 5 stamp cards since my first visit i figured it was time for an update! still love this place and i still wish there was one closer to the southern highlands area but since they just arrived in vegas ill have to be patient. the coffee itself is amazing! no other coffee place in vegas has as rich of a flavor as dutch bros. also, i have a massive sweet tooth and the fact that i never have to add any sugar to my drink says a lot! the other night i came here before my graveyard shift and there was a line in the drive thru out to the street 4 cars in front of me to be exact. i think to myself good thing i left extra early! to my amazement i was through the line and i had my coffee in my hands in less than 10 minutes! amazing considering the car in front of me was picking up 4 drinks. no matter what hour i come here there is nothing these employees would rather do than make you some coffee! i usually get an iced 911. the other night the girl at the window suggested adding pumpkin flavor to it and im glad i took her up on it! it was delicious. in a nutshell dutch bros has a forever customer in me! i hope these employees get paid well because they take some real pride in their work!
had dutch bros for the first time today and they did not disappoint. fast and friendly service. shoutout to haley for selling me my first cup. she recommended the kicker as my first drink and it was the bomb!!! im definitely coming back for more. the asian dude with the awesome coin case
im not much into coffee so i came by for the tea, which was enjoyable and affordable compared to starbucks prices. they can do hot or cold, green or black, and you can add from their fruit flavors as well. i went for my favorite of iced peach green tea, and im only sad that i didnt get more. the customer service here was great since i was greeted with a smile and enthusiasm, and the lady helped me narrow down coffee selections for when im feeling risky enough to have some. started me off with a halffull stamp card, which you get stamped for any size and you can redeem it for any size drink with as many extra shots and addons as youd like. i dont like coffee since most of it tastes like butt and broken dreams, so im quite excited to try it here since its been said theyre pretty sweet. if i wanted caffeine, id take a pill, but if i want a treat i like mixed coffee drinks. they do not have indoor seating, but i have never really understood why folks like to drink their coffee at a shop, so the drive thruwalk up setting is quite preferable for me.
positive vibes all the time! open 24 hours too! every time i go here nothing but great and friendly employees! i always get the kicker ! today i went got my free coffee and a cinnamon donut one of the employees recommended to me! happy i went with her suggestion! i always get my moneys worth going here! line is always long, i never wait that long so i dont mind! i want to try their infused teas!
so good! i am new to the coffee drinking world so flavored coffee drinks really yank my nag. my friend said he heard that dutch bros was really good so we trekked across town on a saturday night to check it out. first impression  very small establishment, walk up and drive thru windows only. they do have a couple of tables outside. we did the drive thru. the girl hanging out the window literally was extremely nice and friendly. when we told her it was our first time she didnt get that annoyed look on her face like they do at other coffee places. we ordered an iced medium annihilator and a pocahontas with salted caramel. the gal at the window stood there and talked with us until our drinks were ready. when the other gal brought our drinks to the window she took the time to say hello to us. so those two drinks came up to 7.50. did i mention that the mediums are 24oz? you can get anything iced, blended or hot blended costs a little more. they asked us to taste the drinks before we left to make sure they were good. oh yes! delicious!! customer service is a big deal to me, and they have that down.i will go back again and again but i think i will ask for their suggestions. if youre in the area you should stop by. but it is worth the drive as well.
every time i go dutch bros i have a great experience, the staff is always so welcoming and nice, during my most recent visit a young lady named chole was working and was very sweet and helpful! i highly suggest you go check this place out! get the cocomo its so goood!
friendliest broistas and yummiest drinks in vegas!  enjoy your coffee outside on their tables or in your car, either way it will be a great experience.. guaranteed to brighten anyones day!
this coffee is damn good! im not a coffee fan either. in fact dutch is the coffee i drink. i prefer a large with extra ice for what ever flavor im getting. the staff is always super pumped and always nice. the drive thru is the worst part. but as long as you dont have a crew cab dually like me youll be fine. but most of the drives thrus suck in phx too. great coffee drinks!
okay... its dutch bros coffee. its either the drivethru or walk up window and its good. but what really makes me want to give this particular location 5 stars is the service. the employees are so friendly and eager to help you get your coffee as quickly as possible. although, they do not sacrifice human contact and conversation to get you in and out as quick and possible. if you prefer the talk to a machine, pay, grab your coffee, and drive away only exchanging a my day is going well this is not that place for you. but if you dont mind some light, friendly conversation while they take your order next to your car with an ipad and also at the window while picking up your coffee, this is the place for you.going here always brightens my day, and my dogs as well, since they always give him a treat and lots of love.
love dutch bros! im from oregon and moved here over a year ago and ever since you opened i drive 15 miles just to come get my blue raspberry rebel!
great coffee joint. gimme a kicker all day! nwa blasting in the drive through. hottie chicks working there.
love dutch bros! coffee is always great and the service is exceptional! they know my regular drink and are always super friendly and excited to be there. always makes my morning
i came here on the 24th with my friend so that she could get her free coffee for her birthday. my friend is from oregon where dutch bros originated and swears they have the best coffee. i think she is a little biased..we went through the drive thru and i actual person walked up to my vehicle to take our order... no talking through a static box here. the young lady that took our order was super friendly and chatty. my friend ordered a really lengthy titled iced coffee that i can not for the life of me remember the name of and i order an iced chai tea. holy large. i was not expecting the large to be as big as it was... usually when i order large iced chai teas from other coffee shops it is like 16oz and 5.. the large here was 20oz and less than 5 dollars and quite tasty. the young lady at the window was as equally friendly as the first one we encountered. my tea was delicious. the experience was an overall exceptional one and i will be returning when in the area.
great coffee!!!  my fave is the annihilator iced!! each experience has been great so far... the ladies here are super sweet  friendly.. and the fact that this drivethruwalk up service stays open 247 vegas style.. even better! cant wait til i actually need the white coffee or the 911!! definitely walking distance to unlv... i still prefer driving there... drivethru line can be long.. but worth the wait! i really do hope they open more locations... a little closer to the southwest side.. hinthinti loooooove  gotta have my double torture hott my fave winter drink
my love of dutch bros started back in portland, and gresham, oregon. the atmosphere this place brings to both young kids, and adults is one of positivity with added enjoyable conversations. the people that work here are constantly in an upbeat mood, which is what any establishment wants, but how many actually attain? their attitudes are natural and they exude it in such an energetic way that you experience the amazing coffee and the fun personalities that lay behind each cup made. i come here several times a week with my son and my dog often enough. what originally attracted me to this coffee house, were the numerous dairyfree options they offer. my son is has an allergen that causes him to be dairyfree, while i happen to just be lactose intolerant big difference so having a coffee place that adheres to that difference makes the experience only more enjoyable because no order is too complicated for these guys! the professionalism is their underneath the laid back, fun nature of each character that works there. the coffee is superb, and the price is super reasonable versus consuming super cheap french roasted beans from starbucks. the coffee itself has a deep, rich flavor alone, pair that with a sweetener, and you have a better quality fancy drink then starbucks, or coffee bean can offer you at a much better price. they also offer stamp cards that if you follow them on instagram or facebook, they offer certain deals on days where you can achieve more stars off of one purchase. in oregon, it is a very animal friendly place so it is only natural they also have drinks for dogs like the complimentary pupachino! in the long and short of this review, it is a must to check out, you wont be disappointed! may your coffee be as strong as your eyebrow game! dutchbroslife
this place is tha shit in a stick !i love it! bomb coffee... cheap and fast as hell!
only my second time strolling through off tropicana; its cheaper than starbucks, and quite frankly much better than starbucks. they have an assortment of doughnuts and many different flavors to supplement your coffee with. my second time through and i picked up a maple and pumpkin doughnut, and to drink i ordered the kicker which contains irish cream along with half n half, and 4 shots of espresso if you get the large.the staff here is unbelievably friendly. they come out and take your order on a cell phone while you wait in the drive thru line. she took the time to explain some of the menu items to me and even made some recommendations. while i waited at the window for my drink to come, the girl chatted me up the entire time. keep up the good work.
creamy irish coffee blended in awesome way. hot or cold depending on weather. starbucks may want to take a notice on this awesome new establishment.
excellent!  and most amazing coffee selections!  staff cant seem to go outside of them! very addicting!!!
always great service and fast. great prices. and of course awesome coffee! god bless this business and the people who work there.
wow! ive been a bucks addict since 1990. but i have say....if you want a phenomenal frost or frozen drink...this is the place. awesome smoothies as well. the thing i love the most is their customer service. love this place. now, please open one in henderson!
had to give this place a try, and i convinced the boyfriend to drive us down there while we went looking for halloween costumes in the area. keep in mind that im not in a rush because its our day off and such... boyfriend takes us to the drivethru, and theres only 2 cars ahead of us. when its down to 1 car in about 15 minutes, the boyfriend starts getting antsy and slightly irritable cause he just sees the order taker chat with the customers ahead of us. i see 2 drinks, and... gah! are they ordering a third one or did they mess their order up?! my response: you got somewhere else to be right now? were going shopping for you, and all im asking is to try this place out cause they got great reviews for customer service and tasty drinks! yup... that got him to be quiet. getting up there, i order the cocomo, and thank goodness i ordered a medium cause that thing was the size of a starbucks venti! lol. thank you fellow yelp reviewers for the headsuptip! the drink was sweet the way i like my cold coffee beverages, and i can taste enough coconut flavor to know it wasnt overpowered by the chocolate flavor! anyway, i can now see why people enjoy their customer service. quite personable and friendly staff. before we even ordered, the young lady working the drivethru was trying to find common ground for small chat. what was really impressive was that she managed to continue the conversation while we waited for my drink, had me try my first dutch bros. beverage, then get a small critique on how much i liked it. ive got a sweet tooth like no other, so of course i liked it! hella hella man! lol. leaving was hilarious cause you remember how the review starts off with my boyfriend cranky about the wait? well... he ended up just as impressed and probably just as giddy cause of how nice the customer service was! yup... ive found my coffee spot, and its great to have it close to unlv!
this place is awesome! definitely give a shoutout to jeremy who works late at night, definitely was a nice guy who has awesome people skills! love this place
i cant imagine giving these people less than 5 stars. the customer service is the best ive had in my many years of living in vegas, and the drinks are awesome. they can customize any drink for you while they make conversation. this place is amazing, i highly suggest you try it out.
well im definitely a fan and regretting all those years i was living in arizona and didnt have dutch bros :  please open one in california!  they would seriously do sooo well considering the huge population of coffee drinkers and many different college campuses all around.after scrolling through yelp and looking at photosreading reviews  asking for recommendations, i went ahead and ordered the iced annihilator.  i was told it is a very popular drink and i can definitely see why!  at first i couldnt taste the macadamia flavor to it, but after a few more sips, the flavor grew stronger.  i loved it.  i was told that a lot of people order the white annihilator which is when they add pumps of white chocolate to your drink and i am definitely going to try that one next time.i also loved how affordable the prices are, especially compared to starbucks!  please open a location in southern california!
this place is awesome, and not just because it is open 24 hours.  i love the kicker, iced. their coffee tastes amazing ive been a few times and everytime it was good.. even then i got the large size! .  also tried the hot chocolate which was good too. cant find my stamp card but  i dont care, its still worth it! sometimes i want to take a drive and even if its about 20 min away and 3:00 in the morning... you can always use some good coffee!  have also had super nice customer service each and every time, whether it be at the window or in the drive thru!ps. also saw the dutch brothers episode of undercover boss, it was really good!
this place has great service. my first time was tonight, and i was unfamiliar with the menu, they took the time to go over it with me and were so personal. since it was my first time i got extra stamps on their stamp card, which was awesome! i had the iced chai tea and it was amazing, better than starbucks in my opinion and cheaper. i think i have found my new go to for coffee! its a must try!!!
this place is so friendly and fun. so far i have enjoyed what i have ordered. chai tea lattes are yummy here. i like that they come to your car for face to face ordering service. overall the person who takes your order is a ray of sunshine. i only wish they would have a location in green valley!
i am so happy to have found this place! their coffee is seriously addicting. and not to mention how cheap it is compared to all the other coffee shops in town. the staff memembers always go above and beyond to get to know you better and help you decide what else to try. i live soooo far from this place but i do not care, its worth the drive. currently on my second stamp card going on my third. that is how many times i have been here. i usually do the kicker because its such a classic taste to it. creamy, sweet but not overly sweet and just perfectiontakes a sip of my kicker lol.  yummmm
i love dutch brothers! i lived in southern oregon they originated in grants pass for a couple of years and quickly came to appreciate these little coffee shacks. this one the first in vegas is awesome! the staff is super friendly typical for db the coffee is great, and theyre open 24hrs! always a sweet treat for the whole family! my kids love their notsohot chocolate, when its cold out  their smoothies when its hot.
i love their coffee. i just want to say i love their customer service. ever single time i come they have such a great positive attitude when working. they send off positive vibes making my day great!
im so glad this shop opened up down the street from me. i have not been to starbucks since. the people are great, its very fast, and im always getting hooked up. not to mentions my white chocolate mocha freeze is way better than starbucks white chocolate mocha frap.this is the only coffee shop i got to. i highly recommend it to everyone.
friendly and non stuck up coffee shop. plus the iced black coffee is flavorful, and not bitter or stale tasting. hard to find good iced coffee.the decaf iced coffee was not as fresh tasting as the original in my opinion. cup size is fair !!!!! if you order iced it comes in a larger sized cup then a hot coffee would. no loss of coffee from ice space. price is great ! iced coffee starting at 1.50 is wonderful. this place rocks, hope the chain opens more around town. note:no indoor seatingdrive thur 247
if you dont want to read a long thing, basically what i express below is that when you go to dutch bros youre going to love your drink my fave is the iced annihilator, but youre going to be in love with the employees. its a life changing experience. go there.i cannot stop telling everyone i meet about vegass newest coffee shop, dutch bros! the drinks are fantastic, but what has me going back on a daily basis are those awesome people working there! they have changed my life, seriously! every time i go there my day is better because of them! they talk to you like youre their best friend, its impossible to not be uplifted by their friendliness and sincerity. ill go there after work at 2am theyre open 247, hell yeah! just to talk to them about my day, which sounds weird, but i swear they get me. the dutch bros homies have the best customer service i have ever seen, and in turn, they have inspired me to have better customer service at my own job. so many great things have happened at my work since i started going to dutch bros, and i can only hope that i could have the same effect on a person that everyone in the dutch crew has had on me. i truly believe they are making vegas a better place, one drink at a time. love you guys!
the coffee here is amazing and they are crazy about customer service!
one word to describe this place: amazing! just tried dutch brothers for the first time and i was pleased with the service and the coffee. i got the 911 and it was too delish! most shots of coffee tastes too condensedacidic, but their coffee is smooth. needless to say, i will be back here again very soon! even if they are really busy like around 8am when i went they still manage to be friendly and personable. you dont get that at starbucks or any other coffee joint.also, i got extra stamps for it being my first time there
wish we had one on maui! went twice during vacation in vegas. service was great both times. talkative friendly girls. but what gives it 5 stars is the coffee itself! sooo delicious, not a fan of white mocha at starbucks but their white mocha is soo yummy!
friendliest service ive ever received at a coffee shop!! im a plain coffee kind of gal and their americano didnt disappoint. we will be back!
i would give ten stars if i could. not only is my coffee delicious but the staff just completely made my morning with how friendly and personable they are. being a hairstylist, i know how important customer service and quality is and from a business standpoint, these people are doing everything right. i drove all the way from summerlin to check out the hype and it was well worth the 30 minute drive. i will definitely be back!
never disappointed with dutch bros! started coming here since i started school at unlv and i cant stop now haha.
this place is always a joy to grab a coffee at. after visiting sometimes i feel i dont really need the coffee after talking to the people that work there. very reasonable prices, great customer service and delicious coffee! i usually get the 911 cuz im usually in the need for a strong pick me up. ive also tried their frozen dirty chia also a great pick me up!
this coffee is stong reallly reasonably priced and the environment is always a pleasure youngins chillin enjoying life lol. there is no reason you shouldnt try this coffee.
finally got to try this! and yes the staff were really nice and friendly, and would even ask to customize your drink the way you want your coffee  and sure enough, you get the taste you want!  i cant wait for db to beat starbucks in sales! haha
this is a smart place.   the coffee is great; the people are great; the service is graciously efficient. there is one problem....we cant stop telling people about it; which means now we may have to wait two minutes for our next fix.  we hope they continue to do well; i think additional locations would do well too; i think additional locations in henderson would do very well... go ducks.
the service here is awesome. the location in vegas is drive thru only. i ordered the kicker, forgot the ingredients in it but it was so so delicious. they also have really cool flavors for their chai latte that arent on the menu. my friends ordered peach chai latte and black berry chai latte, both were delicious. the price for all drinks all the same, forgot how much is a large.  small: 3.25   medium: 3.75
tried it out  because ive seen it and was curious.  the people there are so awesome and social.  their coffee have fun and cool names and they are 24 hours yes! ive been coming back ever since but i am trying to cut down because the downside is their coffee is a little more expensive than im use to.  especially if you are getting large blended.  their large hot coffees are a little smaller in size than im use to as well.  i drink alot of coffee and when i saw the cup i thought they were giving me a medium when i ordered large but to my disappointment it said large right on the cup.  its okay though because their double torture is strong enough to suffice.
i love this place. there coffee is wonderful. i love it while you waiting for your drink the person at the window talks to you and see how you doing and what you doing. thats good friendly customer service.
top notch. i dont even like coffee and i find myself ordering drinks when i go get my wife her fix. nomzzz
i first heard about dutch bros on facebook when they first opened up in vegas. the store is about 20 minutes from my house but i heard nothing but good things about it. finally went today and it did not disappoint! erin, the girl working the window was so nice and told us about the drinks because we of course had questions. it was definitely worth the drive and we will be back again and again and again!
amazing service. amazing coffee! today was my first time there and i am not surprised it has 5 stars. its about a 25 minute drive from my house, but so worth it!
very good coffee! i had the iced caramelizer and my bf got a hot kicker, and they were both very yummy! very sweet and helpful staff as well! once we told her that we were first timers, she gave us suggestions on what were the most popular and which is her favorite, so i thought that was very helpful! our drinks definitely didnt disappoint. im just sad that they only have one location and its so far from mi casa lol
i love the dutch soda here , and it comes in many flavors to choose from. get it with whipped cream and it is perfection.
sorry starbucks, but dutch bro takes you out by a landslide with drinks and service not that starbucks service was hot anyways.i pulled up to the drive thru and ordered a chai tea latte. their drink is made with black tea, milk and honey with all the fixings whipped cream, nutmeg, and cinnamon. the lady who greeted us at the window leaned over and made small chat while i waited for my drink. you can tell that the employees here are genuinely happy and understand what awesome customer service is.. and its not just one employee, but the entire staff.the chai tea latte itself was delicious and you can really taste the black tea and a slight hint of honey.good job dutch bro for snagging the awesome people who make your company awesome!
their coffee is delicious!! the ladies there are awesome and nice. very helpful!! will definitely come back!!
best coffee ever!!! finally a place to get amazing iced coffee. the kicker and carmelizer are my favorite. not too sugary, its just right and you actually taste the coffee! something i cant get at starbucks or coffee bean ever. the price is amazing, employees always gave a great attitude, and i just love it all! oh and the strawberry kiwi green iced tea... heaven!
dutch bros. coffee!! forget starbucks and the other super overpriced coffee chains. i am so happy they have opened a dutch bros coffee here in las vegas. first of all, they have superb customer service in which definitely takes them apart from the rest of the coffee chains. you can order at the drivethru, or park and order from their windowfront. at the drivethru they personally come out of the little shop and to your car window to ask for your order. then, once you get to the window, they actually care to be a part of your days experience. i have never left dutch bros without a great conversation with their staff, theyre pretty awesome!as for the coffee itself, its pretty darn yummy! on that note, definitely even tastes better than a typical starbucks cofee its waaaay cheaper! so, for good coffee, excellent service and affordable price, dutch bros is definitely the way to go. now, they just gotta open up more shops through las vegas!!
friendly coffee house!  i learned to enjoy dutch brothers when i was in oregon, and am so glad they opened one in vegas.  so happy!
the best coffee ever. not only are their drinks delicious, but the ladies who work there are absolutely amazing. its hard not to leave the drive thru with a smile!
i havent tried anything but the annihilator  lemon poppyseed muffin top. buttttt let me tell you, the drink is great! whether you get it hot or iced, it hits the spot. the muffin top tastes just like any other regular muffins out there. i think what really makes this place great is the customer service. sometimes i feel awkward cos idk how to talk to make small talk lol. but the workers here are so friendly and happy! they really seem like they like their job  it shows.their coffee is amazing but idk if its wayyyy better than starbucks or something? i think its really the workers that make it an exceptional place.
i am so happy to have discovered my new goto coffee spot!! i love their coffee! i usually get an iced kicker i highly recommend you try this one.. sometimes a caramelizer.. or the 911.. they all taste great. a friend told me about the bob marley or rastafari coffee on their secret menu, which has banana and coconut flavors. sounds weird, but it was actually pretty good. they also have kidfriendly items on their menu, which is a plus for when ive got my nieces and nephews with me.dont be intimidated by the lines when you drive up  the lines both drivethrough and walkup move fairly quick. the servers are extremely friendly; sometimes its creepy when they pop half of their body out of the drivethrough window to have a quick, friendly conversation with you while youre waiting for your coffee, but you will mos def appreciate their personable skills afterward. where else can you get treatment like that?? and consistently?? not at starbucks..
i love dutch bros!  i have tried the annihilatior bother iced  frozen, the carmalizer iced, white mocha iced  my new favorite the candy cane mocha iced.  all were so good!  the customer service is above amazing. when you order then pick up your drink you dont feel like you are just being herded through the line. they make it personal, they ask how your day is, what you are going to be doing  when we have our son with us they talk to him too which he loves.  they have plenty of options for children  any drink can be made with decaf. just writing this review makes me want to go right now.
amazing staff!! always friendly!!! amazing coffee!! the prices are very reasonable compared to other mainstreamed coffee shops!!! i always find myself going out of my way to grab me a cup on coffee from dutch bros!!!
my favorite coffee place! : i love the caramelizer and the customer service! try this place!
so much better than starbucks and im a starbucks fan.  great customer service and its close by.  wonderful neighborhood feel.
soo good how can it get any better? it deserves all the rave and as a mother of four i definitely need all the coffee i can get my hands on!
this dutch bros. location has the most hospitable staff out of all of the coffee shops ive been to in vegas! my last visit, my friend was trying dutch bros. for the first time and they upgraded her small drink to a medium for free. even at 11pm at night they were very excited to take our orders. if youre an avid coffee drinker and youre in the area: ditch starbucks and go to dutch bros!
my husband and i stopped here before heading back home to ca. i had dutch bros. once in az  loved it, knew we just had to make a quick pit stop. it is open 24 hours which is a huge plus for all night coffee people like us. everything was just as good if not better at this location. i tried the iced annihilator and he had a dutch freeze caramelizor. both we sooo yummy and at 3 am, doing the trick for the long drive. the batista was very friendly and personable, we will be back the next time were in town.
awesome neighborhood pub. good beer. good food. good people. they have anderson valley summer solstice beer. refreshing on this hot summer day. try the brisket sliders  the quail egg was a nice touch. come visit katie  shes good people!
the place is nice and spacious.  fried pickled okra and fried oysters are good. nice assortment of meat  cheese.  the briskit sliders were good and juicy... our server katie is really wonderful. ..
just stopped in after the knights game to check out the vibe and grab a cocktail . . . super glad we did to have now become acquainted with this most welcome addition to the plzmdwd hood, nicely done!
in simple words  amazing. great bartenders and a fantastic addition to plaza midwood! i have heard their food menu is great and we look forward to trying it on our next visit!
the first impression was excellent. cool atmosphere and rustic design. great vibe, friendly and welcoming staff, and we were quickly seated even though it was busy. the food: the brisket sliders were delicious and cooked perfectly with pan seared cherry tomatoes, arugula,  and a quail egg on top though i dont know how irish. the fish and chips are a excellent go to for a quality dish. make sure to use the dipping sauce that comes with the chips, too. a manager came to our table to check in and ask how everything was. we will be back.
excellent, legit irish gastropub in plaza midwood. now, mind you, i only went there for drinks, but goddamn it left a great impression on me.first of all: you know all the crappy irish pubs around town? not this one  the workmans friend is straightup irish staffed. i think i heard an irish accent in about half the men and women behind the bar. second, the whiskey menu is quite extensive and theyve set aside a number of excellent irish whiskeys. thirdsies: theyve taken a cheeky approach to the irish pub setting and made the wallpaper look seriously scuffed up from all sorts of imagined bar brawls, makeout sessions, and general hullabaloo. i say its imagined because the place had only been open for a week when i got there. probably not enough time to wreck the place several times over... although, it is an irish bar in charlotte, so.....the menus irish gastropub fare looked quite good but my friends and i were just hanging before dinner elsewhere.anyway, its worth the checking out and it beats the hell out of a lot of other places in town  im looking forward to seeing what comes next at this place!
great atmosphere and awesome service! they were very patient with our large party. the brisket sliders and fried okra were amazing! great addition to plaza midwood and i cant wait to go back.
absolutely delicious! ordered brisket sliders, irish american grilled cheese and the burger. may have been the best ive had of everything....especially the burger. menu is not extensive, but it doesnt need to be. theyve nailed it.
theyve done a great job with the atmosphere; tricking your brain into thinking youve stepped into an old pub in ireland. the wait staff is friendly and patient; which is always a plus. the food options are no joke. after ordering a properly poured guinness and a shepards pie, its obvious they take great care with their food and drink. delicious. i will absolutely return.
the workmans friend in plaza midwood was fantastic. fried pickled okra and a mothers ruin cocktail to start. irish american grilled cheese and tomato bisque for the entree. finished up with an irish car bomb cupcake that impressed a gal who doesnt even like chocolate. definitely a new favorite place!
amazing service, from the hostesses to the servers, and the food is spectacular! the fish and chips is some of the best ive ever had. lovely, authentic, and comfortable place.
love everything about this place! the service and food is fantastic and i love the atmosphere! will definitely be back :
loved this place! i got the workmans burger and my friend got the fish and chips. the burger was great and he loved his meal, especially the peas! service was excellent, our waitress was super sweet and attentive. will definitely come here again!
a cross between a traditional irish pub and a modern restaurant. dimly lit with such music as the pogues playing lightly in the background. a lot of time and money has obviously gone into the interior of this establishment because it is very nice. this would be a great place to take the wife on a date or just hang out with friends. amazing staff. as soon as we walked in the door until the moment we left they were very welcoming and hospitable. great food and good beer selection. the back patio is very nice and enclosed. parking behind the building. they are quickly on their way to establishing themselves as a plaza midwood staple.
you have to try the beet and goat chz tower!
first visit. the place was well designed and laid out. we sat at the bar. food was great! got the mussels, pear salad, both on the menu, and the tostada brunch special. presentation was great, and food was delicious. dom our server was friendly and appropriately attentive. were definitely going back
went here last night and really loved the atmosphere. great food and drinks and the fireplace really added to the ambiance.
pretty darn good shepards pie, great drinks, great sides. good shadowy atmosphere like any true pub should be. long tables and benches add a cool communal vibe. get to know your neighbor!
great food started with the sausage rolls oysters and the mussels all of which were amazing! for dinner shepherds pie very good dish!
i had the open faced turkey. excellent chutney and apple pairing! the beer battered asparagus are really great as well.
at the risk of tooting their horn after one visit, im hooked. the fella and i stopped in right after work on a wednesday and grabbed a seat at the bar. the atmosphere was really cozy with dark wood, a fireplace at one end, and exposed brick, but we decided to make our way to the outdoor patio since nice evenings are few and far between.our service was awesome. the irish bartender was attentive, and our waitress was friendly, helpful with questions, and chatty but not too chatty. i loved the outdoor patio, which had apparently just gotten a fresh paint job and was still waiting on tvs, but did have a bar along with tables and stringy white lights. love.the fella got the shepherds pie because we were at an irish bar, and he loved it. he said it was warm and filling, and the lamb addition gave it just the needed kick. i got the openfaced turkey sandwhich, which was sweet and tasty. i also swapped out the chips that came with it for the roasted brussels sprouts. i had read some iffy reviews of the sprouts, but mine were great. they were actual, full brussels sprouts well, halved, but still instead of the chips some people referenced, and they werent too salty at all. i was in the clean plate club!prices were pretty reasonable, and this is definitely a place id love to come back in this winter just for the warm and cozy ambiance.
their burger is great! the garlic aioli is great on the fries. plenty of beer and a good atmosphere.
love this place!!! it frees like a true irish pub since the owner is from ireland. they have fabulous food, try the mussels, and they carry pickle back shots which is hard to find! they have a nice outdoor area and the bartender chris is the best ever! it is quite dark inside but thats very normal for an irish pub.
amazing place. excellent atmosphere. havent had anything yet that was not awesome workmans burger, roasted chicken, meat board, mac n cheese, asparagus, potato wedges. they have 3 desserts. the only one that is exceptional is the fruit crumble the cupcake is just ok  the ice cream is, well, ice cream. the drink prices are a bit high. service is friendly but not over bearing. this place is the best thing to hit charlotte since ive been here 25 years. my one suggestion: have recorded irish music at least one night a week and make it a regular night so i can be there! instead of current songs on the radio.
i say this in all honesty: i am astonished every single time i have the mac and cheese. seriously. it has ruined all other mac cheeses for me. the food, the irish coffees, the jameson...its all incredible.
wonderful staff. so friendly. can be noisy later in the evening but early is ideal. food rocks!
first time here last night and it was long overdue. went early around 5 pm as to miss the crowds, got a table on the patio and enjoyed a couple brews and some food. i got the chicken with asparagus and mac n cheese, and daaaamn. prob the best meal you can get for the price in the city. will def be back, this is a place i could see myself being a regular. cheers!
i have been going to nick for my piercings and i would never go to anyone else. ive had infected piercings, but not since i came to six16! he really cares about his customers health and well being and explains piercing care thoroughly, as well as addresses any questions or concerns promptly. the jewelry available for your piercings is beautiful, sustainable, from the best companies, and i get a lot of compliments on mine. i would absolutely recommend six16 to anyone looking for piercings or beautiful jewelry.
i stopped in to get dual vertical labret piercings. i absolutely love them and nick was patient with answering my questions. everything was clean and i wouldnt go anywhere else for any of my piercing needs. best place for piercings, hands down! thanks nick!
this is a very beautifully designed shop with a great jewelry selection from all very reputable manufacturers.  nick is highly skilled and will definitely be able to accommodate you with any piercing youre looking for at a very fair price.  i would definitely suggest checking out this shop if youre looking for a clean, safely done piercing done by a knowledgeable, welltrained practitioner.
six16 offers a nice selection of body jewelry and body piercing services in a clean and professional environment.i dont look like the average pierced customer, but i am always treated with the same professionalism and respect as the heavilypierced clientele  which appreciated.the store has a quiet and minimal quality. it is easy to browse the merchandise and ask questions.
six 16 formerly artisan body piercing is the best place to go in pittsburgh for safe, friendly, professional services as well as amazing and highquality jewelry. nick offers the best selection in town. if he doesnt have it in stock he is incredibly helpful and patient in getting you what you want ordered. he has done several of my piercings and i plan to get all future work done by him as well. his game is at a whole other level. i cant recommend him strongly enough. hes incredibly knowledgeable and skilled. i guarantee youll have a great experience with him and walk out feeling fahncee as duck.
i had to redownload yelp so i could give a review. i had the most amazing experience at six16. i went in very nervous and still on the fence as to whether or not i wanted to get my septum pierced, but nick couldnt have been more calm and helpful. he answered all of my questions calmly and kindly, not once did i feel uncomfortable asking anything. he was extremely professional and walked me through every step of the piercing process and was very thorough explaining what to expect and aftercare. the facility itself was a great atmosphere and immaculately clean, and had a great selection of jewelry as well. im excited to head back and get some of that beautiful jewelry once my brand new septum piercing heals!
amazing experience. i had my septum pierced there today and cant say enough about how great this place is. the piercer is friendly he listened to me nervously babble for the entirety of the piercing, clean and very skilled. i have 6 other piercings and only one has been as smooth, painless and comfortable as my septum. as long as im in pittsburgh i wont be going anywhere else for piercings.
i came here today after i had a lot of pain with two of my piercings done at another shop. he was professional, respectful and nice about advice in regards to my piercings. ill be excited to return after my ear heals.
got my septum pierced today! awesome environment and professional atmosphere thanks!!!
a great experience overall; friendly, clean, fast and simple.  would totally recommend it to anyone looking to get a piercing.
i stopped in here on a whim to get a piercing done.  i havent had anything but my ears pierced in first grade, but nick made me feel totally comfortable and answered all of my questions thoroughly.  he explained the sanitation process as he did it, which gave me confidence that i wont get any infections.
family owned....used to be an orangeleaf but now is this great place for yogurt.  get as much or as little as you want, top with fixings and weigh.  good to go.  variety of flavors to choose from.  try it out!  love it.  even has sugar free options!
rebbecca is so great with her customer service . the pumpkin yogurt was amazing .love coming here .
this truck has some of the freshest ingredients and their wraps and bowls explode with flavor... im literally drooling thinking about the mongolian style wrap with the most tender juicy steak. not to mention the wonchos fried wonton style nachos are something out of this world. if you get your wrap in a bowl, i would recommend grabbing a side of fried wontons to scoop up that goodness. also i grabbed a wrap from them one night, and had a couple of hours before i could eat it torture but after being in the fridge it held up so well i swear it tasted even better. theyre definitely doing something right.
love getting new wrap order for lunch. they have a decent variety of wrapsor bowls and their ingredients dont taste processed or stale. great value considering how much you get form a food truck typically. known for the sauces for a reason.
no complaints. first time coming here may 30, 2015. it was a slow friday or saturday afternoon. clean, quiet, pricy but its worth. restroom clean. paid 120 for two people .....dessert! the bomb
phenominal food, great staff, when i left the button green side up i was not disappointed!! ill be eating there again!!
ive come to this place several times, and each time the service is spectacular.  even recently, when ive become gluten and soy intolerant, the manager offered to walk me through the salad bar and pointed out all things that i should avoid.  he was extremely knowledgeable, and i appreciated his kindness.  all that aside...the salad bar selection is terrific.  be prepared to make more than one trip.  love the smoked salmon!  the steak is plentiful, and if it isnt cooked to your liking, you can make requests and theyre back in a flash with your preference.  the house cut is my fav!  i recommend reservations, as this place is always slammed.
excellent service and excellent food.  will return next time in vegas.  had been to texas de brazil in dallas, and really enjoyed the experience. thankfully, the one in vegas did not disappoint.  me and my wife were able to use the bus system to get to town square and walked to the restaurant
hands down the best brazilian steakhouse in the west but a bit pricy. try the sirloin strip which is very tasty or the bacon wrap chicken breast for flavor wilder than the west. however, save your tummy for the filet mignon because it will make other steaks taste like cardboard but hey, if you want the best then save room for it. the salad bar are amazing because its a meal by itself. go ahead and try this place because you will wish why did your eat at other brazilian steakhouse. its a both a meatatarian and vegetarian paradise for either party.
let me start by saying im not a big meat person but i have always wanted to try this place. all you can eat meats, who wouldnt. the variety of meats they offer varies from pork, steaks, chicken and lamb. we were able to experience so many types of meats, cuts and flavors. the filet mignon was extremely tender, lamb chops with mint sauce full of flavor, bacon wrapped chicken definite delight, pork sausage cooked just right and the variety of extra sides at the salad bar was an overload of goodness. our server amanda was amazing as well. she was attentive, personable and when we requested a certain meat she was quick to have it sent to our table. she was so polite, for instance she would ask permission to pour more sangria instead of just assuming we wanted more. she also used a splashguard while pouring. now i know thats a standard in most restaurants but not followed all the time. her recommendations were well taken.favorites: lamb chops, shrimp salad and filet.
as a lenient pescetarian, texas de brazil may seem contra proferentem, but that doesnt deter any semblance of review to be given. a solid five stars, teetering on the border of four and a half because i aspire for the rankings of michael kors, this establishment combines the diadem of service etiquette with an affluent diversity of cuisine, fulfilling both the hedonistic propensity of meat lovers and a conscience for the vegetarian diet. lets talk about the controversial matter peppered with bon mots  pricing is fifty for those who identify as indominus and half for those who get asked if you were stranded on an island, would you eat coconut palms or a cow, as if an organism exists in such ecology. this is las vegas. if youre pooling sweat over these rates, you might want to get a refund for that threestep easy online degree in geography and start your career in anthropomorphic fursuit construction. you have come to this city in a premediated agenda: to market yourself as some uberchic cliche, recreate the events of the hangover through an arrangement of poorly taken snapchats, or maybe to meet someone with silicon implants for the first time; but, most of all, to drop a wallet like beyonce drops an album out of nowhere. so, yes, you can swipe your card with impunity. dont act like you havent fed the slot machines your latest paycheck. theres no judgement here.normally, im against the american restaurant normative that will slaughter anything that walks on at least two legs  im sure youve read upton sinclair before  but unlike your typical factory chain, texas de brazil stands proud with a classy ambiance and setting. a giant chandelier, seen in the old hollywood silent noir; the qualities of a winehouse combined with an exclusive air of upperclass; a secretive bathroom, whose sinks are the definition of pretentious  theyre like vases. it makes olive garden look like a pathetic hole in the wall, so this ambiance is part of the price youre paying. after all, i bet their electric bill has two commas. now, i wont be shoving words into the mouthes of the carnivores because i know for a fact that theyll be shoving in slabs after slabs of thick, juicy meat. talk about umami  you can let it sit in your mouth and enjoy the flavor as the meat keeps coming and coming. for those who need a basic rundown of the protocol, ill do you a solid: servers, with huge, thick, long, wellcooked, and lathered sticks of meat will walk by you and ask if you want a piece. ooh la la. swipe right on everything but the parmesan chicken  ive heard its salty in flavor, but to each their own taste, am i right? now, if youre giving up after your second cut, the secret 411 is that some drone will abduct you and drop you off to a detox center where youll realize how much money and meat youve wasted. after all, area 51 is close by. the servers are relentless and will stop at nothing to make sure youve gotten your fill. to illustrate this phenomena, our large party of around twenty five followed the family tradition of prayer  we have to be grateful, obvi. as ive learned in screenwriting 101, subtext is everything. and as we harmoniously prayed about the lamb of god, servers brought freshly cooked lamb to the table.to discuss the politics of omnivores yet evade vegetarians is offensive in every right. the coined term salad bar does not do justice to what is provided. yes, there is salads  in about three to four different variations; carbohydrates in all of their glory; seafood; and whatever else you want, they probably have it. cool beans, right? a temperate ambiance, relative position to the las vegas scene, service, and the food combines to make a five star experience in texas de brazil. as a pescetarian, i firmly vouch for this restaurant.
one of my favourite restaurants! my boyfriend and i absolutely adore texas de brazil. we first came here for our anniversary after getting a recommendation from my older brother. a lot of our mutual friends agreed that this place was the bomb diggity. the wait staff is very attentive. they fold your napkins when you are away from the table and are super on top of drinks. all the food is delicious and there really isnt anything to complain about. tips and tricks: i would suggest going to lunch rather than dinner. dinner price is 50 dollars and lunch is 30. the only difference is that lunch doesnt include sushi, heart of palm, and buffalo mozzarella at the salad bar. i love the heart of palm and mozzarella but id rather have a cheaper bill. lunch is also a lot more laid back than dinner. not that fancy is a bad thing! its just what you are in the mood for that day, i suppose. my favourites include the fried bananas, lamb chops, and brazilian sodas.  i would also suggest getting a dessert, specifically the cheesecake. while its not included in the meal, its definitely worth the extra charge. and if you get the lunch with a desert, its still cheaper than the dinner charge! ;dalso! make a reservation. this place gets pretty packed.
you have to try this place out!! the best quality meats you can only imagine, you will not regrets coming over here, the lamb is the best lamb ive ever had, the service is good, they come around consistently with the different meats to offer, i would say the only down side would be that they dont have free refills. but the water is of great quality too.
ive eaten at various brazilian steakhouse before. im a big fan of red meats.. and i have to say.. this place.. hands down is the best. the servie, the meats, the salad bar.. it was all delicious and fabulous!
my aunt made the reservation to this place. it was packed, but once i sat down i understood why. the food was delicious. it is buffet style, so we definitely got our moneys worth. were from california so i was not expecting the meat to be served to us on giant sticks,fresh off the grill. they literally cut the piece of meat you would like onto your plate. it was an interesting type of buffet!the filet mignon and house sirloin were definitely my favorites of the night! also their grapes covered in blue cheese and mayo were surprisingly delicious! the only thing i was disappointed in was the chicken. i didnt really enjoy the flavor of the chicken. it tasted dry at times compared to the beef! i couldnt stop eating the red meat! even when i was fulljust eating for the taste! everyone was so friendly and richie our server was definitely the best. 5stars for customer service!overall very good experience! too bad they dont have one in california!
celebrated my husbands birthday here. service was great, food is awesome, and the desserts are to die for. keep in mind the drinks and dessert is separate, but you get all you can eat meat and salad with the sides.
why go:  because you love amazing brazilian bbq and arent afraid to pay for it.  what did i put in my mouth:while there was great variety in the meats and cuts, i enjoyed the house special, picanha, and garlic picanha.  the alcatra was on par as well.  sides are buffet style such as sauteed mushrooms, lobster bisque, salad bar, or jasmine rice.  complimentary garlic mashed potatoes and cheese bread was equally tasty and welcome.  if it wasnt for arias buffet that we ate 6 hours earlier, im sure we would have put more of the meat down.  what did it cost:its not hometown buffet so expect to pay some .  it was around 50 mark but for the quality and quantity of food, it is well worth it.  play hard, eat hard.  how was the service:lola was on point.  a hallmark of any good server is water never dips below half for too long and we are checked on if we are enjoying ourselves.  the servers with the meat skewers were fast to the table and variety abounds.  this is one of those places that i say i would go to more if it were closer but thats all bs.  its a special little spot that is reserved when i can make it to vegas because its not in california.  i love fogo, but this place edges it out.  while the buffets in vegas are great, theres really nothing quite like exceptional rodizio.....trust me when i say you wont disappointed....
amazing !!!! i cant rave enough about this place ...im only disappointed there isnt one back home in los angeles. we have a pretty popular churrascaria here but i can honestly say i prefer texas de brazil. the choices are bountiful and not to mention delishes. the feijoada is always perfect and their plantains are just heaven sent. i dont even like my own cooked plantains anymore because texas de brazil ruined that for me lol.  plus dont get me started on the pão de queijo cheese bread aka small puff balls of pure bliss in your mouth.....without sounding like a complete pig ...anymore.....i would gladly share them with you if we were sitting at the table together ...they bring more if you run out : oh happy day, more carbs!!!  point of my yelp is....... just do it.... go big.... or go home!  i know real brazilian churrascaria and this place is incrível!!!!
the service was just perfect. i had just the salad bar and it was a vegetarians dream. !we went for my husbands birthday and he was in meat heaven ...  we love this place. let me say again...service was perfect !!! make sure to sign up online for abirthday surprise.
i went for my birthday and the food was great and the sever was great mathew did a great job. very happy with the service i will definitely come back.
i was apprehensive to go here, we wanted to go to fogo de chao, but they didnt serve lunch on the weekend.  was pleasantly surprised though.  very nice, modern decor.  very friendly service, and quality of food was very good.  meats may be slightly less flavorful than fdc, but still good.  house special meat really great, very good options at the salad bar.  we also got free dessert which they dont offer at fdc, but think thats only on the weekend.way better than the casino buffet scene, definitely recommend.
i won a gift card for texas de brazil at our company christmas party, i wasnt too excited about it but my husband was. i was pleasantly surprised. as someone who isnt a huge meat eater i headed to the salad bar and i loved all the options. everything i tried was delicious! i especially loved the lobster bisque. my big surprise was at how much i enjoyed the meat, so good! better than other high end steakhouses weve tried. my husband was in heaven, and by the end i was so full i thought i might die. lol our waiter, richie was amazing and we will request his section when we return.
took my dad for his birthday here since hes never been and since hes a major carnivore; definitely had to put my vegetarian on the side today for my dad lol. located in the town square shopping center and across from look style society, very easy to get to and has its own parking spot.there was a bit of a wait, not too long, about 20 minutes on friday, labor day weekend so thats pretty good. but i made reservations earlier for 8pm, which i think is the best way to go.came here for dinner at 49.99person which included unlimited salad bar and unlimited meats! the salad bar had tons of options! my favorites were the lobster bisque of course, and the potatoes gratin. i also saw a variety of cheeses, deli meats, curried cauliflower, all types of salads with quinoa, beans, and your typical toppings with romaine lettuce, grilled veggies, mushrooms, smoked salmon, shrimp, breads, etc. pretty amazing but dont get too filled up on all of that since at your table you get unlimited meats coming around!if youve never been here, they have little coasters on the table, one per person, with one side green and one side red. if you want meat, you flip it to the green side, and if you need a little break or if youve decided to throw in the towel, you flip it to the red side! when its green, they have servers that walk by your table, each with a large skewers of a different style of meat and you tell them how many pieces your want! the options from what i can remember were filet mignon, top sirloin the infamous picanha the fave at our table, lambs chop, parmesan porkchicken, bacon wrapped filet, pork ribs, flank steak, and brazilian sausage! phew! tons of meat options!then if youre still not full, or if you suddenly get a second stomach like me right when dessert comes, they have a lot of great options as well! brazilian cheesecake, creme brulee, brazilian flan, chocolate mousse cake, bananas foster pie, key lime pie, carrot cake, pecan pie, brazilian papaya cream, and coconut pie. they brought the dessert tray out and i wanted to try basically everything especially the creme brulee, flan, and papaya cream but decided to go with the carrot since its my dads favorite. so this carrot cake is pretty amazing. it doesnt have raisins in it and it has a coconut element to it so just that makes it an a in my book but on top of that it was super fluffy and moist and wasnt too sweet. i mean it was sweet definitely but it wasnt that artificial, loaded with powdered sugar type of sweetness. perfect way to end the meal! even though i dont eat meat often nowadays, on meat days, this is a definite contender especially if its a special occasion. yum! ill be back! in arnold voice lmao :
my favorite steak place in vegas! id spend every birthday here if i could! my favorites are the sirloin and bacon wrapped filet mignon!
i love this place!! this isnt my first time here, but it was for my husband. we went today for our wedding anniversary and he really liked it. the food selections are broad and the service is excellent. very mellow ambiance here. depending on your budget, it can be kind of pricey 50pp for dinner, but its more of a special occasion type of place, imo. overall, definitely plan to return again in the future.
excellent! awesome! great food! service on point!!!!!!!!!! highly recomended!!!!!!!! the accommodations they went through for my baby girls wedding reception!!! nothing but a big thank you!!!!
simply delicious. i took my wife out on a date in vegas for the last couple of hours we were in town. we chose texas de  brazil because we like steakhouses. everywhere we go, we usually get a steakhouse in there somewhere. our experience in texas de brazil was phenomenal. the salad bar was really good.. but trust me, you go for the meat. my wife kept eating the beans feijoada and she normally doesnt eat beans at all. the service was also really nice.. we had our luggage with us and they kept it aside while we were in the restaurant. overall great experience. not overpriced either.
we came here to celebrate our one year engagement anniversary and even though it was a little pricey it was worth every penny!  since it was a monday there wasnt much of a wait.  by the time i returned from using the restroom our table was ready.  i didnt particularly like the seating as it was right behind the host station but for being seated that quickly and being very hungry i let it slide.  next time ill ask for a seat in the back. the only real negative i have us that the entryexit doors are extremely heavy.  if thats the worst thing about a place in my book thats easily 5 stars.  we started out with the salad bar and a few of my favorite things were the goat cheese,  green beans and au gratin potatoes.  i also really enjoyed the potato salad which is not something im usually fond of.  the meats!  oh the meats!  i tried chicken wrapped in bacon,  chicken parmesian, filet wrapped in bacon,  sirloin steak,  flank steak and sausage.  everything was delicious.  the sausage has a slight kick to it which was a nice change of pace. the filet wrapped in bacon was a little on the salty side but that didnt stop me from finishing it.  the flank steak and sirloin steak were melt in your mouth delicious.  the chicken options were good but im more of a red meat person so they dont really stand out as im writing this. we were stuffed full and asking for the check when our server sue gave us comment cards and mentioned future discounts of course we took the bait. i found this practice slightly odd for what seemed to be an upscale place.  i asked if we were able to get any discounts this time because we were celebrating our engagement anniversary and she offered us the cheesecake and even wrapped it to go for us.  the service was excellent,  the food was excellent because of the price this would be more of a special occasion restaurant but i do see us going back.
this is, by far, my favorite restaurant...who am i kidding, its my favorite place, restaurant or otherwise!! i cant even tell you how many times ive been here. usually, in march, they offer a vip dining card, which is 60 for 12 meals at half off. although i passed this year, its still worth the full price.this is my wifes and my goto place for special occasions. we had our first date at tdb. the event manager, monique, and one of the gms helped me plan my extravagant marriage proposal at tdb. and now, my wife and i returned after our wedding a couple weeks ago. they always treat us great, and the food is phenomenal.i could go on about the food for days, but the experience can be neatly summarized as an allyoucaneat, gourmet meat buffet that comes to you! whether you like filet mignon, sirloin, flank, or ribs, ir pork, or lamb, or sausage...tdb is a meateaters heaven on earth. dont forget the incredible salad bar, the best in town everything from prosciutto, to sushi, to palm hearts and cous cous, lobster bisque, shrimp...the list goes on. careful though...dont pull the rookie mistake of filling up on the salad bar...or the delicious cheesy bread balls at the table. save room for lots of fried bananas with cinnamon and sugar free at the table, and the dessert options are insanely good too.thank you, tdb, for always providing everything i could ever want in a meal!
im not a big meat person but this place made me change my mind! i had just about every meat they offered and everything was amazing! all the food was flavorful and the meat was tender. the filet mignon was by far my favorite.
my favorite brazilian steakhouse in vegas. salad bar and hot food items are just as good as the churascarria. my favorite cuts are the garlic sirloin, picanha, and tritip. servers also offer medium rare cuts which i prefer over medium. my past 3 trips to vegas have involved coming here for dinner and it never gets old or repetitive for me.
i walked in with reservations and was seated quickly. i was greeted by some of the friendliest faces ive seen in town.  the restaurant was bustling with people and the bar area was full with nfl football fans. the food was delicious and everything was so fresh. i loved the variety of items at the salad and hot food bars. i really appreciated the fact that everything was always being replenished. the two ladies who were our servers were so sweet. they made some really great suggestions. i loved the beef ribs. when i couldnt find them anymore i was devastated. but to my rescue, my server was able to ask some fine gentlemen to bring some over for our table. that was fantastic!! i swear, those beef ribs are life changingly delicious. i couldnt imagine how in the world i was going to be able to consume my 50 worth of meat and sides but i noticed that if you sign up for their email based club online, before your visit, you will receive a 25 off coupon. i know, for a fact, that i would not be dining here too often if anytime real soon. so, i signed up and thought that it would be the perfect opportunity to use that voucher for my meal. so, i ended up paying about 25 for my dinner, before taxes, drinks, tip, etc. that was definitely helpful in making it feel more affordable.
so coming from a small island, ive never had the opportunity to partake in brazilian food. but my oh my, im so glad i came here. this is an all you can eat meat place. they have this huge salad bar that consists of veggies, bread, cold meats, soup of the day, hot starch, and cheese. our server was a very friendly lady, sorry forgot to ask her her name, who always made sure we were doing alright. the men that came around with the meat on the stick were really friendly, and even if we didnt have our card flipped they would ask us if we wanted more meat.  the meal includes bottomless nonalcoholic drinks and a dessert of your choosing.now lets talk about meat. im personally a girl who loves her salt, species, and rare to med rare meat. also ive been to my share of steakhouses that for the most part dont impress me. but this meat actually met my standards. my favorites were the brazilian picanha, brazilian alcatra, and lamb chops. these meats were tender, moist, tasty, and actually medium rare.overall i really like this place, and think the rest of my family would enjoy this too. cant wait to eat here again when i visit vegas next time!
this place is great! my friend mentioned a place where we they serve meat at your table and an all you can eat salad bar. why would you want to eat dinner anywhere else? its accommodating that its 50 bucks a person but all the sizzling meat sirloin, prime, chicken, medium rare, rare its so worth it! the minute i walked in the hostess was really friendly and i liked how she sparked up a conversation. the setting looked really nice and fancy. interior felt like a brazilian getaway vacation. the waiters and waitresses were all sharp buttoned up flannels and all. the waitress quickly greeted us saying there are more than 60 choices in the salad buffet and did i mention that they have shrimp and salmon in the salad bar? yes i said it!the minute youve stepped in here you can smell the marinated steak turning in the kitchen.the meat just melts in your mouth and seasoned just the way i like it. definitely bringing my appetite back!
everything about my experience at texas de brazil was awesome. their restaurant is really well laid out an acoustically very nice. the one thing i would say is that if youre going to go for dinner make sure you go on an empty stomach because there are no doggie bags although you will want to take some food home with you. from the filet mignon wrapped in bacon to the top sirloin or the chicken wrapped in bacon  all of the meats were incredible and totally worth going for the. the salad bar was excellent as well i got a lot of olives with the mini corns  those are too funny. carlos was our server and he made sure that we always had a clean plate or our drinks were topped off. the entire experience was 5 stars and if i wanted to eat that much every day or spend 50 a meal... this would be the spot!
always a goto when we want a nice family dinner for a special occasion! this time we needed to use up the last of our vip discount card! every single part of this dining experience is my favorite! definitely dont go if youve had a big lunch!!
great meats, excellent salad bar, cooperative wait staff, nuff said, would love to back again.
not a meat eater and found everything too much items to enjoy including the smoked salmon from their bar just phenomenal! the little red peppers are too real good and just thinking about the smash potatoes and fried plantains makes my mouth water.really the best place to enjoy with families. i am coming back and back and back until the ends of time. go. you wont regret it.
best restaurant ive ever been to and gone several times you just cant stop eating the awesome meat
i live in los angeles but come to vegas at least three times a year and every time i come i make sure to eat at texas de brazil. if you love steak and good food then this place is a must! beautiful restaurant with a professional staff that makes you feel like vip. the salad bar alone is worth the trip but save room for all that steak and dessert. oh and if you like men in uniform...yea, you want to be here : great eye candy best restaurant in town for sure!
this place is a must go to whenever were in vegas. the salad bar alone could be an excellent meal, especially for people not into steakmeat. all the meat is good but favorites are short rib, sirloin, filet mignon.
this was a great night.  delicious food, great service, great atmosphere.  i took my university student athlete and roommate for dinner.  these kids can eat, and they were in heaven with all the protein you can eat.  they loved the huge cheesecake as well.  good for special ocassion, business dinner or just night our when you are hungry.  ill  be back
you have to come when you are really hungry best time.we did not eat breakfast, lunch. our plane landed at 2 pm and made at the restaurant 5pm.took a cab.it was great everything i have tried was great. the salad bar was the best i ever had. wait for the lamb chops. will definitely be back when i am in town.
for the past few years i have eaten here at least 810 times. usually on special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries. ive also eaten here for lunch. every time has been very pleasant and have always left happy and full.   the salad bar has a great selection of sides ranging from seasoned cheeses to smoke salmon. its always hard not to go a little overboard on the salad bar since they offer a great variety. soups have always been good and they always offer between 45 kinds. on to the meats.   if you are looking for a specific meat your waiterwaitress will ask if there is a meat your looking for. just let them know and eventually one of the servers will come by. if you are a fast eater just let the servers know you would like another serving. serving size seems small but you have to remember you are being served pork, chicken, beef, and lamb. ive always been happy with the meats they served, never finding them too salty and they have never arrived dry.   if the price for dinner is too much for you i suggest trying them during lunch look at the website to see when they are open for lunch. definitely not as busy compared to dinner time and they seem to offer the same meats. i think its great they are open for lunch because afterwards a walk or waddle to town square is needed after such a great big meal.
i live in los angeles but come to vegas at least three times a year and every time i come i make sure to eat at texas de brazil. if you love steak and good food then this place is a must! beautiful restaurant with a professional staff that makes you feel like vip. the salad bar alone is worth the trip but save room for all that steak and dessert. oh and if you like men in uniform...yea, you want to be here : great eye candy best restaurant in town for sure!
i cant even express how much i enjoyed it here. the service is stellar, the salad bar amazing! omg the meats are beyond awesome. i could come here every night! best meal ever!
best place by far for the meat lover!!!
we dined here on thursday and i had absolutely no complaints about texas de brazil. we had reservations for 8 oclock and we waited about five minutes to be seated. as far as everything else from the service to the food, it was all great!
i have been here close to a dozen times and every time i leave here i have a huge smile on my face!  the customer service is fantastic and the food is even better!!!!!  the garlic sirloin is my absolute favorite and the smoked salmon from the salad is absolute heaven!!  do yourself a favor and stop by texas de brazil!!!!
everything was wonderful. i took my family here for dinner. they have not stopping raving about it. the food was incredible. the service was excellent. we will be back! loved the lamb!!
i had the chance to eat here during a company national meeting. in the 25 years of eating out during meetings this was the very best. service is fantastic, the meat is off the hook great and the salad bar has everything you could want!
first time at a brazilian restaurant. server marcos was outstanding, we never sat with an empty drink. the food was literally some of the best ive ever had. a little pricey, but well worth it. everyone we encountered was friendly.
i have been here about five times, never disappoints. meat is always spot on. servers are great. upscale feel to the place. salad bar is too good in my opinion, i eat too damm much from it and then i cant fill up on meats. the cheese bread balls are delectable. the cheesey potatoes at salad.bar are au gratin delicioso. a little pricey, but for that special occasion or when you want to be a carnivore this is the place. my favorites were the flank steak, and bacon wrapped filet mignon.
this was my second time here and again it was excellent!! we were in las vegas for a week and had planned on going on veterans day but 2 days before i get an email saying that they will run the 50 off special the entire week! not only that but they will give 50 the entire table up to 8 guest not only the veteran. i was super excited as my friend was in town that night and would not be here on veterans day. we changed our plans and took our friend. we all really enjoyed ourselves. my husbands favorite was the leg of lamb and my favorite was the house special. cindy really enjoyed the lobster bisque. cant wait to go back. really wish we had a texas de brazil in hawaii.
salad bar was amazing !!! along with all the delicious meat. great atmosphere ..loved it
the question is should i take my friends to this establishment for a dining experience? and will they want to take their friends when they come to town next time? the answer is yes. and yes. this place has energy. the people working here have good chemistry. the wait for our table is acceptable even for a holiday weekend. the food smells good. the meat passed my chewing test. i didnt get tired chewing. simple. salt and sugar level is ok for me. everyone has a different scale for that so you make up your own mind. fresh ingredients at the salad bar. you will leave here with a full stomach. your choice. the alcoholic cocktail drink is strong. takeaway. ask for more fried banana. eat it like a dessert.
this is my go to spot when my steak cravings flare up. i love steakhouses, but sometimes a craving needs to be satisfied with excessive amounts of red meat. my first tip is to eat here for lunch or brunch on a weekend. its cheaper than dinner and having been here for dinner i cant find a difference in the foods offered. the salad bar is good enough to make a meal. that is coming from a meat fan. the salad bar has much more than the average salad bar. it includes smoked salmon, assorted cheeses, several veggie salads, fruit salads, lobster bisque, and sushi. i also find it hard to resist filling up on just the salad bar. before the meal the server will bring out plantains, mashed potatoes, and cheddar biscuits. all of the above are delicious and yet another temptation i have to resist before the meat arrives. the plantains are my favorite! the first time i came here i thought that the meat would be abundant, but mediocre quality. i was completely wrong. the meats are actually delicious and well seasoned. the variety should please all tastes too. they offer parmesan chicken, several cuts of steak, lamb, and sausage. the steaks are my favorite meats. the service is very attentive. someone is always at the table offering meat or refilling drinks. the servers are always really good about getting certain meats to the table if you have a preference. on one visit my husband ordered a cocktail that he didnt care for, nothing was wrong with the drink. our waitress noticed he didnt drink it and insisted on taking the drink off of the bill. we never expected this or asked her to do this, but that to me is great service.meat!
weve been to fogo de chao and wanted to try a different place, so we came here for our first dinner in vegas. this place was outstanding. service was impeccable, and from the minute we sat down, meat was coming at us. all of it was a perfect medium rate, all of it perfectly seasoned. i love at these types of places how the servers learn to know what you like and what you dont, so thats what they bring around for you. we didnt try the salad bar because, well, why would we? . im there for meat!!!!  we did, however, leave room for dessert. we selected a beautiful citrus vanilla creme brulee. oh my...it was heaven. definitely will visit again. we will at least try the one thats about 1 12 hours from our home. excellent. come hungry and enjoy!
a must try for a brazilian steakhouse. we have tried other brazilian steakhouses and have looked at other spreads but we always find ourselves back here. weve also brought visitors here and never had any conplaints.great service, great selection and delicious food. we love the filet mignon and the beef ribs. reservations recommended.
amazing food!! this is a treat to your taste buds for sure. if you are in vegas you owe it to yourself to visit this place, be sure to come hungry because they truly dont stop bringing the flavor until you ask them to stop. a cut above in freshness and variety to satisfy anyone. deserts are on par as well all around flavor explosion defiantly would recomend. i would suggest reservations as you can make them online as this place stays quite busy
went this past monday and the food was excellant.  the server sonny and the manager edson were very friendly and provided excellant service.  the house picana is my favorite.  check it out.
i love churrasco.  i love this place.  the problem i always have is that i tend to fill up on the salad bar a misnomer if ever there was one before the carnivore kicks in.the salad bar is more an antipasti bar: salumi, cheeses, roasted and pickled vegetables, and a lobster bisque that will have you wanting it iv.  oh, and there are salads as well.the meats are roasted perfectly, and theres plenty to go around.  i am a fan of lamb, and when they come out with not only roast leg but also chops, im in heaven.i just wish i or im glad i dont live closer.  its in the town square, and i live in sunrise manor, so its a 45 minute drive; but its well worth the drive.
industrial chic new coffee shop offering great java drinks and even better aussie style pasties
a little hard to find, but totally worth it. my wife happened upon this place at the suggestion of a friend and thought wed give it a try. simply outstanding coffee. probably the best latte ive had in years. you dont realize going to starbucks everyday what really good coffee is suppose to taste like!
welcome to the family maverick!they serve ritual coffee on pour over and espresso and offer tea and smoothie options as well. for food, they have delicious savory pies and a couple of all day breakfast options i have yet to try.they have a gorgeous open space with very well thought out seating  a great balance of tables, chairs and couches for you to settle in however you like. baristas are friendly and knowledgable and can make a proper flat whitepiccolo.being the aussie inspired cafe and featuring a phenomenal roaster that hasnt been offered in phoenix before makes maverick a wonderful, unique addition to the phoenix specialty coffee scene. ive been in 3 times in the 3 weeks theyve been open and have seen the cafe get busier and busier. while it was quiet and not so busy a couple of weeks before, the space is now buzzing with chatter and has a great social feel to it. maverick is definitely in my top 5 cafes in phoenix alongside cartel, press, giant and peixoto.
i consider myself the coffee shop review guy as i love visiting coffee shops and trying their specialities.  today, i came across mavericks which is a little hidden away off scottsdale rd and  shea in the center of the strip mall, but if you find them, you will not be disappointed.first of all the the place had music going, but yet quit enough you can think, or have a conversation with someone.  the acoustics were also well thought out as you do not hear all the conversations of people around you, unless they are yelling.  you do get to hear the espresso machine in the background which is comforting to my ears. :the staff greeted me as soon as i walked through the door and made me feel comfortable and took the time to educate me on the menu and their specialities.  it was nice to see a coffee shop that had professional looking employees that were having valued their clients.ok, so what about the coffee?  i ordered a cappuccino and a berry tart see picture and sat down which i usually do to see if they will bring me the drink or i have to go get it.  i was surprised that they actually found me and delivered the coffee to me.  the cappuccino was just the right temperature as i latter found out their machine is from italy and uses four stages to brew the shots verses the one stage found in many coffee shops.  i appreciated the fact that the cappuccino was very smooth and had no taste or aroma of burnt beans.  i also appreciate the swan design on top.now what about the tart.  yummy yummy yummy.  their pastries are not the run of the mill stuff you expect to see in a coffee shop. the other thing i liked is everyone left me alone and minded their own business and let me enjoy my cappuccino and do my work. so, on this one, i will give them 5 stars and recommend those that are following me to give them a try.  make sure to let me know your experience!i will do a followup review in a couple of months once things settle in and see how they do then.  but i will be back tomorrow friday 71015 as they are having free coffee and tea day. :the coffee review guy  jim kreisman
usually cold brew coffee is very astringent.   thier cold brew was light and refreshing  kind of tea like.   very cool decor and friendly staff.
had a chemex and it was good, had an espresso and it was excellent. i will be going back to this very cool coffee shop. they actually care about coffee and take the time to do it right. my review is 5 stars because i believe they will continue to grow and become the best place in town. go buy a drink from them and enjoy something that supports local business and is done with excellence. they open at 7 not 6:30 like yelp says
this gem at scottsdale  shea is not to be missed! great rustic interior with a cold brew drip hanging from the ceiling!, lots of little comfy nooks to work in, a larger meeting room in the back, great lighting and smart employees. the owner makes all of the pastries and pies  holy moly. ive had a hand pie there and the almond poppy seed muffin, and theyre both awesome. the tarts look incredible too. but libby! you say, this is a coffee shop! tell me about the coffee! oh friend, i will. the coffee is excellently crafted by very talented baristas. they serve and sell ritual coffee, a top notch roaster. enjoy a chemex or a latte while youre there. not in the mood for coffee? their iced tea is to die for, especially the white tea. definitely one to go check out!
friendly, knowledgable baristas.  great atmosphere for chilling out, reading, or getting work done.  and of course, most importantly, excellent coffee and drinks.  for my first visit, i had an americano and a bagel both of which were fantastic.  glad to have a new coffee hangout around!
great new coffee, tea and gathering place on scottsdale and shea. its got a great vibe to it. the place makes you feel cool when you walk in. im not a cool guy, but i feel like it when im there....but enough about me. the coffee is killer. ive had a few varieties and they all rock. today i had a chemex and it was incredible. the food is pretty great too. the hand pies, panini, and baked goods are tasty. they even have gluten free options! yea!  if you like coffee, you should definitely check it out. if you dont like coffee, it might be time to for you to try some. go to maverick, youll really appreciate it.
delicious chai latte, incredible pastries, very fast wifi 30mbps down when i tested it, and an incredibly convenient location make this new coffee shop an awesome place to hang out. i expect theyll get very popular when chaparral, the high school less than a mile away, starts up later this month
outstanding coffee, super friendly and handsome owners who are from australia and the u.k. the space is a bit hard to find at first but after a telephone call, i really wasnt very far at all.maverick serves ritual coffee from san francisco,ca. the space is very well furnished and lit with very comfortable and some industrial furniture. the pastries are very good and include several varieties including brownies, berry and peach tarts along with other food which looked very good and fresh however i did not have the chance to try them. the winner in my book is a plate called the olympian which consists of an egg souffle, two slices of bacon, cottage cheese, two pieces of toast, and tomato salad and an unbeatable value for  8.i wish maverick coffee much success in scottdale and look forward to my future visits
maverick coffee is the real deal. inviting atmosphere, welcoming staff and most importantly incredible coffee. im a cold brew fanatic and maverick does not disappoint. it looks like press coffee has come competition in town for best coffee shop! welcome to the neighborhood maverick, i hope youre here to stay.
mavericks coffee has amazing coffee and food. their service is great. if you are interested in what a true aussie cafe is like then this is it. most cafesrestaurants have either good food or good coffee but this place has it all. not to mention its super cute decor! defiantly a must see!
hands down wonderful coffee.we will be returning to try some of the food  expand our coffee horizons.we had the lattee  almond and vanilla we were going to just get one because we have gotten too expensive , not good coffee too many times before.i went back and ordered my own after i tried his.my daughter had a hot chocolate she was very pleased with as well.the staff was nice and professional.we will be back.
i agree with the review below, super friendly aussie guys who arent awful to look at that make delicious coffee and apparently have great tea. will definitely be back as i eyed the pastries and they also looked divine. great place to sit down and read or catch up with friends also. the location is kind of hidden, i guess the easiest way is to go east of the dairy queen that is right there near shea. theres a bunch of shops in the area.
absolutely love this place. only regret is that i didnt find it sooner. amazing ambience, even better coffee. best cappuccino ive ever had, and the cute foam art is a definite plus. the food is just as delicious. i could spend hours here everyday.
this place is very chill. courteous staff and lots of seating.  lets not forget delicious beans! will def be back!
great new place. theyre cold brew is spot on. pour overs are amazing. definitely a place to check out!
best iced chai tea latte ive ever had ive been searching for one thats consistently amazing and theirs never fails
wow. just got an iced almond latte with soy milk and upon first sip found it so delicious i had to stop writing my script to write a yelp review instead.great ambience comfy seating, spacious and quiet enough to get work done, intriguing food aussie meat pies at a coffee shop?? ill be here all day so will likely try one and easy parking. new favorite coffee shop in the phoenix area
another cool independent coffee shop in scottsdale!!!first and foremost  good espresso  good cappuccino  well executed  very tasty.cool people working there.got to come back and try the aussie meat pies  havent found a place with those and been missing them for almost 30 years.  beans from sf ritual.ill be back!
dont let the appearance of this strip mall fool you maverick coffee is a gem in a sea of scottsdales pretentiousness. i went there to work and loved the hightop tables with tall chairs.
had a great time and a good conversation with the barista. my iced chai was also great. good place that i will absolutely be ging back too.
came in on a weekday morning after reading a review in a local publication and was thoroughly impressed.  it is a place you could definitely hang out in and the staff was really friendly.  i just had a cup of coffee, which was terrific by the way, but the meat pies definitely caught my attention and ill definitely be going by to try those soon.
delicious coffee, cool furniture, friendly staff, and just an all over awesome vibe! new favorite coffee shop in centralnorth scottsdale. havent tried the food yet, but it looks good, too
wow i havent had very good cold brew around phoenix but this cold brew is awesome, not too acidic. kyoto cold brew is really good too, smokey flavor. friendly staff and they know their coffee
so far im loving it!i lived in sf for a couple of years, and they make damn good coffee over there. so whenever i see a local joint carrying an sf roast, i get so excited. brewing ritual coffee for ya.great location  as in this area needed something delicious! i hate starbucks and dutch bros, and that seems to dominate the north scottsdale area. plus, its on my drive to work, so ill definitely be stopping by often on my morning commute.friendly staff with great smiles, love the ambience, and in an area of town that desperately needed it.
i was getting my haircut in this hidden shopping center at scottsdale  shea and lo and behold i found a new coffee shop. the place is hidden in the middle of the shopping center with a nice big sign. very unassuming. i wasnt expecting much when i walked in but bang. it was like i walked nice comfy coffee shop with high tops and couches. very warm and welcoming. the people at the counter are very friendly and just love to talk about their coffee. anyways, i ordered the iced latte and my daughter got the iced brew. they we both really good and hit the spot on a really hot day. i thought that the coffee was a little more expensive than those other places but the ambience, friendliness,  and of course the coffee were great. now i got a go to place whenever i get my haircut. they also have food that just looked really good. really didnt focus on all those goodies but will have to try another time.
maverick noun:1. an unorthodox or independentminded person2. noncomformist; free thinkerso i am a little obsessed with the name of this coffee shop.  maverick is also my sons name.  when they first opened, i saw their signage on social media, and i bookmarked it immediately.  its a bit out of the way for me as im coming from the old town area, but its worth it...this adorable indie coffee shop is a bit hidden in the dq shopping center on the southeast corner of shea and scottsdale... the coffee is quality and the pastries look good, but i have yet to splurge on those.  its bright and colorful with comfortable seating, free wifi, electrical outlets, and friendly baristas too... happy hour is currently monday  thursday 3pm  7pm and they offer 2 coffee with a food purchase.  or, even more fun... catch them on fridays from 35 and beatthebarista in rock paper scissors to win a free coffee!its worth noting that they dont have a huge selection of food, but if you keep this in mind and go for the coffee and perhaps a sweet treat, youll be happy and caffeine buzzed too.
so glad that this little gem opened up not too far away from me! i appreciate a nice little coffee shop and loved this one. first off, if i was just relying on google maps to find it im pretty sure i wouldve gotten lost because it doesnt give very specific directions ha. it is in the strip mall type thing behind, cant see it from the street!one thing that made me happy in terms of how it looked was the teal accents. its my favorite color and seeing it everywhere instantly made me excited about maverick ha. the prices here arent too crazy which is rare, and good for the area! i noticed they have a veggie goat cheese sandwich, and i intend to try it another time. also the food they had on display looked awesome. some kind of cake covered in shredded coconut and chocolate, looked incredible!usually i go for tea, but i decided to change things up and got an iced mocha with almond milk. it always makes me happy when almond milk is an option. i got a small and it was plenty for me, but it did not cost much more to get a bigger size. sometimes mochas are too coffeeish and the flavor is too strong, but i really liked the mocha i had! not too sweet, not too milky, just right. my mom got an iced white tea and she loved it. i tried it and liked it too, was super refreshing, perfect for a hot day.maverick coffee is a great addition to all of the amazing restaurants in the scottsdale and shea area, glad i stopped in.
im from portland oregon, i am from the land of coffee perfected. no im not talking starbucks, gross. im talking local hand crafted coffee micro brews who arent commercialized and actually take pride in their coffee, and believe it should be an enjoyable experience.this place has it in spades. if youre looking for a great environment, incredible eats, and absurdly awesome coffee, youve got to plan on making a stop here.mavericks makes you feel like its 48 degrees and raining outside, even when its really 126  sunny. the customer service is beyond excellent, you can tell these guys take a ton of pride in their work  it comes through in their incredible coffee.i got the flat white,  i would recommended this to anyone who loves coffee.if i could give this place 10 stars i would. i will be a regular!
ive lived in arizona for almost two years now, and this place is by far the best in the valley!
theres a reason this little coffee joint has a solid five stars across dozens of reviews. im sitting in a comfy and clean retro love seat with a chemex gently steaming on the handmade table across from me as i write this review. its my first time here.the music is playing at the perfect volume for background and the shop is buzzing with plenty of energy and visitors without distracting me from my work. the coffee itself is delicious  right out of san francisco from what i understand ritual coffee.the vibe here is clean and bright and trendy with a touch of hipster just for me, i think. vintage edison bulbs everywhere. lots of wood and steel textures... right up my alley. plenty of seating without crowding the space  another huge plus.the service was great, too. the barista was happy to tell us all about the different types of beans available for us to choose from and obviously enthusiastic about the brand. tastylooking pastries beg for your attention at the front counter, too...been to many coffee shops within a 50 miles radius of this place, and i can say without a doubt that this will become a new goto spot for me. first time here today, but ill be back! if you havent been  go! youll love it.  :
just found out about this place and have been back twice this week! its a cute spot and its exactly what this part of town needs  a coffee shop with a trendy atmosphere and great cold brew. im so happy that i dont have to go to old town for cold brew anymore now that this place exists. i havent had a chance to try the food yet but im looking forward to it in the future. the atmosphere and decor is great, its quiet and spacious with lots of different types of seating. so far ive found it to be a great place to study. i hope they will be able to extend their hours on the weekend, i would love to be able to stay here later! it would also be neat if they showed local art instead of the stock stuff they have up currently, but overall 1010 for everything else. i highly recommend this place and see myself coming here frequently!
love the vibe,music and the coffee is awesome!
one of my favorite spots for coffee in arizona.
best coffee in the area......great food....great service....any chance i get i go in!!!
this is my new go to place! meetings, homework, work, hanging out, anything. the atmosphere here is amazing! it is very calm and relaxed not to mention they have outstanding coffee! some of the best ive found in north scottsdale. i wish they were open later! i love late night coffee shops but this place for sure rocks
really amazing cappuccino and friendlytalkative staff!! highly recommended for coffee and a nice place to relax indoors.
maverick coffee is a hidden gem tucked away in a unassuming plaza, dont let its surroundings and exterior fool you! upon entering, i was surprised at how beautiful it was inside. yes, its a play on the industrialrustic as many other cafes have done before but maverick has done it in a way where the decor just makes sense and comes together.as always i always test shops based on how they do their lattes and needed to get some work in, the latter would let me get a feel of the place. the latte was smooth, creamy and just plain delicious. good amount of buzz from the coffee, love it! and that was just from a small. im a devout lux customer, but im sorry to say maverick blows lux out of the water. thanks aaron!i was interested in beans so i asked what they use in house and any recommendations. lydon told me they use rituals dark horse seasonal but recommended me rituals beans from costa rica due to my preferred method of brewing. he was definitely helpful and informative when choosing beans without feeling pressured to purchase anything. they also sell granola and a few coffee brewing items. ritual beans are from san francisco, california but it was my first time trying coffee from them being from the bay area and all ... and i thought they were well priced at 15 where beans usually got for 1820 elsewhere.the atmosphere itself is great, the volume isnt too loud or obnoxious, no pretentious vibe that you get at lux or cartel tempe and all in all its pretty comfortable. definitely would love to be back again whenever in the area, hoping maverick can make way to phoenix so i dont have to drive as far!
really, really, really good coffee! it definitely up there with cartel coffee for an excellent expresso in the valley. baristas were super friendly. plenty of sitting and outlets. nice conference room sized table and private room in the back. will be back.nice atmosphere, free wifi and did i mention the coffee is fabulous?!
thanks everyone for posting about this. great coffee and super nice staff  we chatted with john, the australian coowner and he was super friendly. my friend is from australia and im form new zealand  we are seriously fussy about coffee and this place rocks. great place to hang out.
new favorite coffee shop! really quality coffee and espresso. baristas are kind and friendly, which i think is hard to find. i love also that the coffee shop is clean, open layout and spacious...it doesnt feel crowded and when i have been there it has been quiet. i will definitely be back.
maverick is conveniently located right next to my salon, so ive been a frequent customer since they have opened. my boyfriend and i love the friendly and personable baristas as well as the cool laid back atmosphere. its not often you can find a place that has this vibe out side of downtown phoenix. the coffee is always delicious and we love trying the food as the menu grows!
best coffee shop in the world! dont miss out. great atmosphere to sit and try delicious coffee sourced from some of the best roasters in the country.  knowledgeable baristas who are happy to talk you through the different types of coffee on offer.
awesome independent coffee shop with a great vibe! perfect to do work and a lot less mainstream than starbucks. got the chai tea latte hot, was delicious!
just give it a try. i had a flat white and oh this was one of the smoothest coffee drinks ive ever had. if you like strong coffee maybe its not the best for you, but ive only had a drink with quite some milk! flat white so i wasnt able to tell the strength of it god it was so smooth tho. also had the manchego and fig panini and it was just right. i think its a must try spot!
great coffee  a real barista who can make a good flat white. not burnt or bitter, just right. it had been a long time since i have had a coffee that reminds me of home. think we have found our new fav place. food is good as well.
cool baristas, owner is rad, place is so neatly put together. love this is here in scottsdale.
my sister took me and my 3 girls to this nail salon and when we walked in vicky  the owner introduced herself and welcomed us. beautiful decor. and warm and invitingvery clean. everyone working was so kind and the girls loved the slushys and snacks!! thank you for a great day of pampering!!
great nail spa!!!! pedicures are amazing with great massage, warmed lotion and steam towels.  great complimentary drinks and snacks.  also offers tanning, facials and waxingthreading.  my moms gel manicure was best ive seen.
what a wonderful experience!  this place is close to my home and i couldnt be happier.  everything i need regularly.  vicki the owner couldnt be more personable and she even gave me a courtesy session of mystic tan!  so awesome!  you need to try chloe spa for your nail, waxing, tanning, facial, wrap needs.  who needs groupon when theres a place this good!!!
chloe spa is your one stop shop for all your beauty needs! not only do they do amazing manipedis but they also have a facial room for waxings and facials, and a mystic tanner! i came in for a manicure, and kayla was my manicurist. she is patient and pays attention to the little details. i really appreciate her professionalism. my friend came in and got the manipedi set and she was so comfortable she fell asleep in her massage chair with two guys doting on her! haha! its been about 2 weeks since i came in and my nails are just now beginning to chip. normally, because i wash my hands compulsively they only last about 34 days with regular nail polish. it was my first time getting the gelish nails and im in looove!! i dont think i can ever go back to regular polish now. i will have to make sure i come in and get my nails done the next time i am in vegas!
i am not a nail or spa person but i took my companion here for a facial.  this is a new business and it is a fancy place that reminded me of a high end hotel spa, which is kind of  unusual. the staff is very friendly and helpful.  my companion was very pleased with the facial.  their equipment is modern and they use highend facial products that are made in us.  this shop is very clean with impressive modern decor.  the owner told my companion that the nail products are organic.  so i guess, i will be bringing my companion back soon for manicure and pedicure; very pleased with their excellent service.  also, while waiting, i was offered a refreshment without any pressure to buy their products.  my companion highly recommends this shop.
girls day!! very high end  product but not price... so beautiful and very very friendly
today was my first time here. not only does this place look nice it has a great vibe to it. i love the staff here, theres a lot of friendly people. if you want a good foot massage  pedicure this is the place to go! ill definitely come back in a couple weeks !!!
beautiful nail spa.  friendly staff. clean and very modern. close to home which is convenient great services provided. a great way to spend time with the girls!
super friendly staff!!   a very beautiful, very clean, and inviting nail spa!  my daughter and i love getting our pedicures together and spending quality time together. we will definitely be spending our time here from now on!
this place is a gem. granted ive only visited once for a pedimani, but im so glad to have found this spa!  the owner was very attentive, the nail technicians that worked on me were very professional and gentle.  most importantly though was that the spa itself was exceptionally clean!  i felt extremely at ease knowing i was not going to catch some funky fungus or infection. they use disposable liners on their foot tubs and use an autoclave to disinfect their tools which made me very happy.  they also used small disposable tools that i got to take home with me, another reassurance that im not getting  previous jane does skin cells or nail filings rubbed on me.  i also liked that they use led lights vs uv with the gels which if you care about skin damage is the way to go!, the foot massage was heavenly! and im one to always dread the massage because i have soresensitive arches.  i wasnt rushed out of the door like other places ive been to.  truly a great spa, everyone was so pampering that i cant wait to go back and try other services.
awesome experience. very friendly, beautiful spa, lovely customer service. best part...  completely sanitary! vicky and her daughter kayla are lovely, you feel youve known them for years.
i was fortunate enough to discover chloe spa recently and i have to share.  walking into the spa, one feels like theyve escape the hustle bustle of the city and entered into a beautiful, tranquil space.  i was promptly greeted and tanya happily offered me assistance in choosing a nail color.  loved the special attention.  the spa is extremely clean and well kept.  the lovely owner, vicky, introduced herself and i noticed how wellmanaged the business is.  i had a wonderful, relaxing experience and my manipedi still looks great and has held up very well.  treat yourself and escape to chloe spa!
my sister and i went there today.  first we had a facial...omg.  it was awesome.  very relaxing.  when done, my sinuses were clear, the tension in my neck and upper back were relieved, my face was soft and glowing.  i would soooo recommend the facial.  we also had a pedicure and i had a manicure.  the job they did, was fanastic.  they took their time and treated us very special.  the staff was very friendly and the place easy clean and cozy.  if your looking for great service and a 10 plus on spoiling, this is the place to go.
fantastic spa! very clean. gorgeous and spacious. sanitized is a must. they put removable liners in the pedi bowl and so your feet never touch the actual bowl. love this idea. a on that. staff amazing and very accommodating. they make you feel like youre at home. ! they have tanning ,facial, waxing,mani  pedi.  i got the deluxe she massage my legs for 25 mins each. wonderful! lots of blingvery impressed.atm onsite very convenient. love this place.  ill be back again. trust me youll love it too!
awesome place! very clean and beautiful salon.  service is topnotch, and i love that they offer polishes with fewer chemicals.
this was my first visit and i was impressed . all natural looking nails from the signature nail system  . i highly recommend for a thinner yet stronger natural nail.  from the massage chairs to the keurig cappuccinos  also very clean uses liners in the pedi bowls and all new files and buffers each time. i like that they were open on a sun. until 7 pm shops are usually open till 5 . im glad my regular place was booked today bc now i found a better and closer place to get my nails and pedis done . also first time you get 30 off any signature nail service ! thank you vicki
im giving them 5 stars coz they deserved it. just had a pedicure spa today and its my first time on this spa. all i can say is that the spa itself is very clean, gorgeous and it smells good. everything is in order. nice equipment. variety of nail polishes to choose from. this is the nicest spa that ive been to. services are really awesome. nail tech is very focus and detailed, not in a rush or whatever. theyre using disposable nail tools which i like about. vicki, the owner always checks if youre doing good or if youre fine and making sure that you feel comfy. i love the massage chair, very relaxing thats thy i fell asleep. i would definitely come back here and recommend this place.
i am visiting from los angeles and needed a manipedi badly. i liked this salon because they had a lot of reviews about how sanitary they are. the store recently opened so it looks clean and very well kept. the massage chairs are comfortable and high end. there is even a small bar area with water, coffee, tea, juice and some small snacks. i will definitely come back when i am in las vegas. we come often so it is good to know that i can have my nails done here last minute by friendly people.
awesome food and service!!  i would come here everyday!!keep opening these up!!  location looks great guys!!
amazing food, first time there and i will return. staff was great. took suggestion of blackened mahi mahi. cooked perfect, tasted amazing! much better then other places that i paid more. great value, bang for your buck!
amazing tacos tonight! the tortillas were fresh and just the perfect amount of crispy, the coconut milk cole slaw and fresh mango salsa  yum!! i dont know what it is about the french fries but they really are the best fries ever, i could eat a basket no problem i order the side just to ensure this doesnt happen.  the staff are so friendly, always helpful and prompt. the decor is too fun! love the murals and woodwork  everything was done to perfection.
found this great maui gem in the heart of scottsdale ! so friendly! high quality and amazing coconut shrimp and fish tacos! the french fries were delish also! highly recommend this cute new  restaurant!
thank you! best fish ive had in a while. kids loved the coconut shrimp, and the fish tacos compete with anything on the mainland. mahalo!
this place is amazing i love the fish tacos fish burger blackened is my alltime favorite
nice fish thats well seasoned at a fair price.  i like the mahi cajun style and enjoy the brown rice and cole slaw that comes with the order.  their green iced tea is delicious and the employees are super friendly!
great food, great service! the mahi fish tacos are pretty amazing!
eddie is 5 stars. the guy makes this place exceptional. outstanding food. one of a kind.
i accidentally posted his to their other location which im sure is equally as good but want to make sure this new spot gets the credit it deserves. super friendly staff convinced us to come in and try their famous fish tacos and we were not disappointed. sooooooooo so good. my husband and i split one order and a side of onion rings also legit. good vides, great food, well be back for sure!!
first time here  loved it! there wasnt a table available but the table turnover seemed somewhat fast so after waiting at the bar bar table, not bar drinks we got one before our food was brought out. the employees know their stuff. they educate you, share info, and make the experience a good one. they really get an a on their customer service  outstanding training  attitudes. the food was yum. loved it! i wasnt stuffed but i was incredibly satisfied...and guilt free! this place is small, yet they get the job done. theres extended seating outside which is great but not until our 110 days are done. meanwhile the petite inside offers adorable wooden tables that resemble surfboards  a nice bar to sit at as well.
best fish tacos in town hands down! ive eaten here a few times now and they have been equally fabulous every time. the grilled mahi mahi that they use is extremely fresh and never even a hint of fishy taste to them. actually im pretty sure people that dont like  fish would even approve of the mahi mahi that they serve here. in addition to the fish the taco is topped wi an amazing coleslaw mixture and a deliciously refreshing mango salsa that just sets it off. the staff is always very friendly, and the restaurant is always very clean and super contemporary. theres no wait staff so you order at the counter and they bring your food out to you on a real plate which makes it great if your in a hurry but dont want the fast food experience. plus they pick up after you. its such an awesome place and ive been telling all of my clients about it since i work right across the street. also the coconut shrimp is really good too but just make sure your hungry. the tacos come in an order of 2 which i was skeptical at first since im a big eater but their huge and fill me up every time. i love this place and cant wait to take my friends and family here.
long board, fish tacos and coconut shrimp....heaven.  full house, sevice still great and friendly.  consistently good food is wonderful and fresh!
sooooooo good!!!! this is a must try. went with a friend and the girl at the counter suggested splitting the coconut shrimp appetizer and one order of fish tacos since neither of us were overly starving. this was perfect! the coconut shrimp app was the best ive ever had. not greasy at all and the dip was amazing. and there is nothing i could possibly critique about the tacos. they are todie for!!go here now. be prepared to have a new fish taco obsession. sorry not sorry
i ordered the mahi cajun style and my husband ordered the fish and chips. the food was excellent! we fish and chips were done just right! the service was just as great. the servers were so helpful and nice. i definitely will be going back. i highly recommend this place
i wish i could give this place 10 stars. very small but a nice outside seating with misters. the staff is friendly and helpful, i do not like fish, i do like seafood so the coconut shrimp is excellent. the coconut used is fresh and it is delicious. they also have chicken dishes, great salads, steak salad is good and evn though i do not like coleslaw, i like theirs, made with horseradish in with the light sauce. you get what you pay for. i have read people saying the prices are high. coconut shrimp and cole slaw for 10 is not expensive. you will love the crisp shrimp and it is not oily or greasy at all. great onion rings and the sauce that comes with the shrimp has a slight kick. i even it out with a little ketchup. yum!!!!
i just had the macadamia nut mahi mahi and it was fantastic! my little girl had fish and chips, also, terrific! great food, great service!!! please open in queen creek, we need a healthy, wonderful place like coconuts!!!love it!!!!
the tacos were fresh and tasty. service was impeccable. would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!
our favorite fish tacos on maui opened up a location in scottsdale, so i had to try it out while in town.  well, it looks, feels and tastes exactly the same as kihei!  hands down, the best fish tacos in existence.  when are you going to open a spot in washington?
awesome spot plain and simple. menu was ample with choice, prices were right where they should be and not outrageous, given the location. beer on site was not just the plain dive bar regular stuff, a few microbrews, atmosphere was very relaxing with the option to dine in or out on the patio. plenty of customer service with a smile and most importantly, the food was great! i had the shrimp tacos which seems to be what theyre known for and rightfully so. i will definitely come back whenever in the area but will definitely have a hard time not ordering the same because i definitely want to try more of their menu.
this is awesome food for a great value. very very consistent!! love this place... shhhhh....
this is awesome food for a great value. very very consistent!! love this place... shhhhh....if you look at my reviews they are probably rated either 1 or 5. my reviews are based on either a great experience or bad experience.  i dont review average experiences. so if i give 5 stars i mean it!of course i also mean it when i give 1 star.
great clam chowder and appetizers. the staff and manger were very friendly and attentive.
i came here at the request of a friend. boy am i glad i did. those have got to be some of the best damn fish  chips i have ever had.  cooked perfectly and the fries were delicious. my mother and i were treated by a young woman named stephany who seemed very happy to assist us and another young woman named rachel attended to us even while were eating. bringing us extra sides and checking on us. this place gave me and my mother a great experience and the food was delicious. i highly suggest coming here and also expect excellent customer service
this place is legit. hands down the best fish tacos in az. eat them with your hands and use your sleeve as a napkin. as fresh as it gets.
this place is a must!  yummy coconut shrimp. the fish is perfectly grilled and fresh. loved the macadamia nut mahi mahi. delicious and reasonably priced.
excellent mahi mahi fish tacos! if you are up for a quick snack or lunch, this is the spot! reviews are true flavorful fish tacos. wish we have same in nyc.
aloha to my new fave! ok folks, this is some seriously fresh and delicious food. my partner doesnt like fish tacos and when he went and loved it, i figured i had to try it!ive been twice, once alone and once with 3 friends. both experiences were excellent. firstly, the place is clean and i love the decor. it will make you miss the islands. even though its in a strip mall facing a parking lot; they did an excellent job making an atmospheric patio!the food is super fresh and super tasty! beer is fresh too. the staff is engaged, committed, knowledgable and as friendly and helpful as you could want. do yourself a favor and check it out.
its not cheap but the food is great and really worth it.  the fish tacos are not to be missed and i really enjoyed the fish and chips, too.  the service is quite good; you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.  last time i was there, i noticed the staff working very hard to ask customers what more they needed, clear tables and just generally keep the place clean and keep things moving.  the employees are unfailingly friendly.this is a good place.  try it!
a bit pricey but the best fish tacos i have ever had . i will definitely go again
nice little place with wifi and great service! i ordered the fish taco mountain which is served over brown rice rather than shells. mmmmmmm its good
so great! i had a breakfast sandwich with bacon, and sweet potato tater tots the tots are perfection. friend got hash browns and said they were delicious. this place is fast, and easily customizable. would go for a quick bite, or to catch up with a friend!
great experience. had eggs over easy w some of the best bacon ever, along with a pancake and iced coffee. all were delicious.staff was friendly. no liquor license yet for a bloody mary, but was told that should be in place soon. this will be a regular weekend breakfast spot for me.
the experience: been there twice and i just moved here from san diego last week. went on sunday around 10:30 it was busy we waited five minutes for a table. went back on tuesday and it wasnt as busy but the food was just as good. food is good, prices are  reasonable. this location is youthful and fun with lots of bright light and a college crowd.the food: i ordered the blueberry pancakes and a waffle dog.  a breakfast sausage dipped in waffle batter and deep fried  to delicious perfection. the french toast was great, as was the coffee.
i approached this place with pessimism . because how can we possibly have another breakfast joint in downtown tempe? well, it is really good. i have a made to order sausage, peppers and cheese omelet with a side of bacon...frickin awesome. my guest had steak and eggs....it was huge and also very good. i will be going back soon!
i knew they had one in arcadia so i gave it a try.  it was just as good as expected.  i enjoyed my favorite, the bourbon glazed french toast.  the place was clean and the wait staff was nice.  i would go back and i would suggest it.
excellent spot for breakfast near mill st. not as rowdies, but excellent choices and services. highly recommended.
good food, good experience.  always is.  i love this place and tempe is as good as arcadia :
vengan a la rumba night club se pone bueno los domingos noche latina bachata, salsa merenge,
a welcome addition to the concordia neighbourhood.  authentic chinese, but not as hard core authentic as the nearby and well loved shi tang.ive had lunch here twice.  the first lunch was the cafeteria style lunch where you chose 3 items.  the tofu choice was particularly good.  my second lunch was the fried egg and bbq pork... i see myself grabbing this quite often as i work nearby; there is something to be said about rice and a fried egg!hassle free credit card payments, a rarity for the chinese places in the neighbourhood.
one of my favourite chinese restaurant in mtl. every time i go to this place, i always order their combo. this time i ordered dry wok, they put shrimps, pork, chicken wings and vegetables in a pot. it tastes like a dry hot pot lol. i have never tried this kind of chinese food before, it was incredible! if you have no idea what you can get, ask the staff to help you out, they have a lot of tasty things available.
i love this place.  finally a reflexology location in the san tan valley area.  not only is it the only type of its kind in this area...but its also extremely affordable for a 1 hour massage!  previously i would need to travel into gilbert or chandler ... not any more. the whole process was amazing from endtoend.  i highly recommend them.  i also heard that they may have an additional addon soon where you can add 15 minutes to the end of your massage to lay and relax or in my case ... sleep...which of course would be the greatest thing ever ... since no other place offers that option.  give them a try...you wont be disappointed.
the best massage ever! i at first was concerned because the massages are thru the clothing and wondered if the masseuse could directly treat my back pain. sophie did my massage and i will never go anywhere else; seriously. my insurance pays for massages at my chiropractors office but i will gladly pay 35 an hour plus tip at relaxology. it was full body, which i didnt think i needed but it was amazing! and my back is 1000 times better!the environment was soothing, quiet and professional. the girl at the front desk was very caring, smart and sweet. she should be the manager, if she isnt already...she is sincere in the quality of the customers experience. i have never written a review but had to yelp this because i cant believe how great it was. i am definitely going to be a, regular there. best business model and employees i have ever had the pleasure of seeing and meeting. sophie is my girl!i cant imagine anyone not loving this place. they do walkins and by appointment. try it!

courtney has been my hair dresser for the last 4 years but has been doing hair for over 10 years. she cuts, colors, and styles my hair regularly. she just got done coloring my hair bring pink in fact, a pink ombre. it looks great.courtney is also my makeup artist. she has accompanied me to photo shoots and prepares me for various events when needed. i couldnt speak more highly of any other hair stylist. shes a great person too, fun to talk with. shes very easy going and is willing to drive any where for a hair or makeup client.if you decide to go with courtney ness you wont go wrong. i highly recommend her.
courtney has been doing my hair for well over 3 years and she is amazing! having naturally curly hair, its always been hard for me to find someone that keeps that in mind while finding a style that works with the curls or when i straighten it. she has it nailed down for me! she also did my hair and makeup for my wedding and ive never felt more glamorous! she truly is the best and sweetest, most genuine person out there! and great prices on top of that! you wont be disappointed!!
courtney did a fabulous job on my hair! i had hair to my middle of my back and i had her cut it all off to a aline cut! as a hair dresser myself i can say we are very picky on who cuts our hair and she did a great job!
courtney is amazing. she is always able to squeeze me into her busy schedule. my business partner and i had courtney do our hair for our professional photos and she did a fabulous job. her prices are unbeatable and shes such a great person. i would highly recommend her... i am the type of person that always changes my hair stylist every year but ive been working with courtney for over a year now  have no plans on leaving her!
courtney has been doing my girls hair for prom ever since we moved here. she is such a sweet person and she even came to our home and had been in contact with each of my girls to insure that they got the hair style that they really wanted. since doing my girls hair she has continued to stay in contact with myself and the girls . she has become one of our biggest cheerleaders . she has always expressed sincere concern for each of us . she has mad skill at her job. i have yet to see her anything she has done turn out badly . i would highly recommend her. give her a call . you will not regret it! plus, you get to make a new friend.
courtney is extremely talented and very reasonably priced. i would recommend using her for any occasion but especially major events when you want to look your very best. shes the best!
i found courtney online for my wedding and after having a trial with her, i was sold! since then she has become my regular stylist as well. the day of the wedding courtney came on time with her assistant, and did hair and makeup for my bridal party. she is very professional, but easy to talk to, like youve known her forever!
where do i begin. i was looking for a makeup artist and hair stylist for my upcoming wedding and someone referred her. im so glad i reached out to her. i did my trial a few days ago and all i can say is amazing! she is absolutely amazing so talented. i booked to have my engagement photos done the same day not realizing how hot it would be.  im thinking this makeup will be ruined for this 2 hour shoot. can i say flawless the whole time. it was over 115 and the makeup was still perfect. im not a big makeup person so i felt this makeup is going to be so heavy and caked on. but total opposite it looks super natural and lightweight hopefully that makes sense. if you dont use her your crazy. i would recommend her to everyone. if only i can make more money to have her do my make up daily........ anyone hiring for part time? lol    thank you courtney again i cant wait until the wedding!
i needed a makeup artist and hairstylist for my upcoming wedding this november and was so glad my friend recommended courtney! she was reasonably priced and was eager to share albums of hair styles and makeup she did on previous clients! i was so happy to schedule my trial run and in the end, she did an amazing job! courtney listened to what i wanted and it all turned out perfect. i cant wait for the big day!
did you know that people in nyc pay over 300month for the exact same workout?but this is pgh, you say, and that is correct. im just pointing out a fact. as with all gyms and workouts, you choose the best for you. sure, you may save a lot more  by going to a lowcost monthly gym im still a member and have been for 10 years, but how many times will you really go? are you getting an effective or as intense of a workout? are you ok with the mediocre classes? what about trying to cancel the membership? in the end, you choose the gym that will get you closer to whatever goal you set for yourself, and for me, its group fitness classes since its more well rounded.otf caters to all fitness levels: there are some that are clearly fit, and some that look like they havent been to a gym for many years. the workouts are what you make of it, and the atmosphere is not intimidating at all. the gym is new enough and the people are nice enough that i havent felt that the atmosphere was clicky like the soul cycle groupies in nyc. the gym trainers are very nice and come to class with a good playlist. ive been at otf since they opened so about 25 or so classes. even though i post on yelp on the regular, i didnt want to write one on otf since working outgym is a very personal thing for me i dont really know anyone at the gym, i dont really converse with anyone else, and i dont make small convo with the trainers. in these 25 classes or so, ive started to get to know the trainers just a smidge more, and that was really from the effort of the trainers, not me. the classes are personal enough that when they see you regularly, they notice you and what youre capable of. you can read about the workout on the website, and if youre reading this review, you probably have already. out of the many gyms ive gone to for group fitness in philly and nyc, this one offers the most classes, from 5am to 9pm, depending on the day. they still have kinks to work out, but theyll figure it out. yes, otf is in east liberty, on the edge of shadyness, but as long as you dont wave benjamins around on the street, you should be fine.
facility is clean and the staff at the front desk is so helpful. they remember your name and greet you by it as you come in.the trainers are all great though lj is my favorite. he motivates and pushes without making you feel horrible. ive seen great results with regular attendance!
in love with orangetheory fitness! a few friends recommended the workout to me  they loved it and thought i would, too. the workout flies by. im someone who finds myself getting antsy in a 1 hr yoga class but otf classes are over so quickly because youre always changing your movement. its an interval based training with cardio  strength circuits. at the beginning of each class, youll review the days workout and start with either cardio or strength. halfway through, you switch. during the workout, you wear a heart rate monitor the gym has a few loaners if you dont own one and you can check in with your effort on the tv screens. im a gal who loves being able to look at data to better understand something to seeing how much effort im actually giving during certain exercises is really fascinating! at the end of class, you can review your times in each hr zone. there are so many classes scheduled throughout the day  from 5a to 745p so its super easy to find a time thats convenient for you. this location is great, too  lots of street parking! what i loved most about this workout besides the data, is the intensity  it reminded me of high school sports practice! everyone is working hard towards a common goal and knocking out their circuits. highly recommend this workout; the trainers are great, the participants are great, the workout is hard but leaves you feeling good. tired but good!

chatime is a very popular chain of bubble tea aka boba found throughout the streets of taiwan. since its opening, this shop has been filled with people every time i walk by it i do work just around the corner. you can customize the amount of sugar and ice in your drinks, and as a bubble tea shop, it is perhaps one of be best you can find in edinburgh. definitely a place my friends and i frequent. a bit expensive to go too much, but well worth it if you like bubble tea.
i just got back from asia where i had been indulging in chatimes milk teas on what was almost a daily basis. chatime is known for offering authentic taiwanese bubble tea, a hot or cold beverage teabased beverage which is usually sweet and super fun to drink thanks to the bubbles which wizz up your straw. i was amazed to see that a new branch had been opened in edinburgh. and right in the historic heart of the city, close to the castle, waverly station and the royal mile. so far i have been relatively conservative, going for the original milk tea  or the jasmine green tea with black tapioca pearls. i like that you can choose your ice level and the sweetness. slight sugar is perfect for me though i can imagine full sugar is quite syrupy. the tea is served in superhygienic plastic glasses which are machinesealed after the cha has been made. inevitably, the bubble tea is far superior to those found in frisky. great addition to edinburghs diverse foodie scene.
i think my post actually made some progress! i posted 2 weeks ago and the tanning machine is cleaner than it was before, so perhaps a mountain side staph infection may have been avoided.  plus the girls took of their clown make up and prom hair. i wanted to update the  breathable times to go to the gym. i found them to be around 6 am till about 8. then its like one big night club till about 1pm. thats when i sneak in, pretty much have the free reign to get they your work out with out someone setting their pig. however you stay into that 3 oclock hour you are asking to watch magic mike! all the guys who work graveyards stripping,bartending, bouncing  all show up around here which would seem odd because not many chips do so its sorta just lots of dudes in strange outfits. there are some attractive ladies and i like to watch the guy watch her. see i cashed out i got a beautiful wife but i see all these banana heads to do their work out so chicks will notice them, its funny as hell seeing guys jump of a bench press and yell like he just sacked a qb! this should have a live stream to watch from anywhere. gym behavior is funny!
mountainside has a massage therapist onsite. her name is sabrina hargrave. 9072505077. had my first massage with her tonight n it was great. she made me feel really comfortable n listened to what i needed. she does chair massage n table massage. prices r really reasonable for members n non members. chair massages r 1 per minute for member n nonmember. table massage is 45 for members n 60 for non members for an hour. try her out she is great
i needed my locks changed because i lost my keys, they came out right away to my house and got the locks rekeyed quickly and i was very happy with their prompt service, i appreciated that there were no hidden fees and they gave me an accurate quote when other locksmiths could not!... i would recommend this company to anyone i know.
looking for a legit locksmith in phoenix? call snowmans! i called snowmans lock and key to rekey a rental property in scottsdale. michael, the owner, came out and rekeyed about 7 locks, both high security and normal security. he is licensed and insured so i felt very comfortable with his services. most locksmiths in the phoenix valley are not licensed or insured im pretty sure most arent even legal residents. if you need a quality locksmith in phoenix, call snowmans lock and key!
michael went above and beyond to locate the correct key for my file cabinet. he did the research and found where to special order it from and took care of everything! customer service was well above my expectations! everyone should use him!
my friends and i came here after the club.  good thing theyre 24 hours.  we order some drinks along with fish and chips and other finger foods.  everything tasted good.  so glad they had sriracha.  i scarfed that down.we didnt finish everything so we had our server get us boxes.  then we needed more and another server went to get it.  i had asked for some sriracha to go and he said they didnt have it.  what a liar.  i called him out on that too calling him a liar.  moments later he returned with a box and a container of sriracha...our main server was awesome.  he did everything as expect and beyond.
great, accessible, 24hour place. i am a sucker for breakfast food so i tried both this place and cafe bellagio. this place wins, easily.first of all, it is eversoslightly cheaper than cafe bellagio okay, 12 isnt much, but still. dont get me wrong, i dont eat or drink at places like caesers palace and bellagio to save money, but it is still an indicative factor.second, hash browns, much better than cb, smaller portion, but you also get toast. at cb toast was a separate side item, cost extra. what.third, the toast comes unbuttered so you can portion the butter yourself. thank you! more places need to do this!fourth, the service, once seated, was phenomenal. i believe i was helped by ryan k, at least thats what is on my receipt, and he was prompt, courteous, professional, and checked back often to ensure i had everything i needed. more servers need to do this!getting seated, however, was disastrous. it wasnt even busy. lots of open tables, but for each group in line they were setting up tables adhoc. maybe i came right after a huge rush left? i dont know, im not docking any stars for this  i just felt for being third in line, that the wait was kind of laughable.will definitely be back.
thank god this place is open 247! my boyfriend and i stopped by to grab a bite after clubbing and finding out that the grand lux cafe our usual spot to satisfy our late night cravings in vegas was having problems with its kitchen. we ordered takeout and only sat at the bar for awhile but it was still a very pleasant experience!while at the bar, we got ourselves acquainted with the bar manager, adrian, and wow, this guy is the real mvp! he was nice enough to personally walk to the kitchen to ask for a glass of dr pepper for me i was badly craving it and they didnt have it at the bar. he also got behind the bar and made us delicious drinks free of charge! the other bartenders were also really friendly and attentive to their guests.enough about the bar, now on to the food! we ordered the wings which were a bit pricey and a whole hog pizza. honestly, the wings were mediocre but the pizza was definitely worth our money! even if youre not looking to dine in, definitely make a visit to the bar!
overall a great dining experience here last night. my family and i were hungry for a late night dinner and we stumbled upon here in ceasars palace. open 247 but very cute set up, a little more on the trendy side and not your normal 247 cafe place. our food was delicious. we all got a variety of different things, and they all were great! we had the octopus pizza, the burger, the breakfast platter, and the applewood smoked ham and turkey sandwich.the thing that truly made our visit great was the service from everyone danielle our waitress jonathon our waiterbus boy and the bar manager adrian. everyone was so friendly and great. i would like to especially recognize jonathon for his above and beyond service to us, even offering us water cups to go since its hot outside! he was great.we will definitely be back. i am in the restaurant industry and heard this is their first one on the west coast so i truly do wish you all the best of luck! continue with the great food and service and you will do well thats the recipe for success! thanks again and see you all next time!
great spot to eat dinner and have some drinks. food was yummy. they have basically any drink you could want, with some liquors bars dont usually carry. friendly staff with great eye candy. id definitely go back.
on our recent vegas vacation, we stumbled into the americano and i had the best sandwich i have ever eaten! the cuban sandwich had nearly 2 high of pulled pork, a perfect size slice of real country baked ham, guyere cheese, mayo, pickles and onions, all on a grilled slab of bread with no grease. onehalf of the sandwich wouldve been more than enough. it came with choice of french fries or salad. i had the salad, all a spring mix of greens. my husband got a reuben with 2 tall of corned beef and the traditional reuben items. he got the fries, a very generous, very hot portion. great atmosphere, sandwiches served on a thick wooden cutting board, linen napkins...manager in a suit stopped by our table. highly recommend!
luis our waiter was amazing! we stopped by at 4am after leaving the club. even though it was 4am luis had a great attitude and was very helpful. he made a great suggestion, he told us to try the short rib nachos. these nachos are the best nachos ive had in a long time. everything was delicious on these nachos. the chips were perfection. even though its an appetizer its a generous portion. my boyfriend and i were happily full by the time we finished the nachos. so remember if you come during their late night hours definitely get the short rib nachos. i promise you wont regret it. thanks again luis! you made us feel very welcomed on our first visit to cafe americana.
just like to say breakfast was really good, we will definetly come back , best on the strip  !
anyone who gives them less than five stars is nuts. and im basing that on the food only. the service was just ok, but the food was off the hook! i cannot say that enough! i had pancakes, which were the best pancakes ive ever had in my whole entire life! out of this world!
we went in for a traditional breakfast, and returned every day of our stay at caesars.  did breakfasts, late lunches, and great full meals with a bottle of wine.  chef matthew has developed a great menu for each. try the huevos rancheros, or items from the skinny menu, or his home fries with sweet potato pieces. the salmon fillet with citrus spinach was excellent. the cafe is considered casual dining, the ambience was relaxed but the wait staff was friendly and attentive;  so though the prices are vegas strip you are at caesars, it was great value  excellent menu, attentive service.we loved the location just across the main lobby from the casino hustle.
eddie at the bar is will make your nighttoo funny! the food is greati had the latino vegan ouinoa! the outside patio has like 10 tvs git to watch the warriors continue their streak!
ill be honest... i didnt actually seek out this place. my brother and i were waiting for the rest of our group to meet us at caesars. we had some time to kill and so we wandered into cafe americano, which is just inside the main entrance of the hotel giant. we ordered a couple standard drinks and glanced at the menu for a small bite to eat. pulled pork nachos caught both of our eyes. it was the best plate of nachos i have ever had. while a bit pricey at 23 by far the most expensive appetizer, the portion was for 4 people at least. it was a mountain of goodness and with the eventual help of 3 other joiners, we finished it all. the service was great. the food was incredible. the drinks were everything we asked for. no complaints. a fitting establishment for the entrance of a palace.
everything about this company is amazing! the staff is so sweet and always very welcoming. i do cryotherapy every single day after i work out. its gives me a burst of energy after my hard workout and makes me feel amazing. my muscles recover faster, it burns up to 800 calories so my body fat stays low, i just love everything about it and i will continue doing it foreva and ever.
great place! the girls are super nice  inviting  the cryotherapy chamber is immaculate. clean facility, great service, what more could you ask for?! they also gave one in summerlin  i hear a 3rd is opening near the strip which will be closer for me even.
its damn freaking cold! but damn freaking good and efficient! i went there to try the cryo chamber. 3 minutes at a 230f temperature, almost naked, but it gives you strength and boosts your energy levels. plus i had a pain in my leg for more than 10 days, and it almost disappeared right after. great service too, the team is doing a great job! i highly recommend it.
first time i ever had cryotherapy  was today, and i must say it was the most amazing experience! i wasnt sure what to expect but the entire process was so simple. and the ladies that greeted me there; christine, elise and royal were beyond friendly and eager to accommodate! christine walked me through the entire process and stood outside my door talking to me the entire time. this was very helpful since it gets cold as fk in there. 3 minutes go by fast and youre done!!! i can honestly say i left feeling euphoric and knew immediately i would do that again had to buy a month package!!. im big on customer service so i really want to say thank you the ladies there for being so friendly and easy to talk to!!! definitely recommend and i will be back in a few days ladies ... keep my spot cold ;
i wasskeptical going into it.. but i cant even begins to express how amazing i feel. my girlfriends and i did both types of facials offered and the cryochamber. my face feels so tight and smooth, and my body is ache free along w feeling super energized. i cant wait to go back :
i was recently hearing in the news about cryotherapy and wanted to check it out. i came into rejuvenice for the first time and this place is amazing! great looking facility, friendly staff and then i was introduced to what i like to do on a weekly basis. the cryo chamber was exactly what all the hype was about. its cold but cooling and i did 2 mins and jumped back in for another 3 mins burning up to 800 calories! they also have a cryo facial which felt very cool and relaxing! the next time i came in i tried the hydra facial and this is by far my favorite facial ive ever had. i cant get enough of this place! when i walk out of rejuvenice it totally stands up for its name! now i am here 23 times a week! my results are mind blowing! definitely recommend it for anyone that is trying to recover from physical activity it will cut down your recovering time in no time!
this place is great great location and awesome staff, i will definitely be coming back and referring friends to this place. thank you christine!
amazing! the staff is friendly and professional and the office is very clean. i tried all three of their services. i am very impressed. will definitely go back again. if you dont know what cryotherapy is, you should check it out, all kinds of different applications.
it was my first time trying the chamber you stand inside it for 3minutes.  i felt pretty amazing afterwards. excited to see if i notice any of the benefits! i will keep you posted....
i came here on the opening day, and so far the employees are very nice. they dont pressure you to buy anything. the store is full of inventory and carries mens and female apperal. vince is perfect for phoenixscottsdale
i came here today, the desert was pretty good, and the place is really big, loved the tea!! durian rolls tasty really good! very fresh. and the service is good too, they always smile!
this is very, very good dessert，especially quicksand pineapple buns, like sweet friends must try, as well as almond, taste is very special,
been here so many times for lunch since they open. love love love their dim sum. the lovely ladies boss, bb and our hostess jenny make us keep comming back! will be back try their dinner soon, keep u all post!!
been here many times services were great stuff friendly food great and lot of parking spaces
came here for dim sum and the food was great. the service provided was exceptional. because of that, we came back for dinner that same day. traveled from san francisco, ca to vegas for vacation, but i would return here again if i come back to vegas next time. this is a new establishment so i encourage you to come here before it gets packed.
all the foods we were order was delicious. i would like to recommend to everyone in state and other people that just come to visit in las vegas. good place to come
great food, open late. very kind people and if youre looking to eat some chinese then go here. unfortunate they dont give fortune cookies.
food was superb. service excellent. very accommodating. price was very reasonable. for only being open less than six months you need to visit this fine establishment
an amazing place to dine with family and friends. the food is fantastic and the people are very warm.  i am defenetly going back.
the owners of this restaurant are an incredible couple and will make you feel like family when you are there. the beef tibs are amazing and you have to try them.
the food is authentic ethiopian. amazing flavor and very reasonable prices with friendly service. highly recommended! !!!  this  place is truly a treasure...
what a wonderful surprise. and this is the best ethiopian food youll find in arizona. it is a new family owned business, that is a real gem. the family, being from ethiopia, found no real ethiopian food in the valley, and thus opened abyssinia ethiopian restaurant. i found it because they currently are on restaurant.com. i did some research and realized how wonderful this place is. its in a simple strip mall, a place you would not even notice if you were not heading there. this is not fast food, they made everything we ordered to order. and if you are up to it, they serve like you would get at their home no plates, or silverware. eating with your hands with that wonderful inerja bread adds to the whole experience.by the time we left the restaurant was relatively full, filled with lots of neighbors who also probably grew up in ethiopia. i love to support local businesses and especially family owned businesses. give this one a chance
we devoured every bite of the vegetarian platter and sucked the spices from our fingers couldnt help it  even if rude!  we took our 8 yr old daughter and she loved the lentils and split peas way more than at home. simply delicious and we cant wait to eat it again.
wow! what a delicious and wonderful experience. we came to abyssinia for a family celebration. we didnt know what to expect and we were very pleased with the absolutely top notch, authentic ethiopian food and hospitality. we will absolutely be back!
this place is amazing.  i went there with my wife and one of her friends for lunch.  it was the first time any of us tried ethiopian food.  the host, who i believe is one of the owners, was very friendly, and gave us suggestions about what to order.  once the food arrived, we could not stop eating it!  the meats were very delicious, and the injera was great when it soaked up all the flavor.  ill definitely be back, though id recommend bringing more than just two people.  even with three of us, we couldnt finish our food.
first time eating ethiopian food. it was delicious, flavorful, and fresh. i will be back!
fantastic food! we asked for a recommendation from our waiter for one meat and one veggie dish and were not disappointed! probably the best ethiopian ive had and always a fun experience if youve never tried it. i would highly recommend it!
food was amazing! home cooking at its finest! joshua and his wife are extremely kind, gracious, and generous.  we will be back soon.
weve been here twice now  once with just the hubby and i, and the second time we knew we had to bring the kids.  the owners are so friendly!  they kept insisting we take more injeera that delicious flat bread that you eat everything with and gave my kids an impromptu lesson on ethiopia.the food is amazing i especially loved all of the chickpea dishes, and i cant wait until the next time we go back!  now i just need to actually save room to try some dessert.. they give you so much food that i keep being too full!
the hubs and i were fiending for ethiopian food and wanted to try someplace new. after seeing the great yelp reviews for this recently opened restaurant, we felt sure we would find some fantastic food here and we were not disappointed. couldnt decide on just one item each so we shared the veggie combo, doro wat, and awaze tibs. the veggie dishes were wonderful, but the doro wat and awaze tibs were the stars of the plate. perfectly seasoned, with a great spice level on the awaze tibs  and both meats were tender. the injera was also very tasty. we will definitely be coming here again.
i went in today w my brother. my brother and i had the vegan plate, no meat, no dairy, no animal byproducts whatsoever. it was exactly what i wanted. the plate was big and it was perfect for two people the share. the bread is called teff thats has been in ethiopia for over 3,00 years the server informed us. he also informed us that it was high in fiber and iron. i also did some research and found that it was very high in protein as well. i love that they have vegan options, that they use olive oil, and that the customer service was excellent. also, for the glutenfree lifestyle, they can certainly accommodate toc starting w teff.
incredible authentic ethiopian dining experience. the hosts were wonderful, the food amazing, and the coffee experience one of a kind.
wonderful new ethiopian restaurant in midtown phoenix!! familyowned by the husband and his wife who is the chef. i ordered the whole shebang. vegetarian platter was fantastic not too much food not too little! and then the attable coffee service. dont be shy here! the owner will help you pick whatever you like to eat and loves to share his culture with those new to ethiopian cuisine! super clean and friendly  dont miss out on this gem! perfect for friends or datenight or with the kiddos of course too.
delicious and fabulous food! what a great hidden find in central phoenix. the owner described the food choices to us and allowed us to make a vegetable and meat platter. the chickpeas, lentils and potato are delicious vegetarian choices. the chicken was so tender, i couldnt believe how delicious it was. the owners are so nice and friendly. its a very cute place to eat family style. bring lots of people as portions are reasonable!
i went here with my family and its one of our new favorites. per the recommendation of another yelper, we ordered the doto wat and awaze tibs. the doto wat was perfect for my 7yo and 3yo. a touch spicy for them but good for expanding their palette! if you like spicy, order the awaze tibs. my kids father and i fell in love with the dish, and i know i will be craving this dish for days to come!
this is a very good place. the food is delicious. price very much the same as the other ethiopian food restaurants. if you are in a hurry, call ahead of time.they are open 7 days a week.
this is really a fantastic restaurant. it has only been open a short amount of time, but the owners take a real sense of pride in their food and it really shows. check it out especially if you have never had ethiopian food, it is really tasty.
went here with my ethiopian coworker and i have never had ethiopian food and it was amazinggggg. i am from dallas and in town for work we have been trying to eat anything but chilis and fudruckers. this was awesome. the food ranges from no spice to spicy, with beef chicken and lamb dishes. there is an expansive vegetarian selection too. the food is served with a pancake looking bread called injara and its delish. eat here. you wont regret it. its authentic but not too much for people not used to eating ethnic food.
first time trying ethiopian foods this place was perfect. great service and atmosphere!
good food and nice place. i like the veggie combo it is big and tasty. i will be back.
i dont regularly leave reviews but this place was way too spectacular not to. the vibe in here is great and the food is...well theres just no words for it. super humble and helpful staff. the coffee ceremony was amazing and one of the most unique dining experiences ever.
i was really impressed with this place . the food was tasty, the service was absolutely delightful, and the atmosphere was very authentic. they even had ethiopian music on , which i thought was great, because im sick of going to foreign cuisine restaurants, and having to listen to the top 40 us music im a big music person, and i love all types of music, not just one kind thats forced on everyone. my favorite part was the ethiopian coffee serving !! it was super cool i dont want to say anymore , because you should experience it . the only thing i didnt love about the place is that it smelled a bit weirdstrong. im guessing thats due to the herbs that they use , so its really not a big deal, and i would definitely go back here ! : give it a try!!! its probably the best ethiopian food youll find in phoenix.
so this place was awesome.  its been a while since ive eaten ethiopian, and every time i eat it i wonder why i let anything get in between me and this delicious cuisine.my favorite thing about ethiopian, aside from the communal dining style, is the intentional and delicious vegetarian options.  we ordered a vegetarian combination the abyssinian vegetarian and a meat dish.  for four hungry adults we cashed out at about 40.  i also had the ethiopian tea, which was new to me, and not a favorite, but glad i tried it nonetheless.now, while the food was good, the service was exceptional.  one in our party has a strong gluten intolerance.  he called ahead and the restaurant made a special gluten free injera for him.  once we had arrived and ordered, they brought out and explained the unique injera they had prepared, no extra cost.  they also indicated that, given more advance notice a few days theyd be able to prepare it another way...maybe better?  i wasnt clear on the distinctions.  still, they were very accommodating.  they also helped us decide on what menu items to order.i hope to return here.  i was very pleased.  unlike the twostar reviews left for abyssinia, we were well fed and satisfied.
i cant recommend this place enough. i have gluten and dairy allergies and while they recommend you call in advance to make the gluten free ijara flatbread, i didnt know this and they catered to me anyway. my party split a vegetable sampler and a meat dish. the food was fantastic and super reasonable. if you have never tried ethiopian food you definitely need to experience.
outstanding! went there for lunch todaysaturday and were surprised we were the only ones in the place. ive eaten at every ethiopian restaurant in arizona and dozens of others across the country. so far this place is the best in az. hope they stick around for a long time.
absolutely wonderful! the food was amazing and our party of four split a veggie combo and a meat combo and couldnt finish it all. we brought home a huge carry out box full of food. we will definitely be going back.
these guys rock! anything, any size these guys will make it happen! shane is awesome, i wouldnt use anyone else for event or conference planning.
we have used vegas republik every time we visit las vegas and we receive vip treatment, but this past weekend they out did themselves.  my friends and i planned a last minute trip and called shane on the day we arrived.  as busy as the weekend was, shane and vrg was still able to manage to get us exactly what we wanted for every venue we attended. they came through in the clutch....wouldnt use anyone else or any other company!
my man shane and the entire vegas republik team always make sure we have the best time.  if you want the vip trip to vegas and you want the best deal, these are the guys to talk to.
we worked with shane and vegas republik recently for a bachelor party and he totally went out of his way to make sure our group was all set up. from the preplanning to meeting us at the club as we got out of the transportation that he arranged, he was on every detail. i will definitely be calling on shane and his group for my future vegas adventures. vegas republik is first class all the way.
fresh food, fun atmosphere, and friendly staff! the decor makes you feel like your near the beach waiting for the fish to be caught out back! best clam chowder ive ever had, the fries are perfectly seasoned and they offer a great variety of sauces. i cant wait to try the rest of the menu!
we just went here for lunch.   this place is wonderful!   friendly staff, great atmosphere and the most unbelievable food.   i cannot wait to go back and try some other menu items.    we just came back from a vacation in hawaii, and nothing we ate there was even remotely close to the quality and taste of this food.  thank you!
finally a fresh, healthy quick serve restaurant in south scottsdalei absolutely love the salmon and mahi mahi!  ive had both with their creamy butter sauce with brown rice and grilled zucchini, they were delicious. i definitely recommend the fish lettuce wraps, great twist on them especially with the butter lettuce.  i cant wait to try the grilled prawns next, such a great concept.
great!  we have needed a good seafood restaurant for a long, long time in scottsdale.  we lost our red lobster about a year ago with its mediocre servings and high prices, to be replaced by ahi mahi with its wide variety of fish plus others on its menu.  the dishes are huge you actually get the whole fish which is nice and thick and meaty; the sides are huge and deliciously prepared; the variety of sauces really bring out the flavor of the meal;  the service is fast and the people are very friendly .... all this for a very surprisingly low price.  a fast food concept that is much more.  their new facility is  modern, neat, clean and very inviting for dining in.  i had the grilled salmon 2 filets with creamy garlicbutter sauce over brown rice and mixed veges on the side; my wife had the swai a fish native to southeast asia, similar to our catfish, a humongous piece of fish of which she took half of it home, over brown rice and also mixed veges.  the meals were perfectly prepared and i would recommend anything that they serve.  their concept of providing a variety of sauces that they call flavors is such an innovation that i have never seen before as each sauce would turn your dish into anything from provencal to mexican .... i love it. we just returned from our annual trek to hawaii where i found the fish dishes to be rather blah compared to what i just had a ahi mahi.  we are going back with our friends and i would urge you to try it out and give these guys a boost in their new adventure.
awesome! ive been waiting for a place like this to open up! clean protein. fresh vegetables. brown rice. it is healthy, affordable, and has a great atmosphere. i will definitely be coming back for lunch again.
i had the java grilled salmon with grilled zucchini and brown rice. delicious and healthy.   also, good portions so i saved some for later. reasonably priced as well!
for fast, fresh, healthy... this place is great. tried the grilled mahi mahi with garlic, creamed corn, and grilled zucchini, yum!  the zucchini was sweet and smoky, the fish was done well and had great flavor, and it was all 10.  thank goodness this place replaced the pizza place going in, this is a great fast casual restaurant concept.
extremely flavorful, fresh taste, people are very friendly.
food is great! salmon and zucchini are amazing! food is prepared fairly quickly and a great substitute to chipotle haha. will definitely be a regular here.
this place is an absolute winner...great people, prices, food quality..a all the way around.  had the grilled mahi mahi, salad and grilled zucchini for 9.99 and it was better than most high end scottsdale eateries where you would pay three times that much! spoke with the ownermgr for quite awhile...very cool guy with a good business head...im thinking theyre here to stay...i wish them great success!
omg!!!  where do i start!  the service was incredible!  greeted and acknowledged when you step in the door!i have been there several times now, and it has only gotten better and better.  as if that were possible! i have had the tilapia, swai, and the white fish.  all were fresh, tasty, and perfectly grilled!  i had the tomato beans and the cole slaw as my sides.  the beans are perfectly cooked, not mushy, and the cole slaw was a great enhancement, without an over amount of dressing!  delectable!!!  and the clam chowder.......mouth watering good!i love everything about this place!  the food, the service, and pleasantries are a triple threat!this is my new place for fresh fish!  my search has ended!
the location of this restaurant has caused problems for previous businesses since its sandwiched between a chipotle and smashburger but ahi mahi fish grill should be here to stay.there are fairly limited options when it comes to finding fresh and flavorful fish in the scottsdale area unless youre willing to spend over 30 for a meal.this place is very affordable and their menu options are really all over the board.i ordered grilled mahi with the java sauce and it came with 2 sides, the grilled zucchini is so good and the seasonal veggies made it a healthy option.my roommate ordered the prawns and they didnt disappoint as well.all in all i would recommend this place to anyone that is craving seafood that they normally need to go to the coastal areas for.
i was really surprised at how nice this place was. the food was really good, reasonably priced, and the concept is really fun! im definitely coming here again, because i originally drove to this location for the smash burger next door; however seeing a fish type place looked more healthy and refreshing, and boy did it deliver! their sauces are amazing! and its a great place to sit down and chat with friends!
ahi mahi fish grill is definitely my go to fish restaurant.  every time we go it seems to get better and better.  i am one who likes to try everything offered on the menu.  this time i started with the clam chowder and found it delicious.  i ordered the cajun flavored swai in our terms blackened catfish with a side of house salad and their super tomatobean soup.  everything was prepared perfectly.  my wife had the chowder and what now has become her favorite, salmon with the creamy garlicbutter sauce, salad and the tb soup.  we have vowed to make this our friday night place to go.  p.s.  all the booths were filled this night which indicates that ahi mahi fish grill is really catching on.
i am a big fan of fish grill so i gave it a try. the food is very fresh, nice cook and the design looks co cool, that i havent seen from the similar restaurant. i like the fish and chicken, should try shrimp also. price is reasonable and service is good
my new favorite place! the best salmon i have ever had! and the prices arent too bad. the service is exceptional and the people are very nice.
one word delicious!  fresh, tasty, clean. nice facility and great service. yummy clam chowder. my 5 year old son said the broccoli is off the chain. i have no idea where he learned that, but for a kid who only eats fries and rice, enough said!!
this place is amazing!! i definitely recommend coming in! today and tomorrow all entrees are 50 off!
omg. this food is really really good. i love it. the staff are awesome. and the food is always always hottest fresh off the grill.hot fresh food and it is healthy awesome portions this is what fast food should be. i love the salmon it is so yummy. and it neat my salon jacksons hair boutique  so can call in an order and pic it up and be right back at the salon to service more clients. im from chicago and when i moved here there arent  a lot of fish markets to buy fish from so this cured my ill. always happy.  thanks ahi mahi
talk about a pleasant surprise! i was on my way to another restaurant when i discovered this new concept. its tucked between smashburger and chipotle, which is appropriate because its a similar fastcasual type place. except it features seafood!im an arizona native and i love seafood. its really a treat to find good seafood in the desert. its even more impressive to find fresh seafood in the desert for prices this reasonable! the variety of fish available swai, mahi mahi, salmon to name a few is different than most places.  choose your fish, choose a sauce and they grill it. there is a distinct emphasis on healthy choices and sides. speaking of sides, the coleslaw is really good. this is the first place ive enjoyed coleslaw made the way my mother prepared it... with raisins!i was half expecting to see fish tacos on the menu. as much as i love them, im glad they arent available. you can get fish tacos almost anywhere. this isnt a southwestmexican type restaurant. its more about the coast than a region. my only criticism about the menu, would be to expand the variety of seafood. i think i saw shrimp and scallops as appetizers. but it would be great to also have some clams or mussels. not much of a complaint really.the staff was helpful, made some good suggestions, and were very friendly. plus, the music was really hip. im glad this place is nearby to home and work. im definitely going to recommend this to my coworkers when we venture out next time. thank you for giving me another reason to avoid red lobster!
delicious! we just moved to the area and my boyfriend loves fish, so we thought wed try it out for lunch today. so glad we found this place! while im not a fish person, i got the beef and it was so good in a sweet sauce. he got the mahi mahi with cajun spice and pretty much inhaled it. love the quick, fresh feel of the place and will definitely be back!  he did mention that the portion of the fish was a little on the small side for the price, but i recall the menu saying it was wildcaught mahi mahi which i think is the reason and definitely makes it worth it.
love the grilled salmon with garlic butter. highly recommended!!
what a great find in the valley! you get a whole lot for your money. plus, everything that i have tried is great!
fish is was really fresh and cooked to the perfect temperature. seasoned just right. a lot of different sides to choose from. perfect healthy meal. ill be back!
had great experience. tried the grilled mahi mahi with brown rice its simply delicious.
great prices, and the food is solid and great portion sizes.
great value! so glad i decided to test them out.  healthy, flavorful and totally affordable!  hop this new place does well since i love the idea of eating freshly grilled fish for lunch.  girl at front manager, i believe!is also sweet and uses customer names. place is spotless and great seating avail too
delicious, fresh and a great value. im so happy to have a healthy and fast casual lunch spot available. welcome to the neighborhood!
an issue with the cash register was promptly resolved and the staff offered me a discount. besides this hiccup, the food is always great. i keep coming back a few times a month.
colada smoothie with peach yogurt is really good! i had the shrimp salad as well which was light and flavorful. will definitely be going back! i thought prices were reasonable for healthy organic ingredients, and for a restaurant in scottsdale.
yum!  delicious food... and i love the strawberry, kiwi mint smoothie..refreshing and unique.  i work at sugar sugar in the promenade and am thrilled to have a new restaurant here!  plus they deliver...huge bonus!  the owner seems to really care...and his staff is genuine and helpful.  great place!
best hummus hands dwn! my girl and i came in today and had a falafel sandwich awesome and hummus with pita bread.
i work in the area and i go to the promenade at least twice weekly.  i stumbled upon bowl of greens, and it was a delicious surprise.  there was another restaurant like this about a half of mile north i think it was called eating at raw  really not sure. it was a great restaurant, but it went out of business really fast.  they have great and affordable sandwiches, salads, and smoothies.  check it out.
walked in to a pleasant good morning. ordered a juice that was made perfect to my request.ordered breakfast which was delicious. the crew is helpful when ordering. cant wait to come in and try a salad or entree.
this is such a great place when you want a healthy meal. from the create your own salads to the delicious entrees, everything is delicious, healthy and fresh. the staff is always helpful and nice. the roasted veggies are so good i crave them daily now if i could just stop craving all of the sweets too!!.
ive been waiting for a place like this to open in my neighborhood. the salads are fantastic, and every additional item i try from the surprisingly extensive menu has been really good. smoothies, yes; very good. roasted veggies; excellent. i plan to keep working my way through the menu, even the breakfast items. the place is very bright and clean, and the staff is very nice. my one criticism is that some staff members are a little stingy with the salad ingredients, even the greens. but i ask for more, and they comply. five stars for sure.
first time  deluxe pita with chicken and berry blast smoothie. im not a fan of pita chips that comes with the burrito. but both items i ordered were great.
very fresh salad made in front of you. you can choose or custom your own salad. i took one with salmon, cook was perfect not to dry. first experience ok.
super yummy! i got pita chips with hummus and a chicken cedar wrap. fresh! the staff were very helpful since it was my first time there.
love this place! local and family owned.  the fresh juice bar has a great selection and is priced just right. their salad bar is perfect, i love the large selection of fresh produce to choose from. there are numerous dressings to choose from too! you can add a protein to your salad of choice. they also have hot lunch items such as the chicken kabob which is pretty tasty. they have only been open for a few weeks now so theyre still learning the ropes; however the staff is very friendly. a must try!
this place is super clean . i created my own salad which i thought i would screw up but  to my surprise it was really good . i will definitely go back service was good and low key . sometimes places try to hard where it is annoying . plus they had stevia for a sweetener .owner was working . apparently they are opening another location .i can see why ! plus it was appropriately priced .people always tend to complain about prices .as a small business owner some people dont know the cost of having quality products .
i had make your own salad. im looking forward to coming back to try several other items on the menu. it all looks delicious. they make healthy fresh smoothies. the serve breakfast also.
healthy, fast, fresh and friendly owners. lunch was affordable and delicious. will definitely return.
i got a make your own salad and was pleasantly surprised with the big portion size of the salad and the amount of yummy chicken on there. it actually fills you up and leaves you satisfied unlike some of the other salads you find in scottsdale! would highly recommend their house dressing and pita chips!
just had my hair done, what a fantastic job. actually i just wanted a haircut, but after seen myself in the mirror looked like i had a helmet  harsh looking, i decided to go all out.  lupita went over all my options, suggested changes, hair cut  and made me feel comfortable enough to go for iti am so happy of the outcome, i wish i had taken a before and after pix. the highlights are there, but subtle, the cut is perfect for my face and for my active lifestyle. and the best part, my husband likes it.thank you lupita, well done.
i just recently moved to the area and found lupita. she has done an awesome job in doing highlights on my hair and keeping my roots in check.
great place to get your haircut, highlights or anything else! the service is impeccable, the salon is very clean and well organized and the staff is amazing! lupita always does an amazing job! definitely worth the try!
give me a s. give me an o. give me an u. give me a p. what that spells? soup!!! what? soup! what? soup! what? soup! cant hear you? soup!!!!!on a curiously warm october evening, the little yelp gang made our little way across the city to meet up at this unassuming very quiet taiwanese restaurant, too quiet even, for a bowl of soup. for soup, really? yeah. not any kind of soup, a bowl of authentic beef noodle soup.once we received our deliciously looking bowl of hot soup, we knew we were in for a fucking awesome treat. you could already tell by the lovely smell hitting our nostrils. and of course, after that spoonful of broth before plunging in was all it needed to reassure.how good is it? the broth is extremely intense. it has that very homey feel, the kind of soup your mom or grandma would cook up on a very very cold winter night. broth is made with beef bones and by simmering it long enough, you get the bone marrow that falls off and adds a whole other level of richness to the broth. you could definitely taste the gelatinous marrow and the fat.not only is the broth insane, the beef is fork tender fall apart kind of but still holds together to be pick up.besides the soup, we had a shredded pork and corn cake as well as some pineapple fill cookie.the cake was moist, not too heavy and quite tasty. as for the cookie, crumbly exterior similar to shortbread and the pineapple candy filling added enough moisture to make it very enjoyable.in short, insanely good broth that makes you want to swim in it, take it home, bottle it so you can use it as perfume. lovely owners welcoming you into their home basically. hidden gem in ville stlaurent. deserves plenty of love!ps. the complimentary tea is lovely. the roasted rice is what gives it that extra oomphwarmth
price is fair, food is delicious! where to start? the lady owner cooks her broth for 5 hours to get it ready  thats dedication! while my colleagues got the beef noodle soup and were almost dying over it from pleasure guys!, i got the vegetarianvegan option: sweet and sour soup and  a dish of udon noodles with veggies. everything was so tasty ...and the udon noodles  woah, delicious, flavourful, the whole thing tastes real aromas  not fake ones like it could be often the case sometimes! even veggies felt fresh and crunchy. i had indeed a lot of pleasure eating at this little restaurant. they also have nice little cookies with lightly sweeten pineapple in the inside with pineapple that doesnt taste canny!. i would go again for their authentic food, great service the owner is quite talkative and funny  and the fair price. by the way, they do 4 broths during the holidays: mango, nuts, beef and cranberry cant remember for sure about this one!. anyway, bon appetit if you go!
went here last night with a small group of yelp friends, people generally smarter than me about authentic taiwanese food. all i knew was it had been chilly and felt like fall and i was craving soup, and man did this tiny hole in the wall deliver. we were the only ones in there on a tuesday night, and the young couple who own the place and make all the food from scratch seemed perplexed but happy we were there, and eventually we got them to come out and chat with us and they were so funny and dear and great. we all ordered the beef noodle soup that bozan x had told us about, except for the representative from the land of vegetarian who was well taken care of as well, but will no doubt tell her own story. the soup was just outstanding. broth that takes 5 hours to simmer to glorious savoury perfection, beef thats falling apart tender, crunchy veg and incredible homemade noodles that i could eat daily. i might go back this weekend for the mooncakes, and around christmas for all the different cakes the mama chef so proudly told us tales of, and ill be back before then many times for sure to sooth away the winter chill with these lovin spoonfuls.
i go there once in a while to get their home made pineapple cakes. so genuinely taiwanese and definitely the best you can find in montreal. other small eats such as onigiri japanese triangle rice roll and zongzi chinese sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaves are also great. havent had a chance to have meals there. will try next time.
my parents live in the area so we decided to drop by for lunch on a cold sunday. the restaurant is tiny. we were the only ones there at first but the place filled up quickly after our arrival. the owner was extremely outgoing and friendly, going out of his way to explain the menu and taiwanese culture to us in lots of detail. he enthusiastically told us he was trained by a local celebrity chef in taiwan and showed us the recipes she had published in a magazine. our conversation really piqued our curiosity and by then we were impatient to sample his cuisine. it definitely did not disappoint. the menu is half taiwanese and half japanese. we tried the taiwanese beef noodle soup, which consisted of perfectly al dente udonlike noodles chilling in a deep, rich beef broth; the heavenly taiwanese minced pork rice, which tasted like it had been simmering in its juices for hours; crispy japanese almond shrimps; sweet and sour deep fried fish, and some kind of chicken katsu, although the sauce tasted a bit more like teriyaki than the traditional plum sauce. everything was fresh and flavorful, and the fried food was surprisingly not oily at all. i personally preferred the taiwanese dishes because it tasted like the kind of homecooked meals you yearn for once youve left the family nest, but i must admit the fried dishes were very well executed and would delight any tempura fan.we finished the meal with a sample of the pancakes that are only offered on weekends: taro, sweet potato, custard and red bean. it was the perfect end to a very enjoyable lunch. i really admired how passionate the owners seemed, and thought it really showed in their cooking. we will definitely be back.
we came here recommended by a friend to try out their authentic taiwanese beef soup and boy did that recommendation deliver!! im licking my licks just thinking of this place. if i ever find myself in this area anytime between october to april, i will be here to warm up my bones with that awesome soup! the serving size is generous and the pricetag is very reasonable.the staff is a couple and are very welcoming and eager to please. the gentleman left a very positive impression on me. the place is small yet has that nice homely feel to it, theyre a relatively new business and i hope word gets out, this place should be filled with patrons.i had a few other things but they truly paled to comparison to this great soup! if i ever find myself in the area, i have to go back in!
this is such a great restaurant. a family run resto with  a variety of asian dishes. the food is delicious and the prices are extremely reasonable. one of my favourite places in the city.
this restaurant really cares about their customers! great service, great food, super nice people and they dont use msg in case youre wondering.
ive been here twice in the past month.  the place is run by a husbandwife and has been opened for about two years.  i appreciate how they take the time to explain where the food comes from and how they use their home made recipes.  the beef noodle soup is excellent.  i am told they boil the broth for hours and use applesfruits to add flavour rather than msg.  if you go on the weekend, they serve this delicious custard pancake.  use the paper bag when eating the pancakes as it can get quite messy.
what a beautiful and chic location. this place is gorgeous. i had great customer service and am very happy with their products! they are very knowledgeable and helpful. the prices are amazing too. i had an underarm laser done and there was no pain at all. definitely worth it!
i have had consult in many places for laser hair removal. if you want a combination of great customer service, high end, extremely clean and chic location and an affordable price, you got your jackpot! i had a wonderful experience in this place. they have barely started business but im sure they will go big in town! so glad found this place
absolutely amazinghardworking staff! extremely quick, yet careful session. definitely a thumbs up.
by far the nicest laser hair removal studio in las vegas. ive tried them all! staff was so courteous, professional, and knowledgable. the place is immaculate, clean, modern, and beautiful!! the prices are unbeatable for what you get with the latest and best technology. it barely hurt and has a cooling burst so you dont feel it. i see results already and  feel so safe going to a place that really takes time to know the clients needs and history.
today i had an underarm treatment at simply skin and it was amazing! the salon is gorgeous,clean and chic. anahit is incredibly kind and knowledgable i highly recommend trying them out!
extremely professional service with state of the art laser equipment. great selections of skin products to try and also doterra essential oils. the owner is gracious and very concerned about customer satisfaction. their prices are very reasonable compared to other places in town that offer similar services. the place has a calming feel and you do not feel  like you are being rushed through a salon factory. the focus is you. i love that. will definitely be coming back and referring my friends here.
anahit is undeniably the most thorough, professional  knowledgeable tech i have experienced.  she is honest and looks out for your best interest.  the laser treatment was comfortable for me no pain and the cool burst was a huge bonus for my comfort.  i love love love that she used a white liner to grid my areas so she wouldnt miss any spots.  i just have so many nice things to say that i could go on and on.  check out simply skin and you will not be disappointed!  i went on a referral from a friend and i am thrilled that i went especially because i had a bad experience with another local laser hair removal company here in town.  lastly the other part that i loved is that she doesnt just schedule out every 4 weeks, she has different time frames for rebooking depending on the area treated.  for instance i return after 6 weeks for my braziilan and underarms,  whereas the nape of my neck is 4 weeks.  this to me was what made me realize how professional she was in knowing the patterns of how quick hair grows back in the different areas and she books accordingly instead of just booking a generic every 4 weeks!
if you are looking for laser hair removal this is your place! i have wanted to do this for years and i never did because i thought it would hurt and it was too expensive. i found simply skin las vegas, and im so glad i did! its beautiful, modern, easy to get to, reasonably priced and the staff is so incredibly kind and knowledgeable! i have had my whole body done and im already seeing results! i cant believe i waited this long shaving all these years, actually i am glad i did because i may have never found simply skin las vegas.
this place is amazing, and the interior is welcoming. anahit made me feel so comfortable, and was very honest with me. if youre interested in laser hair removal this is the place to go. i know i will keep going back.
this place is absolutely amazing. they are very friendly and professional. if your looking for a place to go this is the place and has amazing pricing.
just went back for my second round today. i had my underarms done again and my brazilian laser for the first time. my underarms are doing great and i love not having to shave every day anymore. the laser on my brazilian was painless and im so happy i got it done. love, love, love this place!
got laser hair removal on my legs. anahit was amazing! i didnt feel any pain. i cant wait to see results. will definitely be coming back.
it was time for my next laser hair removal session but i was on the road traveling.  i know how important it is to keep up with my sessions on a timely manner so i had to do a quick review of the laser hair removal spas in lv.  i checked out two places in the area before making an appointment at simply skin.  i knew when i drove up to the spa that i had found my laser spot in vegas.  although i have had previous treatments, i was given a thorough consultation staff is very knowledgeable and that helped further put me at ease knowing i was in good hands.  the treatment was painless and went by like a breeze.  the spa is very welcoming but most importantly it is super clean and the retail selection is a fun addon.  i purchased the bon bliss body scrubs and i love them. hint: buy the scrub and use them a few days after your laser treatment and it will help make the dead hairs fallout easily and keeps your skin smooth.im actually looking forward to my next treatment at simply skin.  thumps way up.
i love the environment and energy. everyone is very nice and knowledgeable.i am one who often has a lot of questions, and rather than anahit getting frustrated, she was very patient and answered each an every question.i recommend simply skin, not only because they are professional, knowledgeable, and extremely nice, but also because their prices are great!
im excited to say that simply skin las vegas exceeded my expectations. the staff is friendly and caring, the prices are reasonable, and the quality of the services is optimal. as far as im concerned, nothing supersedes that. i have recommended this establishment to all my friends and colleagues in the las vegas area and cannot wait to return myself in a few weeks.  a special thank you to anahit who has turned customer service into a science. bravo!
from the minute you walk in, you are welcomed  and pampered. anahit and mari are both very professional yet fun to be around. i am in the beauty industry myself and appreciate meticulous professionals like myself. many complications can arise from improper laser treatments, so make sure you pick a place  technician that knows what theyre doing. for me its simply skin.
favorite place... i wouldnt go anywhere else : best in vegas!!!!!!!! anahit is the best at laser. made me feel super comfortable and explained everything i needed to know about the laser. cant wait to use the other fancy machine. i even convinced my boyfriend to get laser done!  highly recommend this place!!!!!!!
pleasantly surprised by the decor. this place is so nicely decorated and appealing for both men and women. my boyfriend loved the place as much as i did. great furniture. it looks better in person than in the photos posted. theyre open late and stayed even later for me because we are getting ready to travel and didnt want to miss my treatment window. this place is a gem. glad i found it. my boyfriend will be getting treatments, too, when we are back.
i went in to simply skin las vegas to buy a gift card for a friend and ended up getting a consultation and treatment for myself while i was there. the staff is very personable and i was pleasantly surprised to see the menu of services and products available for men. will be going back soon.
this place is amazing! anahit is so sweet and knowledgeable! ive had many laser treatments from other places and they cant compare to this place at all! simply skin is so cute with there design, so clean,  and they make you feel so comfortable. plus the best, part no pain!highly recommend!!!
such an amazing  experience.. i was referred by a friend. anahit was so welcoming and sweet! she explained everything in detail and answered all my questions . i got my first treatment today, i did my underarms.. it didnt even hurt! my best friend and boy friend are going to get some services done as well.. the decor is totally posh, beverages amazing! perrier ! i was sold! seriously this is the best place.. dont go anywhere else! call today! consultation is free! only thing you have to lose is hair!!
i heard about these amazing ladies through a coworker! i have always considered having laser done but was very nervous! i first went in to have a consultation! they were so welcoming , knowledgable , friendly and best of all so very affordable! today i had my first session and i was very excited to have it done! the pain is nothing like you would imagine! it feels like a cold burst of air. i had my bikini done , which is a fairly sensitive area, and i barely felt a thing! i would normally never believe anyone who said it didnt hurt but believe me anyone can do this!! i cant wait to start seeing results and will definitely be back and doing more areas of my body!! highly recommended !! thank you both so very much
absolutely love this place, and i have already recommended simply skin to many of my friends, and family! ive been to several laser places before and none of them were as welcoming as simply skin. they really made me feel so comfortable from the moment i walked in. they answered every single question i had, and were very patient in the process during the consultation and actual appointment.the place was very clean, and you could easily tell that sanitation is a top priority for them.i could easily tell that anahit and mari are truly passionate about what they do, as they have thought out every single detail to make the experience as welcoming, fun and as smooth as possible! best part is it was painless the prices are totally affordable!!
simply skin las vegas is the perfect combination of professional and comfortable. their equipment is state of the art, and the personal attention is topshelf. anahit, the owner and operator, has a passion for the business and she takes it seriously. i like that.. its clear that she wants the maximum positive outcome and is honest relative to the process and how each client has a unique combination of factors that impact the service. going in, i really didnt know much about this type of service, and i felt after the consult very confident and informed. the pricing is ultracompetitive, and when you factor in the luxury level of personal service, its nothing short of a bargain. if you are considering this type of service, i cant imagine a better place to go.
love every minute while my boyfriend and i are at simply skin. from the chic environment to the exceptional, professional, and friendly service. anahit and mari treat you like family orwhile providing expert treatments.my boyfriend and i recently moved here from the pacific northwest and came to realize you wear a lot less clothing here. and felt the need to get hair removal. looked into a few places but after entering the simply skin establishment and meeting anahit i knew this was the place.only had a few treatments and already so happy with results. but cant wait to finish our treatments for our more permanent results!!! neither of us felt any pain!!  so excited to no longer have to worry about under arm or bikini when going to the gym or a pool party. and my boyfriend so excited to wear whatever he wants to the gym tank tops with his treatments on chestback, and of course ready to go for those last minute pool parties.  no matter your lifestyle why not make you life a little easier and one less step to get ready. i would recommend simply skin to anyone. also cant wait to try the ematrix machine :
i cant say enough amazing things about this place. i fly to vegas weekly for work and the weekends i stay here...simply skin is my guilty pleasure! the ladies anahit and mari are not only great at what they do but they make you feel so welcomed. service is outstanding...the prices are unbeatable. anahit spent a good amount of time with my consultation. i am not always comfortable with getting laser treatment but i was so comforted with her knowledge and honesty. i am seeing great results from my treatments. her machine is top notch and shes a perfectionist so shes really thorough. when i leave other laser places i always think...well i hope they got it all...but with her i never even thought about it because i know she did. one last added bonus about this place is how clean, neat and absolutely beautiful it is.
today i got laser hair removal done for the first time on my legs! i was so nervous about the pain but once they started it wasnt bad at all. like people say the pain is all in your head and it seriously was! the laser technicians were so friendly and didnt make me uncomfortable at all! i honestly felt so welcomed and safe. i have finally found the perfect place to get rid of all the unwanted hair forever!!
i have never done laser hair removal before until today! anahit, the owner was awesome! she went over everything i needed to know and answered all questions. i went for my underarms and my main concern was if there was pain. she did one test spot and i was truly amazed! some other areas were a little tender but it was so quick. i was done with both under arms in minutes! it was red for a little bit and i continued with my day... quick,great prices, great customer service, i love supporting local las vegas businesses!!!  definitely a must try for any hair removal
i cannot say enough good things about this place. from the minute you walk in the ambiance is very clean and inviting. anahit is amazing! i trust her judgment completely. after a couple of treatments using ematrix my tone, texture, and scarring have greatly improved. my csection scar has substantially diminished. im so pleased with the results ive made an appointment for laser hair removal the next time i go in. i highly recommend their services.
painless treatment... i couldnt believe it! must visit simply skin las vegas
great vibe, great prices, great gift options for the holidays. simply and amazing experience...simply skin is simply great
look no further for your goto laser salon! i fly from la to las vegas just to get my laser done with anahit here. we all know the whole experience of getting laser hair removal can give you a bit of anxiety! first, you have to take your clothes off in front of a stranger, but anahit makes you feel so at ease! her professionalism and her welcoming attitude are all you need to wind down and relax. after your initial consult with her, you feel like youve known her forever. then comes the stress of actually getting lasered... is it going to hurt? is it working? does this person know what shes doing?!?! rest assured... dealing with anahit means youre probably dealing with the most knowledgable laser professional out there! i probably bombarded her with questions, and she answered everything clearly and thoroughly. then i came to find out her laser equipment is the best one out there... i was sold!ive always been wary of getting lasered and seeing no results, or seeing spots missed. well, my results couldnt get any better! ive never seen a stray hair, and i saw a noticeable difference after my first session. now i have skin softer than a babys butt!you seriously cant go wrong with simply skin. im eternally devoted to anahit and her team! thank you, ladies!
i started going to simply skin because their prices were great but stayed a customer because of their outstanding service. the quality and attention to detail exceeds my standards. the place is gorgeous, and the staff are knowledgeable and patient with questions and making sure im comfortable with my treatments. their boutique has a lot of products that have healthy ingredients.
outstanding!!i am so happy with the results and the staff explained everything in detail and were so patient with me!thank you
super knowledgeable and they make you feel comfortable. great experience and will definitely be returning for my next session!
we unexpectedly stumbled upon this place because we went to eat next door, and loved the place. they have reserved parking out front, a wonderful chic location, and great service.
fantastic service at incredible prices. anahit is wonderful. bring all your friends. friendly staff and very knowledgeable.
i did not get any actual service done but i am giving this place 5 stars because of the exceptional customer service that i received during my consultation. i wanted to have hair removed from my underarms and so i came over, filled out my paperwork and when i was done, anahit went through them. i was impressed. most places ask you to fill out the paperwork but dont really bother reading them. anahit read the things that i wrote down, asked me some questions about it and told me what she thought. she said that they just recently opened and would love to take my money if i decide to get the service done anyway but she said that she would rather send me away and not do the procedure at all. she explained that typically it takes at least 68 visits and then 6 weeks in between visits for most body parts to be treated again because thats how long hair grows back and that was something that i had to seriously consider. she also explained the impact of hormones in hair growth. anahit and mari are both very knowledgeable and helpful. these days, its hard to find people who genuinely care and dont just wanna take your money. they are new in the business and i think that they will be very successful and i wish them all the best for their future! cheers!
came to this place to buy elta md sunscreen and was pleasantly surprised with their laser hair removal prices, the machine they have, and their customer service.
went to simply skin las vegas on the recommendation of a friend and im very glad i did. as a man, not very many places in town made me feel as comfortable as the ladies here. check them out.
cannot say enough good words about simply skin.everyone needs to go!!!all my fears were for nothing. beautiful studio, professional and friendly staff and the treatment was quick, cheap and painless. cannot recommend enough!!
i was soooo nervous but anahit  mari made me feel comfortable it was a quick n easy process. they are super nice and explain everything to you. excited to see the results!
i have been to two other laser hair salons and this one is by far the best! simply skin has the best prices and the nicest staff. i loved that anahit was very honest with everything she does and didnt want me to expect something she could not offer me. she made me feel comfortable the entire time, and to be honest, her machine was much less painful than the machines used at the two other salons ive gone to. highly recommend simply skin!!!
i almost never write reviews because i always forget. but the ladies here at simply skin have been so great to me, so i have to let the yelp community know. theyre so professional and friendly as well. i dont feel like walking into a medical building where the environment feels cold. you can tell they put a lot of love into their profession and that they really have a passion for what they do. you can always count on them to look after your best interest. they are also just amazing people overall. i feel like i really gained a relationship with them and they make me feel like im always coming back to get layered by friends. ive never had any connection with any waxer, hair dresser, etc. so with that being said, i really hope this small business continues to be as great as it has been because they deserve it.
i cant say enough good things about this place! she is very knowledgeable and really takes the time to make you feel comfortable. i just had my first treatment and it wasnt painful at all! the salon is beautiful and its very affordable. i will definitely refer everyone here!
simply skin is your onestop shop for everything you need for your laser hair removal needs. anahit, the owner, is not only knowledgable about the procedures, but also extremely personable and passionate about what she does. she guided me through the process and made sure that the procedure was safe to do. the consultation was fast and easy, and im on the third treatment for my neck and back. im 100 satisfied with anahits work and refer all my friends and family to her!
anahit and marta are by far the best at what they do. i love that they make me feel comfortable and walk me through everything they do. cant thank them enough for their services.
you owe it to yourself to be treated at simply skin las vegas. im so excited to be writing this review because it was love at first walkin! not only is it a beautifully decorated salon with a chic ambience, the atmosphere created by all of the employees is so fun to be around. anahit did my consultation. she was incredibly knowledgeable in answering all my questions and so thorough with her work.  mari, one of the laser technicians, lasered me during my first appointment. i decided to start small to test the waters so i only made an appointment for an underarm treatment. they were so sweet and so precise that i immediately bought a package for the rest of my underarm treatments and added a brazilian  package because these prices are unbeatable! it pleasantly surprised me to know that at simply skin las vegas, no matter who you deal with, its going to be an amazing experience. side note: i have been lasering, waxing, plucking, and doing anything else you can think of for years and their prices are the best and so are their machines!!
i was nervous to go thru any hair removal procedure but from the moment i walked in i felt so comfortable. the customer service is simply amazing and their office is beautiful.  i almost dont want to leave! all your my questions were answered and you can tell they put attention at the most little details. beautiful place!
my friend recommended this place, so i  travelled all the way to vegas from la just to see anahit. she is the best. during the consultation she patiently answered all my questions and concerns, and the procedure was painless. i love my soon to be forever smooth skin!
ok lets be real, is anyone really excited about hair removal of any kind? waxing, tweezing, shaving, threading, sugaring... im over it!  i love simply skin!!! ive been to other laser hair removal offices before and they are .... okay, at best. and thats all i will say about that.  anahit is an absolute blessing!  mari is the sweetest person youll ever meet!i still have a few months left with these ladies, thank goodness.  they are absolute professionals and a true joy to be around.  they care about your comfort and dont make you feel awkward ever.  and lets face it... some areas arent so exciting, if you know what i mean!  the laser that simply skin uses is the latest technology in hair removal and honestly a fraction of the pain. i have no down time after treatments and the results so far have been worth every penny!  and id be spending hundreds more anywhere else.  i cant say enough amazing stuff about these two lovely ladies and their business.  if you are looking for laser hair removal this is the only place to be!!
great place.  was oracle before they just moved buildings. this place is way nicer and  they dont have that stupid bar design in the middle of the place! ill go to this place just for the beautiful  bartender with the tattoos!
this place is wicked! saturday night was insane. i was in town for the weekend and a friend suggested embassy. i usually dont leave the strip when i go to vegas but this was worth it. would totally go back.
awesome little place! the management is on point, and everyone was really nice. a change of pace from the strip places, it does get packed but its locals. this could potentially be a place to meet someone etc. great job, i wish them all the success, i just moved from lv but ill be back to visit.
if you are looking for a strip experience but off the strip, then you found the place! great bottle prices for a great experience! drinks prices are very reasonable and valet is available! very much recommended!
one thing we always do on our trips to vegas is look for places that play latin music not always easy to find! this time we got a recommendation from our old friend dj low who we met in long beach all those years ago it was great seeing him again he is so coolwhat a nice place! on a thursday night, the place was jumpin with great music and dancing. they play all the latino genres plus even un poquito hiphop. i would say the age range is mid20s and up, not a kiddie bar which is nice. plus we also got a live show from fulanito! weve liked the blue martini on thursday nights before, but unlike that place this is a real latino nightclub. we will be back and spread the word to our friends in lalb who like to party. cant wait!
everyone that works here is just flat out hot. good service. prices make sense for the level of nightclub you get without being on the strip. go early. gets packed. and you get the light show when you buy a tbl
great place to meet the hottest locals in las vegas, including that 50 girl you want to take home with the big booty.
want a great staff, great music and a party atmosphere without the price of the strip? then this is the spot to go to. staff is always on point, as is the music. at first this is just a club to go drink, party, and have a good time but the more and more you come here, you will start to feel as if the staff is part of your family. going here will soon begin to feel like a family reunion that you actually want to be at. so if u want just another club experience where you just a face in the crowd then go somewhere else. if u want to a club experience but getting treated like family and friends by the staff then hit up embassy because i promise u guys wont b disappointed.
first time at this establishment last night. i truly have to say such an amazing place. my fiance  i celebrated his 35th bday here. the staff is so curtious and constantly checking on you to make sure your ok  dont need anything security is on top of there game, servers were so professional. i nothing but positive things to say of this establishment . we will definitely be visiting this location again on our visits to vegas.
nice venue!!!! its a latin hip hop club! i like the way the dj went from hip hop to cha cha! everyone here comes to dance so make sure you have on the right shoes!they also have hookah, if thats youre thing. the bar and waitresses were nice to, also not bad on the eyes either!!!
i love it here, i was welcomed as soon as i got in. had to get a waitress to help with hookah but she was super sweet and sat us at table. my and my gfs ran to the bar and grabbed drinks from benjamin, super nice guy. other than that, beautiful place, good latin music, z the owner showed us around and made us feel important. loved it. would recommend locals and friends from out of town here. thank you guys!! just found out renee is our beautiful server, she is amazing!! thank you
expert staff, great atmosphere! im glad a decent supplement shop moved into my neighborhood!
very professional and knowledgeable. spoke woth the manger there who actually took the time to explain everything how best to optimise your wookout, supplements everything. very impressed. of course you could find all your sbit cheeper online but without the knowledge base your money is wasted. quality over quantity.
i absolutely love this place!  kristine is amazing at what she does and made me feel so comfortable. i have been skeptical about getting a brazilian or letting anyone wax my eyebrows after a previous bad experience at a big chain wax center, but my friend goes kristine and reassured me she was amazing.   first i needed to book my appointment. i am very busy and between my screaming kids and work meetings, sometimes phone calls arent exactly in the cards.  my friend informed me that i could just book my appointment online whenever i had a minute. what a relief!  i got a text message the day prior to my appointment to remind me. when i arrived at the center it was very easy to find her room. they have a big electrical board when you walk in that has the business name and room number on it. i made my way down to norse skin and was greeted by kristine. she went over my expectations and concerns. she walked me through what we were going to be doing on my eyebrows to make sure that she fully understood what i wanted. she made some suggestions and we got down to business!  my brows turned out amazing!  she showed me where i needed to let my hair grow in a little bit more to even them out after the butcher job i received at the place i went to before. my brazilian was relatively painless, and quick!  she uses a hardwax so it hurts a lot less and it is also healthier for my skin. she was very professional and we had great conversation throughout my whole waxing experience so it was not awkward at all a previous concern of mine. kristine walked me through my after care which was super informative. i am prone to ingrown hairs so she gave me an athome regime to follow to help combat that. i have to say, i do not have one ingrown to date! i will definitely be returning to kristine in a few weeks for my next wax.  i would definitely recommend her to my friends and family because she is amazing and i get a discount for every referral...even better!if you are looking for a professional waxer who cares about her clients skin, then kristine at norse skin is the gal to see!
kristine is awesome! shes super friendly and really quick, which if youve ever had a serious wax is a very important asset! highly recommend all of her services!
quick and painless! easily the best wax ive gotten. i came to norse skin care for a brazilian, which i was nervous about. fortunately, kristine is very kind, friendly and makes you feel super comfortable. she used hard wax, which is so much quicker and easier on the skin than the strips most waxers use  she removed everything with ease and never had to go over certain spots more than once. the wax went by so fast, i was both pleased and surprised. if youre looking for a great place to get waxed, this is the place to go. i definitely will be returning here for all future waxes!
so i was looking for a waxer close to my soontobe home, and i ended up finding this tiny gem  inside sola salon! kristine is awesome!!!! shes extremely warm, easy going, and extremely professional. she gets the job done incredibly fast. also, i love that i can just schedule my session online. shes great at confirming, and ive never had a scheduling issue. ive been to several wax spots in town. i am happy to report that kristine, by far, provides the best value! she has an amazing loyalty program, which you have to ask her about. im so excited to have found her.
ok, this place is sensory overload for me, seriously. so, so, so many cool things for people who basically live to play in the kitchen, like me. being that its hilldale and the store name sounds a bit snooty, i didnt expect to find affordable items here. surprise! their prices are not outrageous, even for the high end things, and they have a ton of stuff on clearance. so many fun and truly useful gadgets that cooking geeks will truly appreciate. a huge stateoftheart kitchen in the rear of the store welcomes you in to browse around and sign up for classes if you like. very friendly, easygoing staff.
fun place to go. if you like to cook this is a one stop shop. for common and specialty cooking ware very friendly and knowledgable. clean neat and organized. we go there few times a month. they have product on the low end of cost to the high end
my new favorite ayce in town! they just opened not long ago. atmosphere is very open and cool. come check it out they have great food and service! :
im pretty picky when i eat out but this place really hits the spot. they just opened not long ago and their food and service is very good. im definitely coming back! thanks chef! thanks sushi way!
bomb ass sushi and ono is a must!
i got all you can eat here. i love the omg roll  its so good... sushi chef is very nice. love this place already :
i really love this place!! i usually go to yama ive been loyal to yama for 11 years but that place has seriously outgrown that spot waiting for a seat at lunch at 2pm on a monday ....just me....seriously?. as a result i decided to give sushi way a shot. its only been open a couple weeks but i work nearby and fellow coworkers have said positive things.... i went by myself and tried a few things, not a single meh it was all delicious! i went back again the other day and tried more rolls i love that they incorporate coconut into their tempura and rollsyum! i tried the bacon wrapped scallops bite size and perfect. coconut shrimp tempurayum! screaming orgasmcreamy and delish! seared white tuna, garlic tuna yum yum! snow white rollperfectly savory! and i tried 3 other half rolls two had sexy in the name but i dont remember the other no matter what, you just cant go wrong. the service was awesome, they didnt miss a beat. food was on point. its close to my work. i dont believe it gets any better.... oh wait, it does! they have stamp cards for a.y.c.e. yes indeedy, im one happy lady!
this restaurant feels good from the moment you walk in. the staff is wonderful, fast and friendly. the food is very well prepared and reasonably priced. the whole restaurant is immaculately clean and inviting. i highly recommend...
new place just opened up a couple weeks ago. closest sushi place near my office. really happy that the sushi is good quality. the sex bomb roll was delicious. i will be assembling my crew and returning very soon. :
absolutely the best sushi in vegas. support the small restaurant not the casino! everyone here has shown genuine passion for the food they served me. this is without a doubt my favorite place ive eaten in this city.
sooo delicious! theyre all you can eat is the best ive had in vegas! you have to try the coconut shrimp tempura  the sexy lazy roll.. the staff is great, super friendly :
value: 5 stars. for two of us around 57. my girlfriend is not a big eater, so i ate my share and half hers. at other sushi joints id usually order the sushi dinner and share a few rolls...which exceeds the price paid at sushi wayquality: 5 stars. i ordered three pokes because they were so damned tasty. all of the fish was fresh, sauces tasty and all assembled with great care and presentation. they dont try to fill you up with rice...they try to fill you with expensive fish at a fixed rate.service: 5 stars. ploy was our waitress and she had the cutest little accent and personality. she was so friendly and encouraged us to order more at any time and kept coming back to check on us. ive been to other places that are so bottom line driven and nazi about everything. you have rice left, no more sushi for you!. it felt like a mutual respect relationship where as long a we kept eating, they kept serving. they dont have a liquor license yet. tip 1 bring in your own alcohol, and bring your receipt. the sushi chef was really cool and said he would allow that. only problem is the nearest liquor was a long ways away....and we didnt have a car. atmosphere was great. 10pm on a monday night and we were the only one in there until two couples later showed up. food came out really fast at first, but as other patrons arrived, the chef got bogged down a bit which just meant we had to order multiple items sooner. only bad, this is towards the end of our meal it got super freezing in there so we have to take turns going outside to warm up. another thing is it got really salty towards the end and we were really thirsty on the walk to our hotel.
awesome place in vegas. this sushi restaurant is just opened few weeks ago. i like the atmosphere of the restaurant. the sushi chef and p.k are so nice. definitely, their fish was fresh and excellent. i love their seared super white tuna sashimi. i should go again soon.
one word. good!i highly recommend this restaurant! ayce but a lar carte quality! all other all you can eat restaurants are use everything frozen and looks like junk food. but this restaurant is totally different than other japanese restaurant. you will see how they have good qualities of food when you enter this nice restaurant. also nice services!:
excellent in every way. close to work, which is great. very quick, strong service which is a huge exception to your average ayce place. the sushi nachos are bomb. only suggestion is more rolls with that tasty orgasm sauce!
im always skeptical about ayce japanese restaurants but this amazing new kid on the block does not disappoint! in fact it will blow away all the joints out of the water. literally...sushi the way its suppose to be! made to order, light, refreshing and the sushi rice is perfect! not too much and not to little. but be patient.. the chefs are working overtime and the freshness is just as though the fish came out of the sea this morning! im not sure how they do it but coming from laoc, im serious when i say this place sets a new standard. service is excellent and friendly!! we will definitely come back!! p.s. kids 9 and under are 12 price. here are the kids reviews  chloe gave it a thousand stars and lukey gave it a million hundred thousand stars...chloe said if she was rich she would give them 1lb of gold for a tip! :
place is solid sushi is of a high quality for ayce. lunch price is 21.95 very reasonable. service is fast and courteous. go with the oh! jenna roll.
very clean and nice staff yummy sushi!! there is a sushi bar to sit at with a live chief ! and tables to accommodate groups!
excellent quality sushi for ayce. 20.95 lunch 1hr and 26.95 dinner 90 minmake sure to try the garlic edamame with your aycemake sure to try the sorbet for dessert after the ayce
amazing place. i came here for my late night bday dinner and loved it! great customer service, good environment, delicious rolls; tiger roll was sooo good. the waitress, kini, was very friendly and very attentive. she recommended the honey bread and its a must for dessert! boyfriend  i came from la and are sushi lovers, sushi way is one of the tops!
by far the best sushi i have ever had. ive always been skeptical to try a new sushi place because im scared i wont enjoy the food. this place had the freshest food i have ever had. ever order was delicious. the service was amazing. if there was 6 stars i would give 6 stars. definitely will come back and i might replace my favorite sushi spot
i just ate there tonight and the other positive reviews are on target.  i dont give out 5 star reviews often but this place deserves it.  this is not like other all you can eat sushi places where they give you lots of rice and small pieces of fish.  each dish is prepared with a noticeable attention to detail that is normally reserved for highend sushi bars.  i opted for chefs choice tonight and i was not dissaponted.  the chef brought me some very good sushi dishes that i would never have thought of ordering on my own.  some of the other reviews have complained about slow service.  i can see where some impatient people would say that but remember this is not a buffet and it is not fast food.  quality and attentions to detail does take a little longer.  so relax, enjoy the company you came with and enjoy some excellent sushi.  i will be back and i will be bringing firends.
first time eating here fish was so fresh and cold!!! not one thing i ordered wasnt the best i ever had!! the ownerchef was so nice and on top of everything will tell everyone about this spot
great place to be at, for sure one of the best sushi places i have ever been at and i go to a lot of sushi places. the sushi here is just top quality sushi, also the service here is definitely great service. highly recommend this place to go to! enjoy :
absolutely amazing place. we actually originally showed up to a neighboring japanese restaurant but left due to the odd smell and unfriendly guests and employees. we wandered into sushi way randomlly and man were we impressed. the fish quality was fantastic! thick slices of fish. great price with the all you can eat. me and my girlfriend must have sat there and ate for 6 people. the hostserver was very nice and our sushi bar man juno was so nice. gave us his full attention, recommending dishes, making them promptly. we had some great food and will be coming back next time were in town.
i will definitely come here again. the food was fresh and delicious,  the staff was friendly.
these guys are sushi rock stars!!! they might be the new kids on the block, but they have the freshest sushi in vegas. the owner and chef jun, has a passion for sushi and you can taste it in his creative dishes. i highly recommend sushi way... its the best way : you must try the poki salad yum!!!!
damn good sushi..... i expect huge lines in this little hidden gem.  recommend the orgamsic roll.... to die for!
yes i agree with the other yelpers... well worth it if you do the ayce, but we opted for the bento boxes, which were complete with the usual meat, sushi  tempura. service was great, maybe because we were the only few there on a friday night, wait, did i just say that? open til 2am, so we barely made it before the crowd started pouring in. still fairly new, so hopefully their quality stays the same once the word gets out p
i was anxious to try this place after reading the reviews. i was not disappointed!its nice to have a good ayce joint in the area.i came late at night. the service was stellar and the food was very good. the chef was eager to please when i told him that it was my first time and that i would try anything he recommended. hopefully this place is here for a long time!
definitely recommend this place fresh fish great dishes really clean and friendly staff ..... alaska roll is a must for me ..... please visit sushi way and enjoy their sushi
had an excellent 5 star experience this weekend at sushi way!  theyre a little behind the strip and definitely worth the commute to this hidden gem.  dont be scared when you hear this is all you can eat sushi.  its actually all made to order personally by the head sushi chefowner.  there are many great items to try all for 26.95 for dinner.  you have 90 minutes and you can pick whatever you want from the menu.  hot or cold items, also anything on the daily special board which was amazing. i enjoyed the salmon belly sushi, the white tuna and yellowtail sashimi.  from the main menu they have some fun rolls to try with their unique sauces like the i love my ass.service was top notch.  we were well taken care of, provided recommendations, and you will get very personalized service here.  really friendly and the environment, food, drinks were all great.  they stay open until 1am on sunday and 2am on other days.  i cant wait to come back and wish they were down here in the oc.  this is a great price for what youre going to get and the food is really good too.  im sure this place will be getting popular as you can already see all the rave reviews on yelp.
go out of your way, to give sushi way a shot. this centrally located sushi spot is housed in the same shopping center that firefly used to be in. i came for the ayce lunch special, which is 21.95, includes all rollssides; excludes sashimi. they have a decent little menu, and many options to choose from. there are a lot of baked and fried rolls here as well. now, typically i wouldnt go for these types of rolls, but right now i have a strict no raw fish rule in place because of health reasons. so, i was really craving sushi, and noticed sushi way had numerous options that would fit my needs.the sushi chefs are very nice, as are the servers. most of my sushi and sides arrived quickly, and i was asked if i wanted more sushi when i was almost complete with each of the rolls i had in front of me. i wont list off all the rolls i ate here, but i had 4, as well as two different sides. i was very pleased with the meal, and i would certainly return for another visit.
this is my first review and i promise i dont give out give stars easy.  this place though, this place!! by far the best ive had since moving back from japan.  only open for two months!? you would swear these guys have been at it for decades.  the sushi is spot on and fresh.  the menu is full of legit items.  the best part? all you can eat for 26!  i will always come here when ever im in town! my tip? get the all you can eat, sit at the bar, tell them to make whatever they want and watch the magic happen.  you will not be disappointed. i promise!
excelent and fresh fish, super nice service, not expensive at all. we forgot our credit card and they were super effective when giving it back. i loved the dinner all together a lot!
out in vegas for business and my boyfriend and i had only 1 thing in our agenda... ayce sushi! i did a quick yelp search of what was closest to our hotel and found this spot with 5 stars . to say the least, we were really blown away by the topnotch service, unique flavors and fresh selection at sushi way. the salmon tartar, poke and sashimi were all solid. in addition our waiter was so kind to offer all the best recommendation. some of the unique things we tried were the sexy lady topped with coconut and the carrot top  topped with fried carrots. i was really impressed to see some of these dishes that have never been done before.  this will likely be my new go to spot when i make the trip out again. hats off to the staff for a job well done!
we stay in the wynn and walk to here to have sushi, worth it! so delicious! the dinner buffet is 26.96. love ink, salmon! nice
good sushi! service was excellent! theres only 1 host and hes also the waiter...hes very efficient!  the place is clean and modern. you can make your own rollsyou can order half rollsdessert is only 1 per personopen late!we will back!
i just back from this ayce sushi resturant. the resturant was dark and seating was average in comparison to other sushi resturant. i did notice that there werent any seatings for 2. not a big deal but if you come with just one other person expect to have 2 empty seats next to you. kinda kills the romantic vibe. i came in during a slow time so im not sure how busy it gets but the store was basically empty for most of the time. there is also a bar where you can watch the chef crate the sushi right in front of you. what! pretty cool. we didnt sit there though we just sat at a table. there was only one waiter while we were there but another showed up as we left. the waiter that helped us was very attentive without being intrusive. it was a little hard to understand him but that wasnt a big deal. he was very nice.the food. only have one word for it... amazing. the 5 stars probably killed the suspense of that but whatever. we had a lot of sushi rolls. probably around 10. needless to say we were pretty stuffed after we left. they were all good. some better than others. the only one that i didnt particularly enjoy was the fat ass. they dont call it that for no reason. it was huge! however it did taste a little bland compared to the other rolls. it was still good though... i dont eat spicy food. like at all and i was disappointed to see most of the menu items had some sort of spicy ingredient. i was a little turned off when i saw that the sushi i ordered had jalapenos... until i tasted it. freaking amazing! the spiciness wasnt overwhelming at all. it added a small zesty taste to the sushi. coming from a person that hates spicy food. it was the best thing i have ever tasted with jalapenos on it. they do offer a fairly small desert menu. i got the green tea ice cream. it was good as expected. they offer one desert per person if you get the ayce deal.they do have a few rules that actually didnt bother us at all. a common rule in most ayce sushi resturant is that if you dont finish the roll then you have to pay full price for it. this is the norm so it didnt really bother us. also we saw that there was an hour time limit to eat on the menu. however it was slow and they didnt really hold us to that. i imagine during more busy time of day they might be more strict on this rule.decor average and no two table seatings 4 stars     add seatings for 2 and this will immediately jump to a five. they probably wont though because the resturant was a little small.service attentive without being intrusive 5 starsfood amazing 5 starsif you havent been here. definitely check it out. they gave us a coupon for free meal on our 11th visit. we will definitely be back and are looking forward to our future free meal and many more to come!
i was impressed with the quality and the cut of the fish.  from a sashimi standpoint a little thin. but i was impressed with the lack of rice in their rolls!!  most places you run into throw so much rice into their rolls you never get enough fish!   not the case here!flavored were spot on.  my favorite roll of the night was the i like my ass!!  yes indeed, soft shell crab that had great flavor a!one of my tests for a new sushi joint is to see if they have fresh wasabi.  this is key in great sushi joint!  ever since i was introduced to it by a very close friend and sushi chef it is the tell tale of a place in my book.the attentiveness of the staff was bar none phenomenal!!  the all you can eat menu isnt limited on what you can get but rather how much you can devour in 60 minutes during lunch or 90 minutes during dinner!!! highly recommend you check out this new one!!  i think they will be around for awhile once the word is out!!thanks again for a pleasant eating experience on the road!!
you cant go wrong with the sashimi or nigiri items  delicious  tender  melts in your mouth
ive been to 100s of sushi places and sushi way is among the best. clean, friendly and a terrific value.
as an obsessed sushieater, i had to try this new place in town and boy was i not disappointed! the fish is fresh, topquality, and delicious! the appetizers were good and what i love the most about this place is that they offer great variety of delicious rolls, ordered as a full roll or half roll! my fave place in town do not allow us to order half rolls so i never got to try a variety of rolls and usually stick with the nigiri but now i can! besides the food, the service was good and the place is clean which is pretty important in my book!. this place has definitely become one of my top ayce sushi restaurants. i will definitely frequent this place more, despite living in the other side of town!
the food was amazing ! it took a little long to come out. but it was worth the wait. the california dream roll was definitely my favorite especially if you add cream cheese , yummy ! i love the selection and the prices arent bad at all for how delicious the sushi is ! i suggest this to everyone !
hands down.the freshest.best sushi i have ever had. the owner takes.great.pride in his work and it shows!!!!!¡!!!!¡!
i am reluctant to write this review knowing it will only raise their profile and more people will discover this restaurant... but it was that good, people deserve to know. the sushi and all you can eat menu were just amazing. the server we had was great, helped with recommendations and was very accommodating. the sushi chefs were the fastest ive seen and their presentation was great. the selection was exactly what i was looking for in an all you can eat too. this will be on my todo list every time i visit! wish id discover this sooner.
this place. theres not much that i can say about sushi way other than stellar!the staff is attentive, the chefs personable, the environment soothing...dont get me started on the food.alright...im a sushi fiend. and sushi way does not disappoint in the slightest. their fish is fresh, their rice is the perfect texture. there is a balance between the fish and the rice, unlike many ayce places that pile on the rice while minimizing cost by skimping on the fish portions. ill eat just about anything, so i love to ask the chefs what they like or to surprise me. to not be too terrible longwinded, ill just say that you better get to this place asap! theyre new, so they arent always packed, but when the word gets out and around...trust me. sushi way will be slammed 247 well, when theyre open. love it! gotta have it! this is the only way to enjoy your sushi around the strip and in the vegas metro area.
love love love this place.in from dallas, and found this place via yelp. our waitress grace lived up to her name with the remarkable service. she recommended two rolls to start. the oh jenna and the sexy lazy. they launched the all you can eat on it perfected way.i am indeed a sushi freshness snob, and every bite we had was wonderful. for 26 each, sushi way cant be beat. we mainly saw locals here which was a good sign.we were staying at the rio and although only 3 miles away, it was a 15 and 20min ride in early evening traffic. but well worth it.
awesome sushi, specially my other half very picky when it comes to sushi. i love the server very quick  friendly. first time that we barely use the soy sauce because the flavor is so good
yumm alert!you like all you can eat sushi? can you stuff it in your pie hole sushi hole in an hour? you betcha!for about 26 bucks for dinner, one person, no sharing, finish in an hour anything on the menu. challenge accepted!my dining guest does not eat sushi.... sadly... however, he did have some amazing pot stickers as well as some tasty katsu chicken; so there is something on the menu for our non sushi eating friends.here is a tip as well....... you can order half sizes of the rolls! if you are anything like me you want to try as much as your sushi tummy can handle! also, beer drinking is fun, but it does have a tendency to make that rice expand in your belly, so stick to water or their amazing tea... lunch is around 21 smackers, all you can eat, no sharing... you get the idea...oh yes i will be back!
food was really good. specially the spicy rice! and the all you can eat dinner buffet was more than worth it. servers were great and very attentive to ensuring we were taken care of. two thumbs up!
excellent service, great quality food! the staff was friendly and the chefs prepare the food rather quickly but to quality standards. sizeable menu which includes sashimi with the all you can eat, so they are not trying to fill you up with rice. make sure you try the honey bread for dessert. definitely recommending to local friends and anyone visiting that wants great quality sushi at a great price!
this is hands down the best sushi restaurant ive been to thus far. were talking better than yama, kaizen, sushi mon and jjanga. they are fairly new in town so i can only hope this continues to be the case after theyve become more popular. the friendly, warm service was better than expected. this one guy richard, who seemed to be the manager, constantly came over to check on me and other guests. based on my initial orders, he asked if he could recommend a couple dishes which were the specials of the evening. ive never had this happen before during an ayce experience.there is soft lighting, dark tables and chairs and music that wasnt loud enough to get annoying. this would make a good place for a date. the sushi bar was the most spacious ive seen to date and with plenty of elbow room between chairs.my picks for the evening:screaming orgasm: lightly seared tuna over a bed of radish with some o sauce.salmon tar tarepoke saladevening specials sashimi: super white tuna  yellowtail. both with jalapenos. rolls: big easy, dancing eel, kiss of fire, burning your stomach after demolishing said dishes, i polished off the meal with a refreshing order of their yuzu sorbet. part of me wanted the honey bread but nobody needed to see me get assisted out the door. for 26 buckaroos for dinner, it cant get better than this. also, dont forget your stamp card. your 11th ayce is on them. i will be back at least once before the end of this month.
fantastic place! the fish is first rate. particularly enjoyed the amebi, hamachi, and the albacore. nigiri is nicely made with just the right amount of rice, ie, not too much. the ability to order half rolls is perfect for being able to try different combinations without filling up too quickly. will definitely return here on my next trip to lv!
great food and very friendly service. very little rice in the rolls which is rare for such an extensive ayce menu. we have found our new favorite sushi spot in vegas!
excellent. excellent. excellent. quality sushi. clean, simple, and attentive service. great music.
i could make this a long review because there is a lot to say... but its simple, best quality sushi and most creative rolls ive ever had for ayce. if it wasnt ayce and i had paid full price it would have still been worth it... and this is from someone whos tried, nobu, katsuya, izakaya. great service at bar, try it!
best ayce! i have looked low and high for a great sushi restaurant and i think i have finally found it! went in on a sunday night, there was no wait and the service was fast. the manager i think is also from hawaii so he was a delight to talk to. everything was super fresh and tasty. i will definitely be back!
great selection. exceptional service. near the strip. one of the best ayce sushi spots in vegas.
awesome place! gave it a try and truly not disappointed! if you are unsure of where you should go... try this new place! derive ok.
best urchin i have had in a very very long time. they keep the urchin very fresh well protected as its only one order per person, you will be hooked, so be prepared. my date rule is if a sushi bar has urchin and place an order if your date likes it or at least tries it, heshe is a keeper in my rulebook...service was execellent, sat  the bar, little less conversation and more action from the sushi chefs, elvis was there...
all you can eat sushi at a reasonable price! all the staff were extremely nice and they all seemed to help each other. our waitress warned us that there was a bit of a wait for the sushi so she gave us some suggestions for side orders while we were waiting. the coconut shrimp tempura and the spicy garlic edamame were delicious!  our favorite rolls were the rainbow roll and the rock n roll. the green monster was also really great! the cherry blossom wasnt a roll but a ball that came but it was also excellent!  all the food on the menu are a part of the all you can eat sushi including the sides. the only thing that was not included in the all you can eat deal was the soda but that was okay with us!  if you get a chance, try the strawberry mochi ice cream. the mango mochi was good too but we liked the strawberry just a little bit better. make sure to use google maps instead of apple maps if you have an iphone. the apple maps too us to the wrong shopping center it said it was in the same shopping center as the chipotle and panera bread, it is not at that shopping center. it is in the same shopping center as the citi bank and the beer and tacos place. its at the intersection of paradise and corporate drive. just a heads up, we walked there but i do not advise walking from the strip if you are not with a 63 body builder. the walk is easy but the roads around it had some vacant lots and if youre just a tourist like we are, it may be best to grab a cab to the place. highly recommend.
after comparing other ayce sushi places to dohs, this is my new favorite place.  came here for lunch at about 12:15 on a wednesday.  only one sushi chef and several tables were occupied, so the wait for  your order was a few minutes.  once the 2nd sushi chef arrived, everything went a lot faster.  our waitress was very attentive and courteous.nigiri sushi tasted very fresh.  cuts of fish were pretty big, while the rice was kept to a minimum.  we had a desert called honey bread, using hawaiian sweet bread dinner rolls.  shokudo in hawaii uses something like texas toast.  similar in taste, just not quite as big.usually i walk out of an ayce sushi place feeling full and uncomfortable.  this time i felt satisfied and just right.  very comfortable atmosphere.definitely will be back for my sushi cravings!
really nice servicers and beautiful decor. the sushi was delicious! the price was good for ayce and the sushi was worth it. their dessert option for yuzu sobert was a delight because i never seen it before and it was awesome. i will admit that it took a while to receive our food but it was worth it. definitely will be coming back. cant wait to bring people to try their sushi.
excellent! followed recommendations from yelp and this place was fantastic! our waiter was great and very personable! ive been to quite a few ayce sushi places that take forever to get you your rolls. not here high quality and fast!
jun the owner has developed some unique rolls. ive been here 3 times now and it is a must for me every time im in vegas. the all you can eat is a fantastic deal!
the selection is huge and reasonably priced for sure. i was surprised that the sushi was so fresh and very tasty.  ambience is plain but clean. the server that helped us was super fun and helpful. definitely great tip for them and will be back.
this place is great!food: no complaints, we didnt order the all you can eat, we did all sushi and rolls and everything was great. the super white tuna with jalapenos was amazing, as was the dancing eel roll.ambience: this is your standard sushi restaurant. service: ask for richard, he is an amazing waiter, make sure you ask for the korean saki!tip: order the honey bread for desert you will not be disappointed.
in las vegas on a business trip and wanted good sushi at a fair price. after my coworkers and i talked about it, we decided to try sushi way. in a nutshell, we werent dissapointed. the sushi was made to order and the selection was broad. if you had something you wanted that wasnt on the menu, they will make it for you. also included was a nice selection of hot items like tempura. all you can eat for 27 or the price of 2 rolls. enjoy!
so utterly amazing and service was out of this world!
did the ayce. being that i live in a nonsushi kind of place, sushi is the one thing i have to have when i go to vegas. because i want to get more than one piece, i like to go off strip for my fix. this was a new choice, and i was not disappointed. the boyfriend and i did the all you can eat, getting the nigiri first: super tuna, scallops, salmon, and yellowtail. all were fresh, with nice, properly seasoned rice and reasonable portions, with the scallop being the stand out i think i had six pieces total. for the rolls, they allow you to get half and half if youre torn between two choices, as i was with the alaska and arizona rolls, and again, great sizes, super fresh, and tasty combos i preferred the alaska with the crab, but thats just personal taste. also got the salmon tartar, which is quite rich, served as a round with a top layer of salmon tartar, a lower layer of mayocrab, and a creamy mayo sauce. the shrimp tempura was light and not greasy. the only disappointment was the tempura ice cream, with a heavy, unappealing shell over the green tea ice cream. but it was such a minor fault and i really wasnt there for dessert that i dont care. the sushi chef was super friendly and very on the ball, he almost seemed disappointed when we stopped ordering even though i thought wed been kind of piggish. overall, a very satisfying experience.
this is the best sushi place ever!!! the price ayce  great quality  amazing!!!
ayce is the best here. fish is super fresh. service is amazing. normally with all you can eat, you are limited to very few rice filled basic rolls, not here, you get to choose basically anything you want. the rolls are made with attention to detail with extremely fresh fish. will be back for sure.
great ayce sushi! be sure to have jay as your server, his suggestions were spot on.  the menu had so many great items and rolls, so go with a group so you can try different ones, but be sure to get the screaming orgasm app. youll wish you could get multiples.
the owner is very friendly even after it being our second time he recognized us and thanked us for coming back. we went once and loved it the second time was just as wonderful. its great to see someone so passionate about his place. he also make great sushi :
everywhere i travel,  i find a sushi joint. i chose this one for the number of positive reviews compared to other places. and i always take any negative ones with a grain of salti am glad i came here, it couldnt have been much better. the sushi was very fresh and the chef has some unique twists i never had before like searing several rolls right in front of you. the owner was our chef. he was super friendly and fun. whenever i come back to vegas, this will be a mandatory stop every time!!
really good sushi  very polite outstanding customer service definitely recommend it all you can eat
i am not one to go to an ayce sushi restaurant but did based on the reviews. i was not disappointed! service, presentation,  freshness, taste, all great. i cant explain any negative comments from other reviews. they had a generous selection and all was made to order. one limitation was you had 90 minutes to eat but i dont see that being an issue for anyone. next time i am in town ill be back.
this was my second time at sushi way for the ayce lunch 60 minute limit and it didnt disappoint. not sure what the deal with the time limits are as long as you are not sitting there for a really long time.  didnt see any egg timers clicking the minutes away. the service was quick and friendly with 3 members of the staff from the chef owner to servers providing a nice experience. standouts for me included the super white tuna nigiri and the carrot top roll. mmm. if you want a really tasty and fun experience, then check out sushi way.  from the rolls, nigiri, seaweed and poke salad, ive always found their ingredients to be top notch. there are so many tasty bites of things, it can be hard to decide.  tried the kamikaze dynamite and it was super tasty; a piping hot little ramekin filled with button mushrooms, garlic, and onions. yummy!i think its terrific that they are open late night and are located near the strip.  just be sure to note that they dont serve lunch on sundays.also, ive not been to dinner, but am sure its even a bit better as it includes uni and screaming o and includes a 90 minute time limit.
take it from a guy that has been over 50 times to sushi mon according to checkins  this is the best ayce sushi place in town right now.  jun has opened a great place with remarkable service and great tasting food.  some people have complained about the wait time, he has hired more peeps and the wait time has been cut down considerably.  for the value and the great taste and cuts of fish, you cant beat sushi way.  the hamachi kama is huge and full of meat.  poke is great.  hand rolls are wonderful and the negiri sushi is like any other nice sushi place you would go.  his play on tempura shrimp coconut tempura shrimp is great also.  for the value and the great food, i highly recommend sushi way.  dont forget the honey bread dessert!
the sushi was super fresh  and the uni was tasty. i always get it without the seaweed just uni on rice. garlic yellowtail sushi was my second favorite and the sweet shrimp my third. yummy
went to sushi way last night for the first last night and am so glad i did.  everything was fresh and tasty, the menu was overwelming even to a veteren ayce sushi diner.  so many rolls sounded so good i wish i could have tried more, but i did manage to try the big easy, sweet 16, spider roll, hamichi, salmon belly and super white tuna with jalapenochef special that day.  the list of appetizers was extensive as well.  the bacon wrapped scallops and kamakazi dynamite were recommended by our chefowner, who was very friendly and was ready and willing to keep our sushi flowing.  i live in reno and only get down to vegas 4 to 5 times a year,  i cant wait to come back and try some more menu items.  i highly recommend having dinner here so good!
this place is amazing! my girlfriend and i made a last minute trip to vegas and were looking for a good sushi joint. this place easily goes toe to toe with sushi samba. we sat at the bar and got excellent service from ivan  the 22yr old sushi chef wonder. i cant wait to come back to this joint next time im in vegas!
this place is so good! fast service! the all you can eat is such a great deal. there are so many rolls to choose from. so glad we came here on our visit to vegas. definitely recommend coming here if your in the mood for sushi.
after trying this place for the first time a couple of months back, i refused to eat sushi anywhere else in las vegas !!! june is thee best!!
the sushi was prepared very quickly without sacrificing any quality.  i had an hour lunch break at conference.  easily made it back to conference in time.  i didnt do all you can eat, but guy beside us at sushi bar was.  it looked to be like a great deal if that kind of thing is for you.
the food was above my expectations for all you can eat. the staff was also very kind asking what i wanted next. i am writing this review because they treated me wonderful for being a late night random visit.
hands down the best sushi i have ever had with a lot of great options to choose from, and the customer service to match it... but you will pay for it
simply amazing! if you love sushi come here they treat you great and have amazing food hands down favorite place ive been to.
the best ayce in town. i am a huge fan about ayce, i tried a lot but this one is completely different . it s more like a fine sushi place , the quality is definitely here. i tried so many dish , i will not able to do the list but a few are very remarquable : the cherry blossom is a peace of art and the sexy lazy special is very tasty and orignal  if you like coconut.the service is very fast , that is not always common in a usual acye sushi.
recently took a party of five here and had a great experience. the ayce menu was stocked full of essentials and the quality of fish was good. a hidden gem for anyone that enjoys simple ayce sushi. they also have great chief specials and recommend honey bread for dessert.
very delicious!!!  highly recommended. fresh fish. will definitely come back again :
its off the strip a little way, but you will not be disappointed! good food and way cheaper than the big hotels. we used lyft to get there and back to the strip.
my husband and i were looking for a great sushi place for dinner and happened to find this place... it did not disappoint!!! richard was awesome and so were his recommendations!!! u have to try the salmon tartare appetizer and the honey toast dessert... as for rolls, they were all really good!!!
best salmon in las vegas!!!! so fresh, cut perfectly every time,  chilled so it melts in your mouth. i could eat this all day. awesome service.
we took our family to this restaurant and it was delicious. we had a lot of fun and the service was really good. the allyoucaneat sushi was fantastic.
from out of town but this place was amazing and the staff was very friendly too!! cant wait till i am back in vegas to come back here!
fantastic place. first time here. my family and i will be back here without a doubt.  sushi chef was friendly, fast, and funny. all you can eat is the way to go options are beyond any other all you can eat sushi menu.  for some reason our daughters teriyaki chicken took a while to come out, but dont let that stop you from trying this place.
came here on saturday on my very last night in vegas. my girlfriend and i enjoyed the food they provided for us. our food did take awhile to get to us but we were compensated with a bottle of sake and halibut. would definitely come back here again.
chef chu chu was amazing , richard was a great server. i and my boy had a great time there with all you can eat menu. sushi was great and fish was so fresh. sweet shrimp was amazing. excellent service from richard and chef chu chu will bring us back there again.
the sushi here is amazing.  they have fresh fish and great service. i mean you can get good sushi anywhere, but i think its the friendly staff that makes this place great.   the portions are perfect and the presentation is great. their ayce price is pretty much the same as everywhere else. their quality is great. its not a huge place but its nice and can accommodate big groups. i personally love the sushi bar. i like being one on one with the chefs.    our server was on point and so was ivan, our sushi chef. he was easy to talk to and very personable.  he made us some amazing rolls. he asked us what we liked and made us some off the menu rolls that were incredible.  everything tasted great, i highly recommended you stop by andgive it a try.the super white tuna was my favorite. it just melts in your mouth not in your hands.
this was the most amazing all you can eat sushi place you can eat at for the price. the sushi was freshly made to order.
ordered on grub hub for the first time, they said itd be about an hour and fifteen minute wait, only waited about 30 minutes. quick delivery and sushi was fresh and delicious. i recommend this place and look forward to future orders.
theres a new kid in town for all you can eat sushi. theres a lot of these in vegas and the quality is all over the place. this one is on point. almost everything on the menu is included in the deal. cool presentation in the little serving plates as well.  our server richard was very pleasant and helpful. highly recommended.
excellent selection! so happy we chose this place for dinner. we ordered sweet 16 roll, eel roll, volcano roll, sushi pizza, many other sushimi specials which were amazing. dont forget to order dessert at the end too. the green tea ice cream was very tasty. definitely got our moneys worth. not far from the strip and easy parking.
wish i found this place sooner than later. great staff and service. lets not forget about the food. there was a party in my tummy and it was a good party!!
stopped in on the way to the airport for a quick bite and it was great.  wonderful service thank you
come by and see the owner june for an amazingly delectable experience. we stopped in for the all you can eat sushi for lunch and told him to surprise us! it was delicious and had some great conversations. highly recommend fresh fish and great atmosphere.
all you can eat at a great price. sat at the bar and had fantastic service, chefs were very fun and attentive. the sushi i had was better than many places with much higher prices highly recommend!
this place was fantastic! fulfilled my sushi appetite with rolls, sushi ngiri, oyster shooters, white fish with jalapeno and then some! we were greeted and sat by this beautiful and set girl who explained their all you can eat dinner for 26.95 and that pretty much everything on the menu was included.  we started out with rolls sushi solution, chicago fire, rainbow roll and i love sushi...all delicious!  we topped it off with sides of golbi, white fish with jalapenos, salmon ngiri..before we could think of something else to get,  our server jay just started bringing out extras for us to try including coconut shrimp, oyster shooters interesting and not as horrible as i expected, although i didnt chew husband did and he thought it was great. albeit, there were no the guests,  but being that they are open till 2am, we went during the old peoples hour and the place gets hopping later on in the night.  haha. ..either way,  definitely coming back during this visit!
highest quality fish  seafood out of any vegas ayce sushi joints ive been to, including yama, sakana, twister, goyemon, and kaya. super fast service. the salmon tare tare is delicious. sushi nacho is killer. all nigiri is of the highest qualityfreshness. large selection of flavored japanese sake and beer. order the sake cooler. also has great lunch specials if you are on the go. new favorite sushi place.free wifi. dont forget to ask for a stamp card!!
another fantastic experience at this fine sushi establishment. this time i had more of the nigiri selections and they were fantastic. my favorites were the garlic tuna and seared salmon. truly melt in your mouth delicious.other winners were the kamikaze dynamite, jalapeno poppers, wakame, and poke salad. i could easily eat this every day. plus, the ayce lunch is 21.95, a terrific value. cant wait for my next yummy visit. until then sushi way.
very accommodating that we were in a hurry. food came out super fast and it was all very fresh and delicious! highly recommended.
this place is amazing fish quality is amazing very fresh....im a sushi chef as well and will continue to come and eat here chef ivan is a great experienced man made me some awesome items very friendly shared a beer with him the only thing is i wish could have tipped more everyone is very friendly but christmas wiped me out
our family was extremely excited to try this restaurant, as were very enthusiastic about sushi and the like. sushi way, at first, was a little disappointing, with the wait time going a little long. however, when the food started coming, we were blown out of the water. the sushi is great, the service is great, and the atmosphere is welcoming. plus, we had a few laughs with our server and got compensated for the wait time with mussels and gyoza. all in all, a very recommended place, and wed definitely love to come here again.
since i am new to the area i have been shopping around for a nail salon and icolor nail bar is it! the employees were attentive, not rushed and my nails look great even after a week. i also enjoyed the atmosphere as it was not your ordinary nail salon decor, but more edgy and fun. strongly recommend and cannot wait to go back for another manipedi.
my bff recommended this nail bar. im from md so i was kind of skeptical since i was not familiar with good nail places.  let me just say..the nail bar far exceeded my expectations its really setup like a bar with hige massage chairs. i like the fact that all of the pedicure bowls have plastic around it and is changed with each pedi. can we say...being sanitary is key so i loved that idea. i got the opi signature pedi which included paraffin treatment, massage etc....ohhhemmmmmmgeeee amazeballs and my nail tech katie was awesome. her massages were incredible and i wanted to take the massage chair home. i will definitelybe back whrn i come in town. did i mention they serve wine. the sangria was very good!!!
the best sandwich i ever had was at this store about a week ago. ive been to many different subway stores, and while some are better than others, none have been able to get it 100 right until i got a subway club 12 from here.the employee briana made it just perfect on the toppings and the toast settings. maybe its just me, but the bread seemed a lot more fresh than from the other subways ive stopped in to.everything about this place was quality, and it seems to be one of the cleaner stores, too. glad i stopped in here the day i did. i seldom tip fast food, but i decided to this time. it was totally worth it. visited on 81315 i think
so we have all been to our share of subways,some bad some good. but this place really sets the standards very high. i am very big on cleanliness and this place is top notch. the staff were all very friendly even at the end of the night. the bread is very different than that of others very fresh and fluffy. love it. i will be returning here time after time and telling all my friends about this subway.
i consistently have a superior experience in this store. friendliness, cleanliness, and quality are above most other subways. i have been in about a million subways in my travels, and im lucky that this one is in my neighborhood.
found it, like most people, after coming out of galaxy theaters. my friends and i stopped inside and the staff was so lovely and willing to talk about the product and there were plenty of samples to try.ive been back like 3 times for a chocolate cronut. it is absolutely phenomenal and i love it. and its nice that someone there remembers me from the piercings that i have on my arm!sadly i went today, at 7 pm on sunday and its closed but it says its supposed to be open until 9?  definitely still deserving of a five star review of course! i was just a little let down i dont get that delicious cronut.
holy cow... so delish! we stopped while leaving the galaxy and were so excited to find this new sweet spot. we sampled the black cherry ricotta cheesecake and purchased one of those as well as a chocolate lava cake comes with ice creamyum! and a chocolate snickers cronut to go. we havent tried the cronut yet, but the other two desserts were awesome. well be back for sure!! super cute place, free samples, and friendly service. check out chocolate moose to satisfy your next sugar craving!
this place is wonderful, i live clear on the other side of town but try to get in there at least a couple times a month. all of the cupcakes are tasty, along with the cheesecakes. i love the sandwiches as well. their service is great and the decor is beautiful. i highly recommended this place if youre looking for a sweet treat or lunch in general.
the location is great due to being next to the galaxy movie theater and being able to get something to eat before andor after a movie...the food is awesome and decently priced for being made fresh to order...make sure you also try the sample of desserts they offer as i have been there several times have never been disappointed with the food, dessert and level of customer service ive received
very clean eatery. unspeakably amazing desserts. the cupcakes are a masterpiece. the mousse is good enough to be placed in a michelin starred restaurant. we also had a turkey pesto sandwich, equally amazing. all in all, this place should be included in your go to places to amazing your family and friends.
my husband and i had some time to kill before our movie and stopped in.  the staff was friendly, the shop was clean, and the environment was cozy,calm, and inviting.  the chocolate moose and the cheesecake were incredible.  i cant wait to go back and try their other desserts.
stopped in with my daughters to get something for a special dessert.  we took home one of each cupcake to make a 12 dozen.  it was like cupcake wars came to life in my kitchen.   the flavors were unique and fun and bold and delicious.  the cake is moist and the icing, so pretty and flavorful.  cant wait to try more.
great cupcakes and free samples! we got the chocolate mousse, chocolate chip cookies. service was courteous and genuine.
stumbled upon this little gem and had the moose! oh my goodness the combination of cake, moose and rum flavored chocolate frosting is perfect. i will for sure be back.
omgoooodness the most amazing sweets and shakes and snacks in town! hubby had their signature chocolate mousse cheesecake and a salted caramel shake, i had a cinnamon and brown sugar shake... phenomenal! and the owners are just as sweet as the treats they sell!
walking into this place takes you out of the city and into the feeling of a small cabin in the woods. the staff and environment is clean, friendly and it is relaxing to just hang out. the paninis are on point and the side pasta salad that comes with them is super. best part are the cupcakes. taste homemade and not all beefed up with too much sugar! returning customer who loves this place!!
this place is awesome! the staff are always friendly and welcoming. the cupcakes are to die for! it is the perfect after the movie treat.
awesome place with great desserts! they have sandwiches and other hot food but didnt get a chance to try them. if they are as good as the desserts, then i know i wont be disappointed!
came here with my boyfriend while we waited for our movie to start. i was so hungry and we both always have a sweet tooth. i ended up getting the aloha sandwich. it has ham and cheese and a homemade pineapple spread. so. good!!!! and we both got two shakes. i got mine with a cupcake in it! i really like this place!! the mom and daughter are so nice! we got samples of the moose and different ice cream flavors too! im a fan! :
very impressive!this place goes the extra mile.  i am very happy with  my  meal.   very underated.  very  glad i stopped in.
i have eaten here regularly since they opened. the range of selections on the menu is great, and everything i have tried has been excellent. the staff is very friendly as well. dont hesitate to give it a try.
i saw construction for this building for a while and have been waiting for it to finally open. my boyfriend and i were trying to decide what we wanted to lunch and drove by and saw people in the restaurant. we both looked at each other and were immediately excited! once we entered the restaurant we were greeted by friendly faces and beautiful colorful decor! the environment is very open and inviting. since it was a saturday, all of the lunch menu items are 6 and they come with a salad. typically the lunch items average about 9 so it was nice to have that mini deal. the food came out promptly and perfect temperature. my boyfriends son is very cautious with hot food but we didnt have to worry about it with his kid dish. i ordered the yuxiang pork and my boyfriend had the lemon pepper chicken. both were under the spicy categories but we didnt really find them spicy. they were definitely flavorful though! all in all, we were very happy with our meal and cannot wait to go back! we think this may be our new saturday spot since the special they have on saturdays are deal breakers!
since this location is brand new, it wasnt yet on yelp. i requested for an additional menu to gather information and add the business onto yelp. i informed our server it was strictly for yelp adding purposes and that i wasnt going to order anything else. he informed the manager and they sent us a free dessert for helping aid their start to social media. great management team!! thanks flos!
ask for corey behind the bar and get some great food and happy hour 37 all day everyday. classy new spot but still have pbr on draft.
i love flos! im so happy this restaurant has finally made its way to tempe... so delicious.  and a really really..... really good happy hour menu.  half off all drinks and great appetizer specials.the food is just as amazing as the other locations.  my favorite is the mongolian beef, but the bartender introduced me to the salt and pepper wings which might be my new obsession.  this place is brand new so expect some slight hiccups, but he final product is always is delicious!!! i  heart flos!!!
this is hands down the best asian restaurant in the valley. happy hour is from 47, seven days a week, with half price appetizers and drinks. everything ive eaten here has been fantastic. the spicy shrimp and pork wontons and house roast pork are to die for. im coming in next week for the peking duck.
holy geesh this place is amazing. so many gluten free options! healthy too! so good. coming back for sure. happy to have this place in the neighborhood.
tried the yellow curry. very tasty with lots of fresh veggies green beans, broccoli, carrots, onions. the service was attentive and the lunch portion was just right. the decor is attractive and service was attentive. highly recommended.
this place is a must!! excellent happy hour prices, great portions, and nice place. the chicken lettuce cupswraps were 3.50 on happy hour and it was delicious!!  happy hour is everyday from 37 pm.
good food!  good service!   great choices!  what else could you want.   flos got it.  wonderful addition to the great city of tempe.   try it.
love, love this place for good asian food. the atmosphere is a good place for a first date or nice evening out with your sweetie or girls day with your bffs.
this location just opened in june and i finally stopped in last night with friends to check it out.  so glad we did!  there were six of us so i had the opportunity to try a bit of everything!  such a great menu and i couldnt find a dish on our table that wasnt awesome!  a bit pricey, but well worth it!
i had the thai style catfish and it was so delicious. it has a sauce that resembles curry although its not exactly like it. the fried rice its absolutely delicious... i will definitely be coming back for more! lindsay is excellent! kevin, the store manager made sure our meals were timely and our experience a great one! thanks!!
this was the best chinese food i have eaten in years!  the mooshoo chicken was excellent!  apps were great also. our sever was very accommodating to have noddles instead of rice on the kids meal.overall 5 stars!
my boyfriend and i just stumbled upon this place tonight and we enjoyed it so much i felt compelled to review.  the food was delicious, fresh, and filling! the staff was great, along with the atmosphere.  definitely would go back again! also, for vegans, or gluten free, etc. it is easily specified what it contains as far as allergies on the menu. no matter what your needs, flos has many options for all which makes choosing a great dish for everyone fun and easy just wonderful :
my fiancee and i came here as a celebration, got chocolate wantons as a gift. amazing atmosphere! beautiful menus and easy  to read. the staff so so friendly! stephanie was amazing and very personable. we will be here again soon.
this is our new favorite place to eat!  the lemon chicken is the best!  we have excellent service every time we go there.  the price is the lowest we paid in years.  we now are regulars and eat at flos at least twice a week!  thank you to the staff and kevin who manages a great place!
i just ate at flos and the service was amazing! the food was delicious and the ambiance was really nice.
the only thing i would change in this restaurant would be adding booths . i think it would add a more warm and comfortable feeling . the service was great for lunch . we absolutely loved the egg drop soup ! my husband love the fried rice and he keeps talking about going back for it lol!i really liked how clean the bathrooms were. the bar was very nicely set up .i can not wait to try more food !
ive been here on multiple occasions and the service has been great. our waiter was friendly. we were offered water which was nice. the food is good and flavorful. the skewers are my favorite along with the lettuce wraps. if you are looking for something that is tasty and easy flos is the way to go.
this place is awesome! i had the red chicken curry. the flavors were amazing! never had curry that good. everything seemed really fresh and cooked perfectly. there are plenty great dishes that you can chose from and the service was great. ill defiantly be going back soon!
i always start off with the words yelp brought me here followed by what ive read and i always find i get great service and in this case the server added a complimentary desert. either way this place has awesome food, a full bar and a very friendly staff. oh and get this... they have happy hour everyday between 37 yes you heard it here first including weekends which would make it happier hour. i had a local ipa from the good people at san tan brewery in chandler called the hop scotch ipa and i always order the pad thai dish when trying a new place and it did not disappoint. if youre in the area stop in trust me!
i enjoyed this meal. having ordered the beef  wide noodles, i was glad to see the healthysized bowl presented to me. they bury the noodles way down there, but there are plenty. the food is heavilyoiled, but not overly salted. fun and entertaining music played at this location. bright atmosphere; lovin the windows and the decor. stylish, clean, with small tables and lots of dining space.
this place is phenomenal!! it was our first time going there and we were extremely impressed. the environment was classy and our server, lindsey, was fantastic! the service was great and the food was to die for. we got the mongolian beef and orange chicken, the first bite astounded us. we will definitely be going back regularly. they have a great happy hour as well
my first time to flos, i needed take out, i craved curry, but saw the asian peanut chicken on the menu and knew i had to have it.  i called in,  first thing,  the guy taking my order didnt rush me.   second,  their chicken isnt breaded,  yeah!  third, i wanted extra veggies and he was kind enough to read me off the selections.   i got exactly what i wanted,  on time.  i ended up splitting it with my two kids. they were way more interested in my dinner then pizza.  i split the rice and dinner between 3 of us and we are stuffed.   the veggies were perfectly done,  still crisp, the sauce was full of flavor and the chicken was the right size and tender!   i will definitely be trying other amazing things!
ok...so who goes to happy hour at a chinese restaurant? this guy does now!!! wow! great food...great specials and our server stephanie was prompt...witty...and provided great service! will you see me again....uh yes!!!!! flos does happy hour right. only problem....i ordered so many apps i didnt try the entrees! next time i will pace myself...as if! lol....a must try!
im picky when is comes to asian food. i used to work at a japanese restaurant owned by a japanese chef and i can never find anything that compares until now.  i was here lunch and had the summer spring rolls and chicken katsu.  both were excellent.  the rice they serve with it is delicious.  ill be back soon to try other dishes for sure. mitchell took care me and the service was perfect.  highly recommend flos.
delicious food at a modest price.i got the orange chicken and asked them to spice it up. they brought it out really quick, almost frighteningly quick. with it came a side of rice.i went there on a date and really enjoyed the experience. my only concern was that the walls were plain, but thats just a little hurdle to get past.thumbs up!
love this place. the best happy hour ever. half price appetizers, half price drinks, and the food is amazing. this is our new favorite local hang out place in south tempe.
found myself in this store today. clean store, friendly staff, and good deals. im very happy with my purchase and the price : i will be back!
great prices and customer service. cant find these deals anywhere else. they are great about explaining the information about each tv and are helpful with any questions you may have. macbook prices are best ive seen as well
went in, grabbed a charger, got a discount because yelp, and got out. super nice and friendly guys. prices arent bad either.
awesome store! i walked in and was immediately greeted by their friendly staff and asked if i needed help finding anything. i was impressed by their non pushy sales approach and also their extensive knowledge of their products. i will definitely be purchasing from here again!
i did a lot of homework in my search for a great deal on a 75 and a 65 inch tv. best deal in town simply cant be beat.  i went to all the big box stores, searched the internet for reviews and watched the ads for several months. you may find a better price in some dark corner of the internet, but you shouldnt be buying big tvs on the internet. buy it local so you can deal with someone mason in person if there is an issue. mason is a straight shooter and easy to work with. i came back four times to look at the tvs i ultimately purchased from him. he was helpful each time. he even gave me a recommendation for media shelf idea that saved me 500 aside from the 500 or so that i saved buying tvs at his store. i am totally satisfied that i actually got the best deal in town. now i just have to decide what im going to watch first. pacific rim, jurassic world or avatar !?!if you want a huge tv at the best price go here immediately. also there is a great accounting office next door in case you need that sort of thing.
an update spoke to the owner again and he said he stands behind his warranty even if its few days past due and he is willing to exchange it for me with no hassle he said bring it in and u will see magic , he promised i will be happyi believe him i m sure he will stand up for it thanks mason !!
great deals on tvs, customer service was great as well. will be coming back when looking to replace an old 32 tv.
ive been a fan of lush for many years  have been buying from them online. i was very excited to hear that they were opening a store in madison,  their store is awesome. the staff was super friendly, helpful,  knowledgable. if you are curious about anything, ask! i saw many demos while i was in the shop. im a huge fan of their bubble bars, i highly recommend trying them. i find that dividing up the bars works well for using over several baths.
what a great store! staff was very enthusiastic,  knowledgeable and helpful in a fun way! my arm was shampooed for a demonstration which was fun. the more i learned about the products the more i wanted to explore the rest of the store.  i am definitely looking forward to making it back in!
my love letter to lush,dear lush,i havent been able to stop thinking about you since i visited on sunday. i always love how good i feel after i visit you. you make me feel all warm and tingly, and you smell real pretty too! cant wait to see you again soon!xoxo,rachaelbuuuut seriously.if you love a company who really cares about its employees and the product they put it, give lush a try. im a huge fan of their shampoo bars and face washes. i love that when you buy a product here, it has a sticker on it of who made your product and when. it really gives you a sense that someone put care and love into the product you are about to use. not only that, they use real ingredients and not just a bunch of chemicals. i care about what i put in my body, but i also want to care about what i use to treat my skin and hair too.the gals who work here are super friendly and really know their stuff. wanna see how a bath bomb works? just ask! wanna try something out? there are samples everywhere.great company and im super excited they are in my neighborhood!
lush is everything! their products are perfect. once you get over the sometimes overly friendly the layout is easier than some other locations. i am so thankful that they are here and so close to my house! love lush! you guys are fantastic.
ive loved lush for 12 years. having one in my home city is a dream come true and the staff at hilldale are fabulous and fun! theyre helpful, genuine, and sweet. this place is my ultimate pickmeup!
love this place! the staff is awesome  so helpful and informative. i love the environment  very playful and good chance to interact with the product. my kids absolutely love the bath bombs, bath play dough and more.
delicious coffee and very friendly service. so much better than starbucks :. you can charge your phone while you wait as well android and iphone. my only complaint would be that my latte couldve been a bit hotterit was right at a comfortable drinking temperature, but i had to walk in the chilly weather for a bit. even so, ill definitely be back soon!
5star recommend ! good cafe with excellent service. i like their misto and mocha very much. a very cozy environment! really like the design. two bosses understand cafe very well and respect the culture of cafe very well, therefore their cafe is unique!
new name; new owner; new menu; and all are great!. we were fans of this restaurant before all of the changes and we are even bigger fans now after unknowingly walking in on the day of their grand opening last weekend.  the decor has been refreshed and table settings have been upgraded into a more elegant place setting, without charging you for it. sam and his crew are still there to make every guest feel like an old friend and the new owner, reena, could not have been more gracious and charming as we watched her meet and check on all of her guests throughout dinner. however, getting to what really matters, mint now has two chefs offering a new menu with the always delicious standard fare plus new signature dishes at very friendly prices.  the food was exceptional and i now recommend the mango curry tilapia which was amazing paired with the all too generous pour of their quality house chard.  cant wait to go back.  jf.
this restaurant is as good as it gets from the staff to the food, its worth every single penny. highly recommend the buffet , the food was flavorful. tons of variety and at a very reasonable price. there are lots of choices for vegetarians as well. my parents loved the vegetarian dishes.dishes i would recommend : chicken tikka masala lamb sheesh kabab bhel mixpapdi chat dosa its definitely a place i would recommend to anyone. the service can improve a tad bit but the food is worth the time.
best indian lunch buffet.. must try!!!
very good indian food. the service is very good. wait wasnt long. we were a party of about 10 adults. even though the order was pretty exhaustive, the food was served on time. the best part, special care and attention was given to kids! will come back again for sure! cheers.
high quality and consistent food. good ambiance. very tasty authentic south indian food
truly exceptional entry into the indian cuisine restaurants in the scottsdale and phoenix metro area.  conveniently located at the 101 and shea, its an easy drive, and well worth the cost of the outstanding buffet lunch.  unlike some competitors, each dish is freshly prepared every day  no leftovers from the day before.  that results in magnificent freshness and flavor.  if you enjoy great, authentic, indian cuisine, this must be on your must try list if you havent already discovered it.  for those reviewers giving anything other than 5 star rating  if not here  then where do you recommend?
okay so i went back to this place with my family and was amazed how much the food and service has improved since my last visit. the staff was extremely kind and the food was just spot on delicious! i cant wait to go back!
best indian food in north scottsdale!!
best quality food with awesome service ...
best indian food in az!  chili chicken and samosas were delicious! our server telly salavas was very personable and fun!! he made our experience very comfortable. we also had the korma chicken and cheese naan, very delicious. we will definitely be back!!
my wife and i really enjoy indian food and have been to quite a few indian restaurants.mint is, hands down, our favorite indian restaurant in the phoenix area.exceptionally fresh buffet with a wide variety of choices.well be back there soon.
had lunch with our family today. buffet food was outstanding! service was excellent!! highly recommend it. our family will be back for sure!!!
the buffet lunch today was excellent.   the variety of dishes..both north and south indian ..were well prepared .  the desserts and hot tea were an added bonus.  service was personalized and attentive.  good experience and would recommend this restaurant!!
the owner is gracious and delightful. the food is delicious. we tried and really enjoyed the signature chicken dish, the signature fish curry, and even the tikka masala was better than anywhere else. this is now our goto indian restaurant in scottsdale. be aware that the excellent chef is somewhat heavyhanded with the spices. even mild was quite hot, which didnt bother us but was a little too much for our friends. pricing is very reasonable about 20 per person with a main dish, beer or glass of wine and unlimited rice. we havent tried the buffet lunch yet....
mint indian restaurantfantastic indian cuisine and a maitre d  sam who will guide you to the best consumer experience you are likely to get in scottsdale.if only we could find more maitre ds like sam.
we had a very good time at the mint.  the food was very good.  the dessert was delicious.  our waiter chandrashekhar was very friendly and quick.  my little boy loved the mango lassi.  the manager came by to ask how we liked everything.  i highly recommend this place to everyone.
excellent  food and service!! ask for sam kojak for suggestions if you dont know what to order,  he will .   it is family oriented  on one side and romantic on the other.  love this place! !
we love this place!  we had the mushroom mutter, the paneer butter masala and the mutter paneer and enjoyed all three.  i always have rice pudding and theirs is one of the best ive had.  the happy hour drinks are great and only 5.00, we get the lemon drops that are fantastic.
i like to visit indian restaurants whenever i can, and this is one of the best.  the food is a little on the spicier side which i love, and has a south india flare  the dishes are definitely not what you would find at your usual indian buffet.  plenty of vegetarian and nonvegetarian choices, too. this is one of my favorite places, i highly recommend the lunch buffet.new ownership has improved both the menu and the resturantambiance as well.  five stars.
thanks for a great find yelp. looking for something new in our hood and this place came up. chicken fried steak was on point! friends with me said biscuits and gravy was awesome and so was the meat lovers. they need more reviews. fast, friendly, clean and great food with an affordable price. well be back.
nothing like getting treated nicely. its got a nice family warmth to it. great food and great customer service! come try this place out!
loved this place! used to work here and come here when used to be fast eddies! i love the new change and the new owner is so friendly!!!!! great food and clean place ! definitely will continue to come back :
very good fresh tasting eggs!  the strawberry banana topped pancakes were very good!  and you even get a free scoop of ice cream with your meal wow :the service was exceptional jojo !  i would definitely come back here.
i came here when this place was fast eddies and it was good. the cracked egg is probably a little better based on my experience today. i came in on a monday at 10am to avoid crowds and im glad i did. i was warmly greeted the second i walked in the door, taken to a table, served immediately and had fresh piping hot food in front of me within 5 minutes! dont know if fast eddie could keep up with that! service was great. refills on coffee, checking back and the food was great. i had the meat lovers plate with toast and added a biscuit and gravy. the eggs were cooked perfect, the gravy wasnt too thick or thin and the biscuit was nice and fresh. good coffee and boy did i leave full. will definitely be back to try the 4 or 5 different benedict plates on tree menu.
really really good food was really awesome first time here better than waffle house. i defenantly recommend this place i am buying a house nearby and wanted to try the local places.
at 1st look, i said, hmmnnnnn shall i dare? then i was greeted with an amazing waitress raven and i asked for her recommendations for the best omelette. she called out poncho!    fogetaboutit!!!  im a fan.
the cracked egg is clean with friendly staff and awesome food. penny is awesome as well. my spouse and i are addicted to the cowboy skillet.
what a great place. we just moved to central and glendale area and were looking for a real breakfast place. we have tried all the fufu and the pay for each item organic joints, but missed that simplistic eggs, bacon, and hash browns. this place rocks. our waitress was incredible! food was great. pricing is perfect. i have nothing but positives here! its really nice to have found something down here : happiness all around! meals ordered: eggs benedict with hash browns :denver omeletteeggs bacon and english muffinall three of us were very happy servers pay extremely good attention on coffee and all needs and we went on a busy sunday morning totally worth it :
great food, great service! this place has an amazingly wide and varied menu to choose from. i tried the farmers benedict and am in love! my fiance and i are already planning what to get the next time we make it in!
we live near this location and have been here a number of times, as well as when it was fast eddies. typical diner, but great service, clean, good portions, and tasty food. my fiance and i are regulars on the weekend when we dont feel like cooking or driving anywhere for a sunday breakfast.
breakfast was delicious,  i ordered build your own omelet and a side of corn beef hash. coffee was non stop and our waitress penny kept checking on us.. i recommend this place to anyone who wants a big breakfast and good service
i have recommended this great cafe to all my friends. the prices are very reasonable. the food is excellent and the service is exceptional.
visiting from la and we have so many restaurant options so when i tell you this is a great place!!!!! it is for reeeeaaaall.had the pancake, eggs and sausage...and stole some hash browns from my sister. my gosh am i full. so ooooo happy tummy
slipped into a food coma halfway through the meal. service is great. food is even better. wear your stretchy pants!
the food is amazing! had the california burger and hubby had the classic cheeseburger.  definitely coming back!
everyone was so wonderful and friendly! i would most definitely recommend this place! if youre looking to try something new,  green life cafe is the place to go!
wow! amazing coconut oolong tea. gorgeous seared tuna salad and fried plantains! i am throughly impressed. beautiful presentation as well. i will be coming back often and bringing friends.
amazing food! amazing atmosphere! truly a special place to have in madison! food is so fresh, they grow their own vegatables and herbs and fruit in the front of the restaurant. i will be back time and time again!!!
clean and fresh lookatmosphere.  dont love the current hours.  not even a huge tea fan, but i could see this place really swinging me away from my standard ice coffee.  reasonable prices, with great loyalty program and refill policy.  ownerstaff very friendlyknowledgable about products.
the woman working on 719 was so sweet and helpful. plenty of tea to pick from. definitely going to come here more often!
really nice addition to high street. no better way to start off an afternoon of driving around in the arizona heat then a 44oz ice tea. the staff is really nice and helpful. very knowledgeable about tea. jordanna had me try chocolate mocha  carmel java which was a complete surprise. my taste buds couldnt decide if i was drinking coffee or tea. keep up the good work!
this has become an almost daily habit! fresh tea and a great variety, dont care for coffee so this is a great alternative.
i popped into tea2go to grab a quick, cold beverage after running around in the az heat all day. their concept is amazing and you can choose an organic loose leaf tea selection from their wall full of so many flavors. see pic!  they will even let you smell them before choosing! the prices were definitely reasonable and the portions were very large! it was literally the perfect refreshment during a hot summer day. dear hq, please open a store closer to old town scottsdalecamelback corridor area!! : i would absolutely be a regular! they also have already brewed selections for a little bit cheaper if you wanted to quickly fill up a cup that way! if youre on high street, stopping into tea2go for a cold or hot beverage is a must!
one of the best tea places ive been to. love the multitude of loose leaf options and other drink options. the staff is very helpful and the teas on the wall are labeled by category so you can find teas that relax, energize, boost health, etc. great atmosphere too! very open, clean with a fun industrialrustic appeal.
super friendly staff and delicious drinks! we got the sweet chai with almond milk and the spiced cookie latte with almond milk, both iced. the sweet chai was amazing, as was the spiced cookie latte, although i think it wouldve been better hot i know for next time. great atmosphere and i cant wait to buy some of the loose tea.
the staff here is amazingly helpful and always in a good mood. i came in about five minutes before closing shame on me! and asked if it was okay to come in. the gals behind the counter were genuinely cheerful and told me to come on in whereas most places i would have received rolled eyes and exasperation. i asked if they had any already brewed tea left so they wouldnt have to make anything new on my behalf and they told me they didnt mind either way unbelievably nice. i ended up going with the coconut creme black tea which was sooooo delicious! i have tried a few other varieties here as well and everything is very flavorful, fresh, and never oversteeped! any true lover of tea needs to come here! very large cups and very small prices in comparison! i just wish there were more locations throughout the valley!!!
great addition to south end! came for the 70 taps that feature a lot of local beers, but the food was phenomenal. had a large group and sampled a lot of food. i highly recommend the peri peri wings, prime rib nachos, sliders, and pub burger. i dont normally order burgers at a restaurant, but the sliders and pub burger were extremely tasty. lots of tvs and a great patio with plenty of fans. opened by a couple local guys, and we were happy to support them. if you like good beer and good food, you cant go wrong here.
my boyfriend and i went on saturday to check out their grand opening and we were quite impressed. sure, the place was packed we went around 7:308 but we found a table and our server came over to us quickly. beerdrinks: theres something for everyone on their drink menu, from every beer imaginable to beer cocktails to wine and traditional cocktails. their price points were very comparable to other spots in south end for beer as well. food: very tasty pub style fare with generous portions for the price. even with the craziness of opening night, the food came out in a timely fashion and was prepared nicely. staff: everyone was friendly and kept their cool even though it was mobbed. the manger even came over and apologized for food coming out late, even though we both felt it came out in a fair amount of time. if youre in south end, definitely check it out. i know we will be back here many times for sure!
ive been here several times since they opened and find myself coming back! the bar is owned by two local guys and let me tell you, they are amazing. theyre walking around introducing themselves and checking to make sure everything is good and great. now for someone that can be overwhelmed by too many choices this place sounded like it would be anxiety ridden for me. fortunately the bartenders and servers are great. they let you taste beers youre uncertain about and they make great recommendations. there are 70 beers on tap! not only do they have craft beer, but they make excellent cocktails and have wine! i went for the soft opening and tried a few different items off their menu that they were passing around, everyone was great! they were nice and helpful. i was back again on opening day and it was packed for a monday. i tried the buffalo chicken dip and the caprese flat bread. let me tell you, those were excellent choices. the buffalo chicken dip wasnt too spicy or overwhelming. it was great! the flat bread was a good choice too. the next time i came for food i tried the cowboy burger and it was good, i got the cowboy sauce on the side, but i think next time ill have it on the burger. the brass tap is has a lot to offer, from different types of beer, cocktails, and assorted food on the menu; youre bound to find something for everyone. the atmosphere is nice and inviting. the tables are first come first serve, but they do have a nice patio with bar games like giant jenga and connect four. if there is a sporting event, make sure to come early so you can grab a table or a spot at the bar! make sure to try this place out in southend, its conveniently located next to a brand new brewery as well!
decided to check this place out one night. server was super nice and helpful, they have tons of local taps. we got a couple appetizers and the peri peri sauce is pretty good. its hard to describe but its spicy. the margherita pizza was great and so was the mexican chicken flatbread. we will definitely be back!
about 171 local and craft beers at any given time, wow! the food is delicious. staff is friendly. cant go wrong :
a good new addition to the southend neighborhood. good spot to hang out with friends, watch a game. servers are super friendly and knowledgeable about the draft selection. their brunch menu is super cool. i had guinness bacon waffle and they were awesome! definitely, this is going to be our hang out spot now on.
great food, beer and service.  the owners are locals that take pride in what they do and do it well! service is phenomenal to boot ask to sit in hbs section!
a great brewpub in southend, in a great spot.  the decor is spot on, and the patio is a nice size.  theyve got a ton of beer on tap, and a pretty impressive menu for the size of the place.   ive been through twice now, and sat at the bar both times.  bar service was quick and friendly, and prices were pretty good.  sunday brunch menu is limited, but very good  the waffle with blueberry syrup was delicious, and the western breakfast pizza was clever, and great to share.i also tried the pretzel pepperoni pizza off of the regular menu, which was a great one to share, too.
stopped by on friday  loved the large selection of beer! great service and atmosphere!
im learning to like beer and my server stefannie was so helpful!  she had great suggestions and was really prompt.  cant wait to come back!
i checked out brass tap a few times now since they opened and love the place. the tap list is second to none and they have always had something new to try...the beer menu is literally printed on a daily basis to keep up with the rotating taps. the atmosphere is great as a place to meet up with friends and hangout for hours. many reviews complain about the service but i havent had any issues and have been happy with my experience. i will put brass tap at the top of my list.
this place is awesome!! the food is delicious, the beer has endless options and the daily specials make me want to go everyday! dog friendly, lots of games and televisions for entertainment! the wait staff is soooooooo friendly they treat me like a best friend! dave the owner rocks!!
a very fun place; nice addition to south end. great beer selection and they have really good drink and food specials throughout the week. will be back
had lunch here the other day, bartender heather? i think, suggested the prime rib sandwich. excellent choice and great service. she was very nice. definitely will be back to try some of their beers on tap. they have tons. clean, courteous atmosphere. loved it
great addition to south end. great selection, great vibe and enjoyable staff. if you want to avoid the craziness of all american pub on game days, this is the place to go!
great beer selection and specials. corn fritters are a game day treat, the flat breads are yum! not your ordinary bar food place thats for sure.
this place is great.  patio is awesome and they always take care of my dog.  friendly staff and great food.  we live right around the corner and are frequent customers
they appear to have a lot of beers on tap and also by the bottle. not a huge beer fan but ended up here with some friends who were hitting up a bunch of breweries nearby in southend. they also have a decent liquor and wine selection. outside, covered patio with heaters. they have severaltvs outside and inside. the outdoor patio made for a nice setting to enjoying a few of the games and relax under the comfort of the heaters. the menu looks to have a variety of options. giving them a 5star based on environment, service and drink selection. didnt try any items off the food menu  i will have to come back for that.
had a great experience. accommodated our party of eight with no problem and were seated right at our reservation time. we did the allyoucaneat deal and tried a bunch of different items off of the menu. everything was awesome. the wet dream and one minute man were amazing. the staff was on point too and took great care of us. ill definitely go back here next time
all i can say is wow this place is the best sushi in  las vegas and possibly better than any other experience i have had..sushi is very delicious,fresh and pretty..i  was throughly impressed when i tried everything..all staffs are very kind, nice and awesome...i strongly recommend this place!!!i will say that you will not be disappointed in anything in this place..i already miss all food what i tried today!!!
this place is great. fast and friendly staff, i swing by for lunch every once and a while when im at work and i get the same consistent service every time. definitely would recommend this to everyone.
i ate dinner on forth of july with my family.it was very delicious and good quality fish.best all you can eat in las vegas .awesome,kind and very nice customer service!thank you to her and chef!!!
the sushi here is very good i have never been disappointed with the service or the quality of sushi. the moon dog and something special were really good
super good sushi!!!! come here fish is super good!!!! bring your whole family!!!!super food service and no wait!!!
i am so happy this place has new owners. went here around 5 pm for ayce 24.95 for dinner starts at 3 pmclose. this place has turned into a little secret gem in summerlin.we were seated right away at a table by choice. the service was outstanding. waitress took our drink order as soon as we were seated. kirin light large 6.00. the menu is huge and the waitress was back right away to take our order. we ordered a ton of stuff, so i am not going to embarrass myself by listing it. everything was so fresh and what i loved was that they were light on the rice. most ayce give you so much rice. the only complaint i have not sure if its legitimate is that i ordered the screaming organism and i am used to the one at sushi fever so i was shocked when it arrived and was only 4 small pieces. i hope its not that small if someone ordered it that was not doing ayce. but i will say it was excellent. i will def. be returning t this place. they were so nice and the fish was cold and so fresh. if you are looking for a new ayce check this place out. they have been open a month.
outstanding service!! so friendly and very welcoming!! the sushi was fresh and delicious!
the food was excellent. it was the best octopus ive ever had. you cannot skip the gerry roll or the johnny roll. the atmosphere is great and the service was good. the ayce was priced well and the rolls were not overstuffed with rice. will definitely come back.
i love the all you can eat sushi here. its always delicious. the salmon and tuna here are extra tasty. the staff is always very nice. ive been here probably a dozen times and no complaints! its a conventions location if you live in summerlin.
this place is so good! our favorite is the jackpot roll. its unlike anything ive had here in vegas. my favorite place was i love sushi but now this is my go to spot. it never tastes too fishy, the service is great and the food is the best part. ayce is at a good price and the options are amazing. usually ayce options arent that great but this place offers tons of different rolls and even a screaming orgasm which is bomb too! we live about 30 minutes from here and the food is well worth the drive! everyone should go check it out!
the service here is great. we came in when nobody was here. the sushi was some of the best i have tasted in a while. the ambiance and setting of the place is well fitted with all of the japanese artwork and pictures. the only true complaint i have is that it is pretty hot in the restaurant; however, there are a few fans running. i hope to return here sometime soon
i love this place!!! my mother and i come often..... and easy alllllll u can eat! i leave so full and satisfied. thank you my sushi
great place to visit. the staff are very friendly and the fish is very fresh. the ayce is a good price. they play great music. i have been eating sushi since i was four years old so i know good sushi when i see it. i gave it five stars because it met all of my expectations for a sushi joint. i 100 recommend this place. come check it out and i assure you you wont be disappointed. i will definitely be back.
great service, food, and atmosphere. if you are looking for a quiet simple old style sushi place this is it. its like your own neighborhood sushi chef.
a very good sushi restaurant, the place is very clean with the food is fresh.when you come you should try the o.m.g, crispy pong pong and wagon master roll

omy sushi consistently delivers an amazing experience every time! my brother originally showed me this cute little spot! they have all you can eat sushi, with a huge range of rolls that are perfectly crafted and absolutely delicious! i always sit at the bar, and the sushi chef con is so nice and friendly always making jokes and janie the waitress is so sweet and nice ! they  make my experience so much more than just about good food. at omy sushi they have a very unique roll i have never had before, its called the red rock roll, i have attached a picture. the jackpot roll is amazing and also the snow white!! all my favorites. i love this place!!the fish is always fresh and delicious! presentation is 5 stars for sure!
the summerlin roll  spicy tuna, tempura and unagi  need i say more?  friendly and excellent service in a casual atmosphere makes o my sushi a neighborhood treasure.  lunch or dinner  the food is excellent and the all you can eat option is both exciting and a bargain.
amazing tasting sushi at great prices. i ordered my normal philly roll and the cheese tastes fresh and the salmon was perfect. then ordered 3 piece sake sashimi and the pieces were avg to above avg in size and were very tender and perfect. next was halibut sushi that was sweet with the perfect amount of little chopped scallions on top. i did not get the all you can eat menu but its very well priced at 24.95 for dinner which is inexpensive in this area. great atmosphere and other diners seemed to be having a great time with a group of 8 ladies enjoying a birthday i believe. one pet peeve i have is always having something to drink and the lady who was taking my order always made sure i had a full glass of water to drink from which is perfect.thank you! i will be back!
fantastic service! a nice relaxing ambiance and great food. theres an option for all you can eat or a la carte. i did the a la carte with tempura, sashimi and the blue ocean roll. so good.
i have been to a lot of sushi places in vegas and this by far is my favorite. our waitress was by far the nicest waitress my girl friend and i have come across in a very long time. im happy i live less then a mile from here ill be back.
the vegetarian options are very nice with lots of variety. the service is friendly and fast. the green roll was my favorite. the all you can eat menu is huge and affordable. the restaurant is very clean and cute adorned with decorative fans and posters. i would definitely come here again.

a great night out having  the best sushi. service was excellent and cant wait to go back
this is my place to go when i just want to grab some good sushi quickly. i usually come here alone and sit at the sushi bar. everyone is friendly and i love the sushi! my go to rolls are spicy hamachi, candy roll amazing! and screamingo. they also have all you can eat lunch 11am3pm 21.95 and dinner 3pmclose 24.95
ayce for 25we came here around 34pm and nobody was inside. we walked in and only seen the chef there so we seated ourselves but within a few seconds our server came by to take our order for drinks. we got all you can eat and majority of their rolls were pretty good, better than most places ive been too yummy sushi grillkobe all the rolls we ordered came out quickly! it was one after another, we got done with one set and the next one came out. spider rollkiss of fire were both amazing the johnny roll isnt like the ones other places make. the tempura part felt really empty and all i could taste was cucumber and the tempura.seaweed salad was fresh and wasnt watery like some places. service was good, she stayed on top and made sure we were doing fine. i would come back if im in the area again!
this was my sons first sushi experience and he loved it! this will become our regular sushi spot!
very extensive selection of rolls, we tried at least 8 rolls and all were amazing. we couldnt find one roll we didnt like. it was our first time here doing all you can eat of course and everything was great. the staff is extremely friendly and attentive and knows the menu very well. you can do half rolls on many of their rolls as well. my boyfriend has an avocado allergy that we informed them of in the beginning and no matter who we ordered with we received not one dish with avocado on it which is very important and quite impressive. this is a great location and will be our new go to sushi spot for a great all you can eat. overall great experience, no complaints whatsoever.
good sushi, good ginger dressing , prompt service . we love the japanese lasagna roll .
this place was amazing !!!! its in a really good location and sushi was made to perfection. very friendly staff and excellent service
amazing service and great food!!! all you can eat is worth the price! highly recommend!

ive been coming here for years! ive gone to sushi restaurants all around the city and o my sushi is still my favorite! the heart attack  is my favorite roll! the spicy crab and jalapeno make an amazing combination. definitely a bang for your buck!!
the best poke and really fast and great service!! worth every penny! portions were small so i was able to try alot of their dishes. service was courteous. place is clean.
great little find. we are from california and know good sushi. this place is fresh, well crafted and yummy! our server was very attentive and helpful. we will definitely be back when we come into town.
we found this place on yelp and tried it because of the reviews. we eat sushi a lot. we had the super tuna roll, salmon, yellowtail, salmon roe, halibut, and sweet shrimp sushi. it was fresh and tasted great  best part was how reasonably priced it was. also, the service was fast and attentive. i highly recommend if you are looking for good sushi at a reasonable price.
great food. great service. great all you can eat. delicious. great prices. i loved the shorts ribs and the pink lady. the atmosphere is very comfortable and inviting.
love this place! our server, donna, was amazing and was very attentive! my favorite roll was the lion king roll. its the perfect roll for someone who is being introduced to sushi, or just wants that yummy crunchiness of the tempura. this place also offers allyoucaneat for a great price. definitely will be back!
ayce is miraculous. service is fantastic! donna is great! can never go wrong with the classics such as the philly roll and spicy tuna! the location is great, in boca park.
i come here all the time! the all you can eat is at a great price and i am never disappointed by the food. the service here is great and we never have to wait long for service and we are greeted as soon as we come into the restaurant. i have had almost every roll on their menu. the presentation is also always beautiful.
my husband and i have been coming here for ten years and have never had a bad meal. the food is exceptional and the service is out of this world. we love their all you can eat sushi!
some friends of ours invited us here for our first time and we loved it! our friends recommended oh my sushi and said theyve been coming here since high school. the service was great, we were welcomed upon entering and were seating immediately. highly recommended...
came here for my first time and the sushi was great.. i especially liked the fire cracker roll after i had a screaming orgasm then the o.m.g with my pink ladies rolls was amazing..i would recommend this place to anyone
i got the philadelphia roll and the nevada queen. and for reals, that nevada queen was extremely good. but all their stuff was delicious too! they do have soy paper for a substitute of seaweed
loving this place! nice small bit authentic setting. my test of a good sushi place starts with whether or not they shout irashaimasen!  when you walk in! they did.. had spicy tuna and rainbow roll. both satisfying.
delicious sushi and a friendly staff.  very attentive to the customers and provided excellent meal choices.  definitely coming back.
this place was hands down amazing. im not even through my meal writing this review and im already so happy.  service, quality, quantity, price it was all awesome.
our food is great! my family and i have been coming here for a while and will continue to. service and food make for a great time. :
excellent service. the caterpillar roll was the biz. highly recommended. i ordered the all you can eat along with my family and we had everything in the menu and it was to die! top picks are caterpillar, aloha, and ex boyfriend. we will definitely be back soon!
my first time here. great prices for huge variety of rolls and sushi. you can do half roll on many of their rolls as well. so i got half of something special roll, whos is your mommy, summerin roll and nevada queen. all of that is really yummy. their poki is really good. one of the most delicous poki i ever had at ayce sushi restaurants. the atmosphere is beautifull and very clean.
o my sushi is awesome! best sushi i have had in a while! great customer service. great sushi bar and very friendly with children. every roll i tried was very good and was just right amount. i will for sure be coming back! thank you o my sushi!
oh my sushi is right..decided to stop by after many times driving by. the location and interior decor is so comfortable and cozy deffinantly a good upcoming winter spot for me. our sushi chef was an amazing lady. so calm and collective, all her food and presentation was superb. some mouth watering flavours here especially the spoon shooters.....ermahhgerd magnificent.i recommend but make sure you choose a calm time to come and it is amazing service and pace.
this place offers all you can eat and also a la carte items, favorite roll was the sexy lady. its close to my house and prices are cheaper than average in my honest opinion based on places with this same quality. recommended!
loved o my sushi. the food was great, service was fast and efficient.  would definitely come back and recommend them as one of the best sushi bars in vegas.
this is a great hidden gem for summerlin. its hardly busy which makes for good service. the staff is always happy to see you and the sushi is fresh. it can get expensive if you dont do all you can eat, but regardless, love this place.
stumbled across this place by accident and was a little worried when i noticed how empty it was. the interior is beautiful, the music is great, but thats not the important part. after the first three rolls my wife and i both asked, why is this place so empty? weve been to many places where the sauce or the cream cheese on a roll are overpowering and thats all you taste. these rolls were just delicious and the flavors were well balanced. even the spicy ones werent so spicy that the flavor couldnt be enjoyed. my wife and i have eaten at many sushi places throughout las vegas and this is our new sushi spot.
the food was amazing! the service was fast and friendly. very much appreciated. my date was a hot mess. it was a perfect lunch date
great service , great salad. great environment : feeling cosy over here. i hope i will find more sushi restaurants like this in beautiful las vegas.  by the way the location of this restaurant is super good. nice mall
excellent service! great food and environment! would definitely recommend it to anybody who likes sushi or if you have never tried it before. our server was very nice and kind as she offered her help with choosing our meal
just decided to try it on a whim one day, and within the first visit, the rolls made o my sushi one of my favorite places to eat in the vegas area. not just one of my favorite sushi places, one of my favorite restaurants in general. rolls are simply fantastic, every bite delightful. service has been good every time, though they sometimes seem a bit understaffed. however, theyve always been warm and friendly. 5 stars, not even a question.
omy sushi is the best sushi in town for the quality and value.  the restaurant is located conveniently in the mall near target, ross, cheese cake factory and starbucks, walking distance to everything. omy sushi seems to be the place to go for lunch. while we have only eaten here for dinner, we can confirm that the sushi is not only fresh but is also reasonably price, in the evenings. atmosphere is good and there are big tvs for you to watch games. we typically ordered all you can eat dinners. presentation on their meals was pretty eyepopping. the screaming orgasms, baby rock n roll, poki and mountain roll was very delicious.
found this place on yelp and wanted to try it cause of the good reviews.  great service friendly.  kids were happy with the ramen.  me and the husbands had the ayce.  best rolls were the dragon ball and nevada queen so good.  poke was great and you gotta order the screaming o gotta try this place.
me and my wife stopped by love the rolls. superb customer oriented service. try the dragonball. delishhyou can even get yourself a free mug just by yelping something short and sweet. personally i had the shrimp tempura, the dragon ball, the lion king, and currently tho king of a fried philly roll and perhaps some green tea ice cream.
ive lived in las vegas for over 3yrs and tried so many sushi restaurants. o my sushi formerly tokyoto has never left me disappointed. the aladdin, kiss of fire, whos your daddy?  exboyfriend rolls are my favorites. they taste so fresh and flavorful. you wont even need soy!
the food is fantastic, the service is wonderful and the ambiance its very nice. i would come back again and recommend this place to others!
reasonable price for all you can eat in i hour. the food is good and fresh, friendly service.
dropped by on our week long trip.  pleasantly surprised with this little gem.  food is good, service is homey, the family loved the place.
this place is located in boca park and theres never a long wait. this place is nice and quiet. they have an all you can eat for around 25 dollars per person! theyre selection is good and they have many yummy rolls to choose from!!!
went shopping and found this great sushi place that has all you can eat! we were greeted as soon as we walked in and got to choose our own seating. for 25 dollars the sushi was good and i would say they have the friendliest service, for sure we will be back.
finally found a great ayce sushi place in summerlinnw area. the service was excellent and the fish is fresh and the rolls are creative. my favorite was the poke, tiger roll and the jungle jim roll. definitely get the spoon shooter. super tasty bite! cant wait to come back!
we come here all the time and they always take care of us! lindsey is one of our favorite servers she is always so happy and definitely keeps us coming back! its quiet, the food is great, and we havent had a bad visit yet! there are plenty of options for sushi around here but we choose here every time!!
first time coming here for lunch and it was amazing! it was 21.95 from 11am to 3pm. everything was fresh, presented beautifully and quickly served! some of my favorite dishes were the omg roll, screaming orgasm, baby rock n roll, and the spoon shooter! cant wait to come back here again and i cant believe its in summerlin!!! support our local restaurants and keep them here!
this place is so wonderful the service is absolutely amazing and it is always very clean. the sushi is so good and always fresh. i stumbled in one time and have come here for every sushi craving ever since. prices are very good.
very delicious sushi! very nice!! we got a few different sushi items and they were all great! happy and upbeat environment and good service. will definitely be back multiple times in the future! fantastic music made me want to dance, we watched star wars on the tv. awesome place!
we love this place, great service best sushi in town best value super fresh and a huge selection to choose from! i have eaten at many sushi houses in las vegas and this one is best by far. a must try lunch or dinner always great. thank you for taking great care of us!
this is my favorite movie theater by far! ever since they updated to the reclining seats, i go there all the time. friendly staff and clean environment restrooms are kept up as well as the concession area. its a must go! itll be cool when they open up the bar! too bad im not 21 : also great ticket pricing.
this was my go to theater for years! why? pricing!  and location. i have been coming here throughout the remodeling stages and since april have only been in the new theaters... we are movie junkies and go once a week at least!the crummy part is only 1 ticket taker. the plus is the kiosks! i always purchase my tickets online, plus i have a stubs card so its much easier! the seats are nice, and i love that you can now rsvp instead of fighting for the good ones. they also just opened up, mcmuffins i think which sells adult beverages.adultkids4.994.99 for movies before noon6.795.79 before 4pm8.795.79 after 4pm3 additional fee for 3dyay!
love the remodel!  the chairs are fantastic and recline quite a bit.  the spacing between the rows means you never have to worry about someone kicking the back of your seat.this is now my goto movie theater in vegas.
very nice luxury theater. movies before 12pm are reasonable. i would definitely come back with my family. we enjoyed the recliner chairs and the soda machines. thank you! i also bought the amc card which i think is good for families or anyone who enjoys going to the movies often.
wow. thats all i can say about this theatre.  it use to be such a dump.  the only reason we sometimes went there is because of how cheap the tickets were.  now they remodeled the entire place into a luxury theatre with reclining seats, hot food, and a bar.  they have the big coke machines with all the flavors with free refills.  the most amazing thing is that the ticket prices are probably the best in town.  evening tickets are cheaper than most places matinee prices.  hats off to amc.  as others have said though it can be dirty at times.  the concession stand was awfully slow last time i was there too.
newly remodeled everything, with good admission prices. they have made this theater into a luxury theater.
love this theatre, its cheap and the seats recline.  ive never found it to be dirty or customer service bad.  ive been early in the morning and to a late movie.  i like ordering my tickets with the app, printing them at the kiosk and walking right into the theatre.  4.99 before noon and only 8.xx at night, sign me up folks!!
i have lived in the area my whole life... recently they have remodeled and now offer a bar and reclining seats... best decision ever... its really helped the place and i love that the pricing is relatively in expense... i paid 8.49 for a movie on a friday night in a nice relaxing reclining seat versus the 1213 at other luxury theaters in town...
newly remodeled to stadium recliner seating. its way nicer, and the prices are much lower than the other recliner theaters!
man since renovation...wow!!! comfortable chairs, happy environment, and all brand new equipment! game over i am never going to a galaxy theater again. all about this theater from here on out. i highly recommend this theater to all movie goers!!
since moving to las vegas last year, ive discovered luxury theaters  rainbow promenade, sunset station henderson, and the cannery galaxy north.  of all these, amc rainbow promenade 10 is my favorite! clean, best prices, and you dont have to walk through a casino. also, i feel like not many people know about this theatre, and id like to keep it that way... helps cut down the crowds, yknow ;
great little theater, been visiting this location since i was a little kid. now with a new set up that includes a bar and recliner seats, this place just cant be beat. also movie tickets only go for 8.50
this place was recently remodeled and it is really nice. reclining seats, self service concessions and a bar. prices are below 9 for a night time movie. staff is friendly and attentive.
this was my first luxury theater. i went for mockingjay 2, soooo of course it gets 5 stars. really, coming from california, where you pay 15 for a fold down seat... this was amazing. it was 8.50 for an evening showing, in a frickin recliner, that was big enough to have my bag of popcorn on one side, my purse on the other, and my fat a in the middle!!! the theater was clean, as were the lobby and restrooms. the snacks were expensive as expected. i dont like that you put on your own butter, because you know you want there to be butter put on half way. they had little cups to put in in... but that seems like trouble if it busts. theres a bar in the lobby, which i skipped because the hunger games was my drug of choice for the night.i bought my tickets online a week ahead, which was awesome, because you get to reserve your seat. so you also dont have to get there super early to get the seat you like. there is a bus stop right in front for the 101, and a quick walk across the street is the 104. and a barnes and noble in the same parking lot.
i was certainly not disappointed by hair cuts and colors. i will be coming agan. she does great makeup and hair, so shes perfect for weddings!
so glad to have found you angela! thank you for bringing my hair back to life! the cut and color was perfection! will definitely return for a touch up, five star service all the way!

henderson mazda, henderson, nvfinding a reliable, responsible service dept for our three mazda vehicles could have been a long  tedious endeavor, instead, we were fortunate enough to find a service dept that stepped up to the plate and proved to have a professional, dedicated team in place.  not only did they take care of the mileage service call recommendations in a timely  courteous manner, but they also demonstrated their ability to provide top notch service and genuinely proved to us that our satisfaction was pinnacle to them.with peter g at the helm to establish a code of work ethics  a sincerity to listen to the customer, the henderson mazda on gibson is a breath of fresh air.  coupled with the enthusiastic welcome, from the knowledgeable service manager, joe d, there is simply no other place to go.  do not hesitate to pull in or give a call to see what quality service is all about.
joe defalco service advisor mazdawe purchased a mazda from another state and had it delivered on a transport.  immediately upon delivery, we stored it for two months until daughter received her permit.once we took it out of storage and gifted it to our daughter we started to notice things which needed to be fixed and other things that needed to be replaced completely. after we stopped by and talked to joe in service we quickly felt the issues we were concerned with would be taken care of. boy were they!  he made notes of our concerns, and what he himself could see.  joe personally called the dealership the car was transported from and set everything up with them for the approval to repairfix at no cost to us.with a purchase from another state we thought it was going to be tough to address these issues.  we believe joe went above and beyond for us.  we are extremely impressed with his professionalism and his constant follow up throughout the day; while he was having the repairs addressed in the shop.  we dropped it off at 7:00am and picked it up at 5:30 pm.  to top it off, he had the car washed prior to our arrival.we are grateful for the ease of this service. i dont know if different management took over or   a new buyout was done with this dealership, but when i saw the ratings i was shocked because our experience was wonderful.  we will definitely go back for any and all services needed on our mazda.

every time we are in vegas we have to come here. the food is simple and delicious. clean and friendly environment and fresh ingredients. the owner is super nice and helpful. we had the maklub, buffalo chicken pizza, margarita pizza, persian pizza and the bug yet farcie. everything was amazing!!!
the persian pizza was good, the makhlob which is a sandwich that is made on a fresh dough, was also good. i personally know the owner and i do recommend this place. things to mention: friendly atmosphere, 15 student discount, very low prices, healthy the vegetables and meat they used was fresh, the pickles they have khiyar shoor is awesome.  ask for a side of pickles. ;
ive been with one source for several years now, and couldnt be happier.  my agent, dede, has always been there for me to answer my questions, no matter how trivial, right away and is always looking out for me to ensure i have the best coverage and at the best rates.  i cant imagine using any other insurance agent!
dan bakley is very knowledgeable. he can provide you a very clear picture on where your health insurance gaps and what additional coverage you need. and its so inexpensive! his insurance services he provides gives you cash immediately when your need arises. its dirt cheap to fill in the gap! you wont regret speaking with dan.
most of us wait to the end to just find out that we do not have what we need after  get sick or in a accident , now is to late , i do recommend to talk to dan  bakley , he is a very knowledgeable person , he will provide you with the right health insurance . dont play with your family money , get insurance and i will recommend dan bakley .
petit cafe de quartier tout a fait charmant! jai mange une pizza dejeuner, qui consiste en une pate bien moelleuse, des tomates cerises plus que gouteuses et un oeuf cuit sur le dessus. tres interessant a manger sur le pouce!jai pris un cappuccino lait de soya et il etait mousse a la perfection! alors au diable les barista qui me disent que le lait de soja ne mousse pas et ne fait pas de bons cap!tout cela avec un service fort sympathique!
super cafe aux proprietaires charmants et tres gentils. le cafe est excellent et lambiance tres belle. a essayer, vous ne le regretterez pas.
ca faisait tres longtemps que nous attendions un restaurant de qualite dans ce secteur de rosemont. enfin, il est arrive! et pas nimporte lequel, le bebe de charlesantoine crete, vedette, produit du toque! nous lavons essaye au jour 3. voici nos constats : surpris, ce nest pas presentation gastronomique, mais bistrotaverne creatif, beaucoup dintrigue, il faut y retourner  le service est exceptionnel plateau de la mer, une fortune pour la quantite, mais super au gout carpaccio, les tranches tres minces debordent de lassiette et recouvrent une montagne de legumes marines, mayonnaise et de gros morceaux de parmigiano, a essayer bourgots, recouvert de legumes finement haches avec son jus, fantastique seule deception : cerf et calmar, cest en realite une salade et on sy perd, on fini par chercher le cerf et les tranches de calmar.cest honnetement super sympathique! une reussite complete.

wonderful dining experience.  friendly service.  excellent food.  portions were filling.  well worth the 20 cab ride from downtown hotel.  very safe neighborhood.  felt like we were guests in someones home.  the owner was welcoming, kind and even helped track down a cab for us to get back downtown afterwards.  will definitely return next time we return to montreal.
i am so glad that i got the chance to try this new place on my last trip to montreal.  simple words dont do the menu justice, the food is that good.  great variety, playful flavors, and presentation.   the cuisine is based on smaller plates that are easy to share.  i went with my fiancee, and we enjoyed a whelk dish, prepared like a substitute to escargot, which was incredibly tasty.  also had fried brussell sprouts that were simply amazing, braised pork, and tuna tartare which was the freshest ive had.  the service is equally as wonderful as the menu.  from the host to the bartender and the servers, everyone was incredibly warm and welcoming.  eager to answer questions about the menu and offer suggestions.  and i must compliment whoever designed the restaurant itself.  the moment you walk in the vibe is bright and cheerful, which also adds to the experience.  perfect atmosphere, whether you are looking to have a few drinks with a friend, a dinner date, or for a big dinner celebration.  altogether, a very memorable experience and i hope we will be back again in the near future!

everything was amazing! but you need to make your reservation in advance. the brussel sprouts were outstanding, and so were the cocktails!
extraordinaire neo brasserie. creative food but respecting the taste and the tradition. great atmosphere. must go restaurant !
amazing service with professional and friendly staff. and best of all they have great prices for all the services this spa offers. from getting a massage to getting your makeup done for a night out. something fun that this spa offers is makeup classes!!! wow this is the only spa that ive ever came across that offers that .. thats amazing !!! ..... very clean and organized atmosphere. also something amazing is that they sell a big selection in bags!! this is my new favorite spa!
amazing experience! great customer service, and outstanding staff! if youre traveling to vegas, i highly recommended vibe!
extremely pleased with my lashes. this was my first time ever getting eye las extensions. josette made sure i was comfortable and explained the process in detail. i highly recommend this place. not to mention they have cute accessories. not did i only walk out with beautiful eyelashes, i also walked out with a gorgeous clutch.  i will most definitely be back. thank you vibe for making my visit a great one. see ya soon!!!
i had the pleasure yesterday to have a facial at vibe, by the owner josette! and it was wonderful! the shop is super cute and the menu of services covers all my glamming needs. they even have a retail space with stylish hand bags and other goodies to keep you looking great! i had the deluxe doterra essential oil facial. i loved that there was an option for a natural chemical free facial as i have sensitive skin and prefer more natural options. josette was super sweet, knowledgable and talented. and the lymphatic, massage and hand and arm massage was to die for! i did not want the facial to end! my skin after was so soft and glowing, i will be going back regularly, josette is officially part of my anti aging glam squad!!
as a working mom  who almost never takes time for herself i finally decided a facial was no longer a luxury but a necessity and boy, i am glad i did. i made an appointment with the newly opened vibe studio and it was the best decision i have made in a long time. the studio has a hip, urban vibe that was reminiscent of a trendy, cool spa that would be streetside in a city like miami or new york but the real deal was the service. i still cannot get over the great facial, massage and service i received for such an affordable rate. the owner, josette was personable, professional, friendly and knew her stuff. josette is a pro  she has mastered the art of balancing the relaxtion portion while still educating of the client as she explained what she was doing and what products she selected. her knowledge, enabled to me relax and know i was in good hands.my skin was literally glowing when she was done, and this mama was relaxed and ready to face the world. thanks, josette!!! i will be back for sure, need to work my way through the menu of services vibe offers including the makeup classes and of course get another facial. :
this review below is for the facial at vibe lash and wax studio.currently there are coupons on yelp and on groupon. both cover lash servicesunderstandable at a salon with lash and wax in the name, but the expertise here extends beyond those two services.  i have had my share of facials and the energy of the esthetician is critical to my having a positive experience. i want to be in a calm and healing environment when i am getting a facial and vibe delivers that and then some.  i love that this is a family business. to see the commitment and real concern that this family has for customers and our experiences in their establishment set the tone for what would be a wonderful experience.the owner, josette, is warm and inviting and truly cares about her clients experiences. after reading my intake form, she took the time to start the facial by asking about my goals for my skin. understanding what the client wants is so key for a treatment dealing with skin. we all come to a facial looking for something different. and just expressing my goal for the session meant that she was able to tailor my facial to address my expressed needs.  that tailoring of services demonstrates a level of customer service lacking in many salons. she patiently answered all of my questions and offered me valuable information about my skin routine and what it would take for me to reach my personal goals.  and when she was finished, i left loving the soft glow of my rejuvenated skin. for my return business, an esthetician has to strike a careful balance.  dealing with skin and body treatments is intimate. and i need to feel that the person i am entrusting my skin to is professional and knowledgeable. even with those two qualities, i wont return for a second visit unless that person is also genuinely caring. josette embodies all of those qualiites.  i so appreciate her professionalism, trust her skill, and i am drawn to her warmth. i have already made my next appointment and i cannot wait to go back.
took my girlfriend in the salon and the staff was not only super nice but the results are out of this world.  i would definitely recommend this place to all my friends!!!
took a brief vacay to vegas, and was in need of a good facial.  stopped in, and was greeted by a very  friendly staff.  not only did i get a great facial, but i also ended up getting my brows and lashes done too. it was my first time having lash and brow extensions, and they turned out amazing.  the service was great, and the prices were right.  i will definitely be back when i am in vegas.
i just had a facial and scalp treatment from josette! it was an amazing experience and my face and scalp feel incredible. clean facilities, and a relaxing environment. i highly recommend vibe.
great comfortable place to be to enhance your beauty. friendly and adorable staff. love the little receptionist. the work here is outstanding and dont forget to check out the purses!!
if you are looking for professional, relaxing, very clean place to get your waxing or facials done. vibe is the place for you. im extremely happy with my service and cant wait to start getting my facials done here with josette on a regular basis. thank you vibe!
while in vegas i had the opportunity to stop by vibe lash and wax studio and get my first set of lash extensions and fell in love with them!! they looked so natural and didnt feel heavy.  i loved them so much i also asked for brow extensions.  those were also great and very natural looking.  just perfect for me since i have a small area where hair doesnt grow in my brows. upon walking in, i was greeted and the waiting area was immaculate and smelled delicious. i received my services promptly no waiting on someone else.  josette is very knowledgeable and offered suggestions on how to maintain my lashes and brows.  and for you ladies they also sell the cutest handbags, clutches and wallets!! i highly recommend vibe and i have already purchased a groupon for my return visit!!!
very professional, friendly and knowledgeable staff centrally located on rainbow between sahara ave  charleston blvd..  great vibe on the inside.  stop by and give them a try.
after not being able to find a good makeup artist for a decent price in las vegas...i was introduced to josette. she did an amazing job on my makeup and now i will never go to anyone else! shes friendly and great at her work! if you need someone, look no further she is it!
i went to vibe for a facial and it was such a relaxing experience!  i loved it!  josette was so knowledgeable about the products that she was using and walked me through every step answering my questions so thoroughly.  she made me feel very comfortable.  i would highly recommend everyone to vibe! thank you so much and i will definitely be back soon!!
what a beautiful studio! the first thing i noticed was how immaculate the place is. the second thing i noticed was the vibe no pun intended, haha! of the place. josette made me feel very welcome. she is very friendly and knowledgeable. ive had her do my make up twice now, and i love her work! the first time, she did a dramatic, dark, smokey, sexy look...perfect for a night in vegas. the second time, a more natural, flawless, sun kissed look. i highly recommend josette, she is an amazing artist! they have the cutest selection of bagspurses as well!
while vacationing in montreal, we came across cacao 70 cafe. the menu looked awesome, and it ended up being just that. had to have fondu, the dipping for it was very creative. my favorite was the waffle chunks. now i must remember to order a dish just with waffle next time around. our waitress, stephanie was very friendly and helpful. its great to be on vacation and have positive people serve you.
just opened two days ago, and i only had time for a drink. the house drink the smash was amazing. our server jason was awesome! definitely check out this new hotspot!
im excited about this new place! so far based on the two drinks i had, the service, and the environment, this place is getting 5 stars! grabbed drinks here while waiting for a table at le thai, and our experience was delightful. we sat at the bar and perused the cocktail menu. there were so many interesting, scrumptious sounding drinks to try, but i went with the pina colada, my favorite. this one had a particular appeal because it included banana liquor, which i thought would be a nice touch. my husband ordered the smash. both of the drinks were so unique and refreshing. not super sweet and not super heavy. very light, delicate flavors and very beautifully presented see photos for presentation obviously. the service was great. our bartender was very friendly and willing to answer all questions about the menu and was just an all around cool person. he had a lot to share with us about the chef, the inspired food and drinks and just regular human conversations. as we were walking by the window of the restaurant a few hours later, he waved at us. the fact that he remembered us is huge for me. when i worked in the restaurant business it was rare that i could remember a person. but he did. it means a lot to be treated like new friends than just customers. pina colada: i love this drink. i am always ordering pinas and this one was very different from the las vegas poolside original. it was not super sweet and didnt feel like i was drinking a milkshake which is a good thing in this case. the banana liquor added a different dimension to the drink and gave it an added tropical feeling. they finished it off with some shredded coconut on top, and i think there was some in the bottom of my drink as well, which was a nice surprise at the end. all in all, i really loved it. the smash: this one has all the things my husband loves smashed into one glass. the fresh blackberries muddled in the bottom of the glass with fresh mint leaves creates a refreshing, light, sweet combo. its almost like an adult blackberry lemonade. it is one of the fan favorites so far. my husband loved it as well. we didnt have a chance to try the food yet, but i took a glance at the menu and there are about a million things on there that i would love to order. so i will be back and add to this review, for sure!
welcome addition to fremont st.great value and good cooking.from the doorman to servers staff is hospitable and very well intentioned.tried the charred kale salad, beets lightly pickled in pedro ximenez are addictive. lots of tasty vegetarian offerings, curried cauliflower  dates are a bold full flavored. pig ears  oxtail empanadas are just two of the many chef driven offerings. ill definitely be returning to to try the remainder of the menu.
food, cocktails  service was amazing!  came in for lunch  cant wait to come back for dinner with my friends.  i tried a little bit of everything  it all was delicious.  must try, i highly recommend it!
hidden little gem! theyre brand new and the bartender was really nice. its a sunday night and theyre not dead so that speaks for itself. drinks are normal dowtown prices and the music isnt too loud so you can actually talk to the person next to you. ill be coming back!
the big sexy burger was out of this world! it was as good or better than any i have had anywhere at any price.the summer squash flatbread was awesome: baked on a thin croissant type bread not the regular pizza dough, making it very light and tasty. my wifes favorite was the shrimp scampi in a garlic butter sauce that she also put on the toasted bread that comes with it. simply delicious.for desert we tried the carrot cake which is a must try. we dont really eat carrot cake, but on suggestion of our server, we ordered it. it was almost too beautiful to eat, and tasted better than it looks! old fashioned cream cheese icing, and a scoop of brown butter ice cream made this our new favorite.the berry good sangria was a treat as well. the menu had lots of trendy items and several classics, the dishes we had were presented as though they were 100 dollars a plate, yet reasonably priced, especially for how good it was.we will definitely be back!
my third time at this hot spot!!!  i have tried many items, may favs are the street corn, smores dessert wtih bacon, and the big sexy burger!!!  my husband ravs about the salmon!!!  next trip i will try the steak.  i saw this at the table next to me and it looked amazing!!!!our server this last trip was robert!!  he was amazing.  he walked us thru the drink menu as if he was the bartender.  most places the servers dont know what is  in drinks other than ice!!!every person was friendly from hostess, manager.  to bar tender.the restrooms were very clean.
so excited to have this restaurant downtown!!! had the in the gnudi and carrott cake and they were two of the very best things ive ever eaten!!! i will be back tomorrow!!
therapy is located in the upcoming downtown area, parking is easy and affordable. from the moment you arrive you are treated like a vip by the hostesses and staff.robert our waiter was very polite, knowledgeable and focused on making your experience outstanding. i overheard other tables saying the same thing i thought...this is the best meal weve had in las vegas and couldnt agree more.im vegan so i wasnt sure if they were going to have something for me but they sure did! charred kale under the greens menu was fantastic. i ordered it without the eggs and bacon, best kale ive ever had. the roasted cauliflower under the social club menu was so good, done to perfection. kudos to robert for his recommendation on the fresh brewed iced tea.if you live in vegas or are planning to visit, this will be among the few you must visit. outstanding in every way!
therapy is a great new restaurant downtown. i loved everything about it! the red sangria was delightful along with the gnudi, yum! the service was friendly and the ambiance is hip and inviting. the red velvet chicken and waffle sliders were awesome. i will definitely be back soon!
excellent service. definitely not afraid to go out of their way to make sure the customer is happy. this was my first visit to the 2 week old bar, but i will be back. often.
we are las vegas locals and always try to support new businesses. we decided to head to therapy in dtlv. welcomed immediately. jenna made the most perfect drink. dirty beer. absolutely perfect. ordered popcorn....fried paprika peanuts and maple candied bacon. what? bacon and popcorn and peanuts???
everyone needs a little therapy while in vegas!  an oasis.  fresh and healthy food.  excellent service.
love this new restaurant downtown! we visited friday and it was packed! very classy joint.  im pretty picky with sangria but my friend and i loved the berry good version they offered.  the in the gnudi appetizer is to die for as well as the asparagus! all the plates are so pretty. the popcorn was okay. the big sexy burger made up for it...best burger ive ever had! our server robert was pleasant and knowledgable. cant wait for them to get a happy hour!
just had a meal here and it was good.  had the street corn, oxtail empanadas, truffled mac n cheese and their big sexy burger.  service and food was excellent
amazing place! the environment is a mixture  of classy and cozy.  the music was great only the best of pop. even the food was awesome, i had the flatbread squash and the shrimp appetizer both were delicious, i recommend it! roger was so sweet to me and my coworkers, answering all the questions we had about the place. we will definitely go back!
the owner was super friendly, and the food was amazing! my only recommendation would be to have a changing table in the bathroom, but i can understand since its more of an adult place
sitting at home bored  hungry... hubs  i headed downtown with plans to have a cocktaillunch at the container park.  therapy caught our eye  we decided to peek in. everyone was very friendly  welcoming, so we figured wed have a drink then move on for lunch.  after perusing the extensive cocktail menu we picked our poison and proceeded to be enticed to grab a bite.  im glad we did! i ordered summer squash flatbread and hubs got the big sexy burger. omg... so good!  mine was very good, but the burger looked and tasted amazing. there are so many other items i want to try that going back isnt even a choice... its a must! give it try, you wont be disappointed!oh! i almost forgot about the carrot cake with brown butter ice cream the gave us as a thanks for being nice customers. delish!
wandering through fremont street we decided to check out one of its newest restaurant, therapy. its in a perfect location mixed between a lot of bars with not very vast menus and an atmosphere to set it apart from its surroundings. the food and bar menu is impressive, a great selection and even picky drinkers and eaters can find something to enjoy. after much deliberation we picked a few different plates to try and share, i highly recommend the french dip and smores! we tried the meat platter, the pretzel bites, and mac and cheese and no complaints about any of them. the food is perfectly seasoned and all the sauces, dips, and gravies were mouth watering making you want more food for the dipping!with drinks, a full meal, and dessert our bill was under 100. we were sat right away with friendly staff who offered recommendations. the music was great, all the servers and busses were very friendly. i loved the chairs at the table, you should be comfy while you eat! this will be a great sports bar and a highlight this football season.
simply the best meal ive had in las vegas. the most delightful small plate place ever. each of the five plates i had were well executed and perfectly balanced. trust me on this, you will be very pleased.
my boyfriend and i loved therapy. the food was good, the service was great, and we loved the atmosphere. the bar was beautiful and the big front windows provided great people watching. hoping to go back soon.
oh my goodness! this place is fantastic.  the food is awesome. my husband had the red velvet waffles with chicken...yummy. i had the french dip!! mmmmm! my coworker had the summer squash flat bread! that was delicious and my other coworker had the big sexy!! yummy. we will definitely be going back to this place :. oh the carrot cake and chocolate cake was heaven in my mouth. you have to go here. best therapy ever!!!
probably the best burger ive had in vegas! everything and i mean everything was delicious! excellent service and dining experience!
so me and two of my friends went there. it turned out to be a diamond in the rough. my two friends had read great reviews so thought it would be a great place to eat. we all loved every bite. i got the burger and fries and carrot cake. my only complaints is the wait was a little long, but this is normal anywhere. and the carrot cake wasnt as great, only one of us in the group liked the cake. i think if they used regular tasting cream cheese frosting and had more ice cream and less cake it would be a hit.
great place. the ambiance is wonderful and the food is perfect for either a group party or a nice date night. must try the oxtail empanadas.
took some friends from out of town here on a sunday for dinner.  we all were impressed with the quality of the food and the service.  the menu is tapas style, but their entrees are certainly enough for lunch or dinner.  what impressed us the most about this place was the attention to detail in the food.  each dish had a perfect balance of flavors that made you want to savor each bite, and that is a rarity in most other  restaurants in this price range where quantity substitutes for quality.
loved therapy! i live in the neighborhood and feel that i never get to catch up on the new places opening but im so glad i got to go here. the menu is simple, approachable and fresh and the space is very inviting. no places on fremont have tvs at the bar so im sure it will be more popular once football season hits. my friend and i sat at the bar and had a great talk with shannon. she was genuine, honest, quick, and overall just awesome. had a peach martini which was not too sweet, just perfect and went down smooth. started with the cauliflower and street corn which was delicious, and had the scottish salmon as an entree.ive never had salmon cooked with the skin crispy before and it was incredible. loved the vibe, service, cocktails, and foodvery happy to see it in the neighborhood and hope it thrives!
this place is great. the ambience and food are on point. its refreshing to see a nice and upscale venue like this open in downtown. the only thing i would like to see improving is the food portion is a bit small for the price being charged. the best part of about this place is that it turns into an unltra lounge at 11:00 pm which makes this place a great choice to grab a drink.  the resident dj puts together great sets of music to compliment the ambience of the venue. all of us have thoroughly enjoyed our time here because of this new change. take a visit, youll love the food, drinks, ambience, especially the music. i particularly dont understand why certain reviews would even complain about the good music being played here. its downtown las vegas, without good music, why even bother?! hatersaregoingtohate
this place is insanely good!!!!great customer service n amazing food!!!awesome music sets are spinning by their resident dj after 11:30pm!!!i will definitely go back again for the drinks n food when hes spinning..i would recommend this place to anyone n everyone!!!:
after a bad first experience, i was contacted immediately by the management team to talk about the problems, and was invited back in to give it a second chance with a guest. i appreciated the quick follow up, and of course was willing to go back and see how they could turn it around. my friend and i who were there the first time came back in for lunch on a wednesday afternoon at 12:30pm, and the 2nd time around was 100x better than the last of course. it wasnt very busy, but our food came out very quickly, which im sure was not a coincidence since that was a huge complaint of mine last time. we each started with a salad, i with the charred kale and poached egg, and she with the caesar. we split the pretzel appetizer the cheese mustard sauce is amazing. we split the side of mac n cheese with bacon on the side for her, which was successful in execution this time, and then were surprised with four desserts that came out. the fresh sorbets were a delight, i believe they were cherry, key lime, and passion fruit. the popular smore cast iron skillet was among them, which was far too sweet for me, but she liked. the decomposed carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and brown butter ice cream was a pleasant surprise for me, and made a great breakfast the next day! the manager also brought a chocolate ganache torte type ensemble out in a to go box, which was really just indulgent and over the top, but we appreciated the effort and it did get eaten a couple days later : the food was much better, the service was great, and we had a chance to chat with the chef and management. of course it was a comp meal, but not everyone makes the effort to remedy a bad dining experience, and they really went above and beyond to make sure we had a good time the 2nd time around, and the vp of ops even followed up that afternoon with a phone call. now thats hospitality.
amazing food, super bubbly and nice owner.  the house cocktails are small but the food is amazing! had the corn, burger, and shrimp scampi.
my second visit; first with 10 friends, last night with 8. every person in our group loved the food  same as last time. the food is very good, and the space is gorgeous.we were greeted warmly on arrival as my group staggered in one or two at a time. our server, robert, was warm and personable yet still gsd. the frozen mango  lychee sangria was good, but the traditional sangria was excellent. i wouldnt have thought to try sangria here, but my friends were enjoying it and i quickly figured out why. i absolutely loved the pretzel bread with an incredible beer cheese sauce and the lime creme fraiche with the oxtail empanadas. the flatbreads are a little small, though delicious. if youve got a big hunger on, go for the excellent big sexy burger for 14 personally, i think this might be priced a little low for a huge perfect burger with fries. the double pork chop is huge, juicy, and absolutely perfect.try the smores and the carrot cake from the dessert menu. be sure to ask for the bacon for the smores.
wellselected menu items pair nicely with beverage selection. concept is to provide food and drinks to inspire social interactions and conversations. the food menu is inspiration for conversation. fried pig ears with truffle honey mustard are delicious. full menu until 11 pm, then happy hour menu until 12:30. at the time we went, they had a sale on the back bar beers. 12 oz for 3 and 20 oz for 5. awesome staff, good attitudes. try this place out for something different in vegas.
love this place! the food and drinks are very well done!! the owner jared came outside while we were looking at the menu in the window and personally invited us into his restaurant. we were not disappointed! its in a great location in old las vegas. give it a try!
this is downtown done right  heck, this is anywhere done right.  the architecture and design of the room are subdued and cool, but very inviting.  the split level is intriguing, and i hope to be back with a large party soon so i can enjoy the loft.  the kitchen is on full display which is good, because the food is certainly the star; gunned, ceviche, and chicken with red velvet waffles are just a few highlights.  the restaurants laidback vibe is driven by the staff who i found to be warm and friendly, as well as helpful in navigating the options.  located right on fremont street, therapy will do very well  go early before they get mobbed.
ive taken a group here twice, but stopped by before the dinner crowd at the request of 15yearold aerrow, who loves the bacon smores. that dish is delectable  sinfully satisfying.i had my favorite, the big sexy burger. it was cooked perfectly, and the flavor was sensational, as always. ill never eat cheese on a burger again unless its brie...this burger is phenomenal. the mac and cheese wasnt carson kitchengood, but it was decent. i love this place,  and find myself wanting to come every week. the surroundings are gorgeous. and my eye is always drawn to that loft  whats up there? next time.
last night my husband and i were in search of a place that served delicious drinks but also affordable. we found it! therapy reminded both of us of our favorite place back in fort collins that is laid back and inviting. we didnt get a chance to try the food but we will next time! we will definitely be back. great drinks and service!
friendly and amazing wait staff and bartenders! food was really really great! french dip was excellent no fat and au jus wasnt oily at all. salmon melted in your mouth, the presentation was artful. try their coffee it was really flavorful, over all just an amazing place!!
fabulous restaurant  from the staff to the food. the decor is urban with a rustic flare. the food was flavorful and the portions were perfect for two people to share in a social setting. the chicken and waffles and the scampi were delicious. the deconstructed carrot cake was also on point. the owner stopped by to ensure our satisfaction. this is a place i would recommend to anyone looking to have a meal with a small group of friends away from the madness of the strip or even to rent for an event space.
might be one of the best restaurants in downtown. try the gnudi or the pretzel bites. everything on the menu is really good! love this place!
service and food exceeded my expectations. would definitely recommend this establishment for any type of enjoyment! and will absolutely go back!
this place is amazing.  we got the corn, the bacon and white truffle mac n  cheese,  chicken meatballs, oxtail empanadas, i know i spelled that wrong,  and the cast iron smore.  all so good. small portions but totally filling. the server mike was awesome.  you have to try this place.
after seeing the red velvet chicken and waffles slider i knew i needed to dine here. i went pretty early, around 1 or 2 pm on a saturday. the food came out quickly and the chicken and waffles surpassed my expectations. i was worried the waffles would be too sweet and heavy but they were actually really light and savory. the fried chicken was moist and whatever sauce they put on it was great. my fiance got something and it came with these truffle chips. oh. my. god. amazing. definitely would come back whenever im downtown again.
i think ive been back 3 times since my last review. the big sexy keeps bringing me back, but everything ive tried has been very good. the double pork chop, medium rare, is incredibly large, tender and moist  perfection when it arrives medium rare!looking forward to checking out those big screen tvs with a couple of girlfriends during the packers vs hawks and patriots vs hawks games. the loft looks so inviting, as does the bar. love this space  i think i mention it in every review. check it out if you havent yet!i was only disappointed when the female manager questioned us as to whether we had informed the server whether we were in a rush. there were 2 tables seated besides ours, and we waited 40 minutes for our meal. we werent in a rush when we got there, but were by the time our meals arrived! the female manager made us feel like wed done something wrong by questioning us when it was obviously a problem  never a good way to treat clients.wont stop me from going back for another big sexy!!!
i never write yelp reviews but everything we tried at therapy was fabulous and the customer service was great. highly recommend for a date or a relaxed night out with friends.
this place is legit!!! beer selection is not bad. must order the sangria. also, if you are hungry, the red velvet waffles  chicken are to die for.
fantastic drink menu!  fabulous service! wish i could have stayed for dinner.
really cool place to eat. the staff was friendly and accommodating. we brought grandma in her wheelchair and they were so helpful with out making us look like a problem. the food was so different and yummy! first time ive had a sunny side up egg on a pizza and i loved it!!!!! everything was delicious and a really fun warehouse setting.
one of my new favs! loved the atmosphere, food and amazing location!!! the staff was very attentive and friendly. i loved how everything we tried was different. it had its own unique flavors.
last night i had the privilege to have a tasting menu  therapy!  ummmm wow!!!!  there is an impeccable array of choices and very unique dishes along with some classic favs!  some of the things i may have never chosen on my own were just so yummy and popped with serious flavor!  this upscale barrestaurant just raises the bar for downtown cusine hang out spot !!  as someone who is born and raised here in las vegas this is a must try!!!  a definite hands down positive recommendation!! from the food to the staff..... exquisite!!  you wont be disappointed!!!

walked in while staying on fremont! beautiful interior loved the big screens for football. enjoyed the football specials would definitely recommend the chicken wings! met jared the owner very nice told us about his journey to opening therapy. definitely recommend this to anyone looking for some amazing food and great company.
if therapy can be achieved in the form of a meal, then therapy restaurant las vegas delivered on just that.  this east fremont street restaurant offers unique flavors for even the most finicky new yorker.  from roasted cauliflower to charred kale salad and scottish salmon with fine herb pesto, each dish was not only delicious, but exquisitely prepared.  other musts are the sumptuous desserts such as the specialty carrot cake to a memorable grown up version of smores.great service, great vibe and awesome beer.  for locals and visitors alike.
excellent ambiance, great service, and superb food! we had the organic chicken, oxtail empanadas, and prime rib not disappointed at all. managers and staff checked on us frequently... great way to spend our last night in vegas :
this place is fabulous. the menu has very unique items that are delicious. the manager roger treats this place like his own. we felt like he had invited into his home. we will definitely be back and recommend this restaurant to all of our friends.
it was a wonderful day date with my lady. what i loved about this place ...excellent customer service, college football games, inviting atmosphere, tasty drinks. if you like bloody mary cocktails, try one here.
therapy is wonderful! the atmosphere is great casual and modern, great for a date or a family dinner. i ordered the filet frites and the waiter brought out the chocolate cake, carrot cake, and smores for my family. all three of the desserts were amazing and the service and pace of service were perfect!
my friend and i couldnt take another boring convention lunch and saw this perfect gem on yelp. the concept is really hip and playful. our host roger was delightful and full of great recommendations. the drinks and food are the bomb. had a fuhgettaboudet cocktail and the big sexy wagyu burger. wish we had this where we live. good time guaranteed!
went back for another big sexy burger. did not disappoint. best burger in town. its huge!my wife had the roasted organic chicken again, and was wowed. one of the only places where we dont share food as we both love these 2 dishes so much. i have not had a better burger anywhere and i try them everywhere. carson and gordon ramseys burgr are a close 2nd.  the specialty drinks at 10 were really good.
everything about this place is great. super happy we stopped in. caesar salad was excellent.  carrot cake crumble was excellent. service was excellent. coming back again before i leave vegas.
this place is amazing. even more amazing? the staff. shannon was super personable and extremely knowledgeable. incredible customer service skills, made me feel right at home. definitely going to be a returning customer because of her. top shelf drinks, food and company. great ambiance. 5 stars!!!
very upbeat atmosphere! food to die for! staff was friendly, attentive and helpful. the charred kale was super yummy and the pina colada was excellent! price wasnt too bad either. i would definitely recommend eating here.  you wont be disappointed.
this is a great hip place for the younger crowd, although i did see plenty of older folks enjoying it as well. the staff was super friendly and definitely cared about the service and their food. we met kevin the assistant manager, who was very nice.onto the food. every dish has great modern flair. we had the caesar salad, with what tasted like home made caesar dressing. then the pretzel bread with a great tasting dipping sauce. my husband had the french dip, which was very flavorful. i had the chicken with red velvet waffles, which were amazing! they also have a good selection of beers. highly recommend!
delicious food, great service, and yummy drinks. place has a cool atmosphere and food is fresh and tasty.
i cannot get over how nice and accommodating the staff is at therapy. whether meeting up with clients or just dropping in for a quick drink, they are so pleasant! the food is also killer and meant to be shared which is great when you want to try a little of everything which i strongly recommend.
let say this, i was looking for a place to take my wife for a nice dinner and drinks.  this place is the bomb.  the food is excellent, not to mention the service is second to none.  a must try here, are the dates, macaroni and cheese and burgers.  trust me these foods may sound like every other restaurants, however everything is made with a twist, and extremely tasty.  extremely clean, a must visit when on fremont.
amazing dinner, amazing service from georgie and the independent wine selection is great. i love the atmosphere as it reminds me of trendy restaurants from back home in manhattan. if it comes back on the menu i recommend the rib eye with the red onion jam and the chicken jidori was bursting with flavor that will arouse the senses!
love, love this place! service is outstanding a great new addition to fremont east! you have to try the chicken and red velvet waffles! delicious! and the carrot cake was to die for. as locals with the ability to eat just about anywhere in town i can say we will be back!!
amazing drinks  tapas!  owner jarred has a passion that shines through in everything.  service was excellent from start to finish!  this will be a regular stop on all our visits to vegas.
great service, great food. hands down best dinner we had while in vegas. atmosphere is fun and lively. thanks jared for the drink. bartender rocked it!
the best lunch ever. here is my list of must try items. the french dip with truffle fries was so good, the ceviche, empanadas, cauliflower.  the best dessert ever was the carrot cake. dont let the way it looks fool you. everything listed above was amazing.
when you move to a new town you explore  and when exploring leads you to a fabulous new restaurant in downtown fremont, its like you won big!my girlfriend is in town from sf, so we had some big foodie shoes to fill with finding places in vegas to show her  i was up for the challenge and enjoyed bringing her outside of the usual vegas strip scene to fremont.we went first to oak and ivy  my favorite bar so far  which she loved, and immediately hopped onto yelp to find a local restaurant near where we were walking... enter: therapy.service: phenomenal. our bartenderserver manny was so friendly and descriptive of the menu. he knew each item, which he would refer, and took us on our first journey through their new menu seamlessly. the other wait staff never hesitated to refill water, check on us  the manager on duty came by and welcomed us to vegas. food: we were floored! we had bourbon blackberry cocktails called the smash  and im not the one to usually enjoy bourbon. we all shared a bunch of appetizers and food items including the chimichurri skirt steak with crispy onions, red velvet chicken and waffles, the pretzel bread bites, roasted asparagus and roastedcharred kale.... the steak was so tender...the bread bites made in house with a beer cheese sauce...and the roasted veggies were devine. the red velvet chicken and waffles had juicy chicken and the waffles werent too sweet or too dense...probably my favorite chicken and waffles ive had with two very nice sized sliders. we also shared the cast iron smores  and let me tell you, we added bacon which was the right choice and tore it up!scene: comfortable seating and a great style to the joint! i loved the vibe here and also the cleanliness!we definitely will be back to have some fremont therapy soon!
im giving it 5 stars because of the french dip...it was actually my friends dish...the chips were great too...my salmon was not so good, dry and pretty pedestrian...but the french dip...oh man.
what a refreshing change from the standard pizzaburgertaco fare downtown. we enjoyed the 20 happy hour discount and ordered the perfect cure meatcheese assortment.   excellent. different yet delicious. we split an order of mac  cheese which was flavorful and creamy. couldnt resist the smore dessert. i didnt care for the bacon topping optional but my husband loved the chocolate soaked bacon. i loved the perfectly roasted marshmallows so it was a winwin. service was friendly, knowledgable, and attentive.
we came here for a mid week date night and loved every moment. i walked in a felt like i was back home in nyc with the layout and decor. robert was a fantastic waiter and really knew the menu like the back of his hands. we split a caesar salad, in the gnudi, the nightly steak special skirt steak with chimichurri sauce topped with fried onions, mac and cheese and smores dessert. everything was wonderful and more than enough for two people. robert highly recommended the carrot cake but it really wanted to try the smores instead. ill definitely be back!
great food, great atmosphere and great service!  we went twice on our last trip to vegas during bike week.  my friend that owns a small restaurant in carson city heard about therapy on the local talk radio station  in reno and we decided to give it a shot.  tried all of the small plates and liked most of them enough go to come back the next night.  choose the ones that sound appealing to you and enjoy!  my wife also loved the pina coladas!  well be back next trip down south, hopefully soon!
roger is the best! georgie is awesome! the food was terrific and ambiance is wonderful! a true gem to the fremont street experience!
excellent. ..food is fabulous. ...drinks spectacular. ....roger seaholm is the very best  and georgie is the best waitress.....love this restaurant. ...
this place is hip with an attentive owner manager watching over efficient and timely execution of artful, tasty meal. the place is full of texture and cool vibe with an urban warehouse feel. we ordered the big sexy burger cooked to perfection, roasted cauliflower, empanadas, grilled corn cobs, and the red velvet chicken waffle dish. superb!!! well worth the drive to the original strip.
i never give out 5s. i tend to reserve that rating for exception food and service and with great pleasure, must give therapy a 5 star review!the establishment was clean and well staffed. the service was excellent and the food, well what can i say, the food was really, really good. not too over the top, not too mainstream but rather a new fresh look at basic favorites. the cocktail i ordered was well priced for top shelve and the bartender actually knew how to make drinks properly. therapy does not try to be something it is not, its basically great tasting food in a very nicely decorated space with a management and staff interaction you would expect in higher level establishments. understand your clientele and deliver good service and food. these guys and gals definitely know what the public wants and its refreshing to see for once, in vegas a place that knows how to deliver! well done therapy, cant wait till we return, and that will be often.jwp  north las vegas
one of the best meals weve ever had. the name is fantastic and we left feeling amazing and full. the food was fresh, unique, and so delicious. the owner was working side by side with the amazing staff to ensure an epic dining experience. they truly have a passion for perfect food. we live in az and this will always be a guaranteed stop when we come to vegas.
oh my holy yum this place has amazing mexican fusion tapas the mexican corn was simply delicious i can still taste it of my finger tips ! and the steak tartar .... ok im booking my next vegas trip and this resto will be the reason why
this place was amazing! everything about this place is cute and very relaxed. great food and service! would definitely come back :
the food was amazing and chelsea was an amazing server really appreciate the birthday surprise. would recommend again :
stopped by this spot for a quick bite to eat and was pleasantly surprised at the place.  super clean, professional,  and great service. the food was much better than i would have expected,  and the prices reasonable.   we split the french dip and ox tail empanads and a pair of beers. under 40. the attention to detail in the food presentation and the service move this from 4 star to 5 star.  our server, jonathan,  was excellent.   the music was great, and overall a vibe which is relaxing.   the people watching through the window is great entertainment.  will be back for sure.  great job gang...!
the best caesar salad with shrimp i ever had! the shrimp were huge and amazing! really awesome garlic parmesan flavor! also, try the elder melon sangria prepared by our awesome bartender keith! love this place!
i stopped in since i was in the area and had good things about it.  happy hour was going on so i got a beer and decided to try the oxtail empanadas.  they were fantastic with a crispy crust and full of meat.  the sauce was a perfect accompaniment as well.  since i hadnt eaten anything today i needed something else so went for the charred kale salad.  fantastic!  this is definitely going on my places to take my family list.
my mother  i dined here on a saturday night  even though we did not have a reservation they immediately sat us. it was packed! love the hipster but elegant decor  ambiance. we were greeted by our waitress michelle who was friendly, warm and inviting. her suggestions were the perfect cure, the chx  red velvet waffles  the beer mustard pretzels. all were so very tasty. therapy is a must try  i am now a fan.
great service and food.  sat at the bar and loved it. bartenders are really friendly and very helpful with the menu.  highly recommend
hands down best food ive had downtown. the service was great even though they were busy. also a big fan of the ambiance. super laid back, but welcoming. i will be back. also, do yourself a favor and order the carrot cake.
wow!!! fabulous find. great atmosphere. friendly staff. food is delicate and delicious. definitely for the high end pallet but priced very reasonably. met one of the managers and one of the owners which i always love. hit therapy at happy hour which was perfect timing! this area of downtown las vegas is definitely drawing great businesses and restaurants and we are so happy we found this! new favorite spot for sure! ps  try the oxtail empanadas, the chicken meatballs, and the gnudy. delicious!
great restaurant! roger is amazing and so helpful. we sat on the balcony and there was an east coast vibe. love it!
our supper club, the dining divas picks a new restaurant every month. i almost want to only chose therapy.  we had amazing time. roger, the owner took personal care of us the entire evening. the service, the food, the drinks, the music....everything was absolutely amazing.
came here sunday for bloody marys and football. bartender blake was awesome and served us up some tasty bloodys. 3 big screens at the bar with the games on. started with the ceviche which was delicious. had the chicken fried chicken sandwich which was awesome. definitely coming back for that one.
best french dip ever! michael moran took amazing care of us! great, affordable place to visit while downtown las vegas.
michael miran was awesome. even when losing his voice was very attentive!!!! super great service from beginning to end.  thank you michael miran for an awesome experience! !!
great bar!   nice tvs at the bar to watch the games.   blake was a fantastic bartender!very relaxing time with great atmosphere.
from our friendly greetings from roxy the hostess and the attentive jonathan ,our server, my wife and i had an unparalleled in years las vegas culinary experience. the food, atmosphere, and attention was truly fabulous. we had the homemade sangrias to start which set a great tone for what was to follow. we had three social club entrees; the chicken meatballs, red velvet chicken waffle sliders and the charred asparagus. all three were unique collections of flavor and texture. truly words are not enough to describe what awaits at therapy.  get there now before you cant get a table.
my husband was browsing the internet and came across a review of the restaurant. oxtail empanadas had his attention! so we tried this place on a friday night around 4:30 pm. walking into the place, we could hear ewf playing...positive sign 1! we were also greeted and seated by the assistant manager and he was awesome...very friendly and welcoming to the establishment.initially we thought this place might be a bit cold and pretentious just from the industriallike interior design, but once we were inside, i really liked the place. it had a nice, intimatetype of feel and the chairs we were seated in were very comfy! we were seated in the middle row of tables. our server was doubling as the bartender also and she was great! very attentive and friendly. positive sign 2!we shared the the perfect cure, devils on horseback, oxtail empanadas and fire roasted street corn. i absolutely loved the devils on horseback almond and truffle goat cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon in romesco sauce! the bacon was nice and crisp and it tasted wonderful. the street corn had a great lime flavor i was digging as well. the oxtail empanadas were a bit smaller than we anticipated, but they were delicious. and the perfect cure which is a selection of cured meats and cheeses hit the spot though i do wish they served it with more than 4 slices of bread. the food was great and it was just enough that we werent feeling like we were going to explode from dinner. positive sign 3!for dessert we had the cast iron smores. it was perfect for two people to share. we had the option of ordering it with bacon, so of course we did! ive never been a really big fan of smores because sometimes it can be too sweet for my taste, but i would definitely order this again. the chocolate and bacon joined with the toasted marshmallow goodness and graham cracker crust was so delicious! positive sign 4!for drinks, we ordered the smash! and white peach pisco punch. my husband really enjoyed the pisco punch and i liked my drink as well though i think i wouldve liked his pisco punch a bit more. we also ordered coffee with our dessert. the coffee was a tad weak, but drinkable. we take our coffee black and wouldve liked a stronger coffee taste. but its not a dealbreaker! :atmosphere  the music was on point the entire duration of dinner...we like our old school ewf, commodores, carl carlton, billy paul, gap band, etc.! it made for a very relaxing and laid back atmosphere which we really liked. we also met the restaurant ownermanager who stopped by our table several times to drop off some of the plates we ordered and also welcomed us to the restaurant. my husband made a point to let him know how much he enjoyed the music selection they had going at the time. lol. the owner seemed to appreciate hearing that. positive sign 5! everyone was very friendly. the service was great and the food was great too. loved the music during dinner and it wasnt played overly loud either. i will definitely be coming back with my husband. the owner said that for the winter, they will be launching a new menu within the next few weeks, so i am excited to see what they will be offering! i hope this place sticks around. theyve been open since around july.
french dip still has me salivating! amazing food and service, especially michael moran, who is the best! hes also soon to be a supporter of discovery childrens museum when he wins his 1000!
best i have had in vegas for some time! you have to try the corn...ordered it 3 times in one night!!!
full disclosure: as a grad student getting their degree in therapy, the name is really the main reason i wanted to stop in this place.im glad for the name though i think itd be interesting if it was incorporated more into the decor, because this is a really nice place right on the edge of cheesy but still fun! fremont st. we came in on a quiet tuesday afternoon and went straight for the bar to see what their happy hour therapy shots were. apparently they change the shot everyday and today it was a yellow cake shot, yum!their booze menu is something to write home about, its extensive and delicious sounding with totally reasonable prices. the staff is very friendly here too. the decor, though not therapyrelated id say is still therapeutic in its own way. the light colors and soft edison bulb lighting makes it very inviting and relaxing, which is just what youre looking for in a bar.i hear good things about the menu, and would love to come back for another shot of therapy!
had an awesome lunch here at the bar. great wine list!  the food and service were amazing. we tried the chicken meatballs, roasted street corn and roasted cauliflower. all were really tasty. holly  our server at the bar  was the best!  we will be back here!
great drinks, great service, great food! my boyfriend and i came here on black friday of all days  and it was warm, welcoming, and wonderful! holly was a fab bartender  we will definitely be back! thanks so much, therapy!! :
great place! nice atmosphere and awesome food. small menu for a reason, everything we ordered tasted really good and great presentation.
we were visiting from san diego. good food, get the red velvet waffle and chicken sliders! michael moran and the other staff were very attentive.
when it comes to therapy, i dont think there is a restaurant quite like it in vegas. the food is unique, it tastes amazing, blends tastes in such a unique way and offers it at such affordable prices. the staff is amazing, attentive, and courteous and you cant beat the atmosphere: a touch of modern meets classic vegas with a new york twist. great venue for a date, a nice night out with friends, or just an after work dinner. every time i come here, i try the good and faithful, then venture out. no regrets every time! love, love, love this place. and, of course, i like introducing new people to it.
therapy is one of my favorite places to eat. everything is amazing! try the chicken salad sandwich and in the gnudi. oh, and michael moran server was awesome... super nice and attentive!
what a cute place.  the food was good.  had a girls day out here.  manager was very attentive.
took my mom and her friends who were visiting from ohio to dinner.  we loved it! creative menu with a little something for every palette. service was fabulous and so was ambience. downtown gem!
from the moment we sat down we feel in love with this place.  the food is very good and the drinks are awesome.  what makes the place special is the staff.  blake and jose made sure that our visit was relaxing and enjoyable.  blake and jose also offered up tons of information about the surrounding area in the way of things to do.  if you are on freemont street stop in for a drink. you will be glad that you did.
im not even finished with my meal and have to post. this place gets 10 out of 5. food is great. the waiter jonathan was very patient. beer was good. football everywhere on a sunday afternoon. i am very happy i left the vegas strip and came to old vegas. i will definitely  be back.
as far as downtown fremont goes this place is great. we had great service and good food. prices are fair. the steak tar tar was awesome and the mac was really good. hungry and downtown i highly recommend.
i had a blast here at therapy.  i was recommended by my cab driver.   from meeting the owner, jared, to the chicken and red velvet waffle sliders!  it was so good, that i came back again for dinner and drinks on the same day.  note for jared:  keep doing what youre doing here.  also, my gf turned my vegas wife all thanks to you man.  i cant be happier.  i hope to come here again for one of your shows!
therapy is absolutely amazing. great ambiance, amazing food, and the service is fabulous. jason took great care of us and got us the best table in the place. georgie is one of the most friendly servers around. the drink selection is perfect and the fried chicken and waffles are to die for. ive been here many times before and ill be here many times to come!!
we stumbled on this place looking for somewhere new to try... we actually went to a spot next door... we walked in and sat down an no one even acknowledged us when we walked in and and for the 2 minutes we were there...that menu was very small and we were not feeling it. we walked out and was reading the menu for therapy posted outside. jason opened the door and came out to talk to us.... asked us if we were locals... and we told him yes that we were wanting to try some restaurants downtown but were undecided... he mentioned a thai spot across the st...but said that if wanted to try something different that their restaurant was zagat rated... and said some other great things about therapy.  we told him thanks and we would consider it.  he was very cordial... not pushy and went back inside.  my husband and i were still undecided... but because of the way that jason approached us about his restaurant... we had to try it!! we walked in and were taken by surprise on how unexpectedly nice the atmosphere was.   upscale.. perfect lighting and noise level... loved the way the seating was arranged and the colors used.   we tried a couple of drinks.. had the best caesar salad ive ever had, oxtail empanadas with a dipping sauce that came from heaven.... wanted to dip everything in it!  we ordered the braised short ribs which just melted in your mouth... and  the steak with a delicious mouth watering chimichuri sauce...both were so fricken good!!!!  portions were just right ... we were not overly full and had room for dessert. my husband ordered carrot cake... i am not a carrot cake person....but omg....  when they brought it to our table, i got so excited!! the presentation of it was not a carrot cake at all!!! this dessert was sooooooo out of this world good!! the cake was unexplainable... very moist and almost chewy like a brownie.... the manager, also a great guy.... explained that you should eat all the parts together... some cake... a little bit of the cream cheese whip cream and a little bit of the ice cream... i think he said it was browned butter ice cream.... yes please!!  wow!! the flavors and the texture together were perfect!!! i am now a fan of that carrot cake only!!!! i need to go back for more!!!! such a great place!!
i couldnt have been happier with my trip to this downtown vegas restaurant. my only downgrade was our reservation was delayed twice but once we were sat everything was absolutely perfect. our table started with the pretzel bread, stuffed dates and crostini apps. my one minor complaint would be the cheese sauce with the pretzel bread was a little bland but still decent enough.  for entrees we shared a selection of house mac n cheese, shrimp scampi, pork chops and braised short ribs we tried to order the steak but they had run out. the servers spot on recommendation of the short ribs more then made up for it. all of the entrees were cooked perfectly and were full of flavor. on top of the great food, our server could not have been more professional and attentive to our table. i can see why therapy has some of the best reviews in downtown vegas. the mixture of great food and top notch service is a must visit for any visitors to downtown las vegas.
this is a great spot just off the main fremont street drag.  both the food and drink selection is great and unexpected. blake, one of the bartenders really knows his stuff and had great recommendations. this place is a must try on your trip downtown.
after a few hours wandering and being touristy on the strip, we were questioning if wed be able to find a truly local dinner spot in las vegas. luckily we decided to head downtown earlier than originally planned and found this local hot spot. i felt immediately at home among the beards, thickrimmed glasses and flannel diners. the food was delicious, the recipes unique and the drinks on point.
excellent food as always.  michael from puerto rico was our waiter.  he was fantastic!  very nice and a good sport with us.
holly was fantastic, as well as the cuisine.  we overordered and the bill seemed too low. other than that, no complaints.easy 5 stars. recommended without reservation.
great little place ate lunch there chickenwaffles are fantastic. burger also yummy will be back!!
great great great find downtown! food, ambiance, service. perfection. we are locals and this was a nice surprise
great customer service. staff and one of the owners made sure all of our food and drinks were to our liking. must have: carrot cake soaked in ginger with homemade icing and brown butter ice cream. the chicken meatballs and oxtail empanadas plus dipping sauce were awesome!!! great atmosphere for any occasion. this is definitely on the list for locals and visitors.
amazing food and service was right up there. try the small plates, they are perfect for sampling and sharing.  had a first date there and the food was in harmony with a perfect first date.  brussel sprouts were amazing and the deconstructed carrot cake has left me wanting to go back for more.  ordered 4 small plates plus 1 dessert for 2 people and it worked out well.  i will be back often to sample their menu. the food and company was so good i completely forgot to post pictures.
i ended up here because the place i planned to go was closed. what a breath of fresh air! amazing ambiance, great service shout out to yancy and kyrsten, freaking fantastic food get the mac and cheese w bacon! and amazing drinks frozen mango lychee sangria!. ill be back again and again. i already booked for new years eve, and i am so looking forward to it!
very professional company.highly recommended.worked fast in a timely manner no damage on anything  i have a lot of fragile items,everything was covered by blankets ,plastic wrap  tie downs .very affordable  loved the fact that everyone spoke english.couldnt be happier.def. tell a friend
baringer moving services is an awesome co.!!!im somewhat a hoarder  they came in, helped tidy up, moved all my stuff wout any damage, wrapped  covered everything, their late hours helped tremendously since i work afternoons. very professional! i highly recommend this co. i was given a free 25 gas card. couldnt be happier
my move was not your usual move. had to use stewart and his crew at 4 different locations. from the 1st location to the last total distance was 20 miles. first two locations pu wrap and secure with pads loading a 26 ft truck. 3rd and 4th stops unloading same. total time under 3 hrs. the best part is there is no guessing. no hidden fees. no gas charges. no trip charges. everything is included in the hourly rate depending on 234 men. great service, no damage and they worked from start to finish. would use again for sure.
great gym.  small, friendly atmosphere but if you are serious about strength training dont let the small size scare you away!!  they have dumbbells up to 150 lbs and everything you need to train hard!!  staff is awesome!  everything is brand new and they have it all!  i am leaving a large, iconic gym in gilbert area because recent changes have ruined it but i was thrilled to find this little gem that has everything i need!!!!  tyler johnson helped set up my membership and he was awesome!
small, clean, great variety of equipment,  friendly staff, great experience here as with all the fitness 1 centers. way better than a la fitness or as my boy put it the walmart of fitness centers  lol!
best gyms in the valley! mainly on the nw side however have been growing rapidly in the last few years. owners and staff are awesome. get a membership before they start raising the prices because its too good of a gym to not increase rates.
i was really surprised by the last two bad reviews. i just got a pedicure and it was awesome. the ladies were so sweet. but the thing that impressed me the most was how clean everything was. ive literally never been to a salon that worked so hard to keep everything clean and sterile. my pedicure was great, i got the deluxe package and she massaged my legs for about 20 minutes. i was thoroughly impressed, i will definitely be going back
this place is phemominal! first of all, it is a coffee shop that serves food over lunch hours. the coffee is decent but its really the food and the service that make this place shine.all the sandwhiches on the menu are delicious and made with boar heads meat. the real gem are the russian dumplings called pelmeni. these are meat and potato dumplings with melted butter, cilantro, curry powder, and spicy sauce, eaten with sour cream on the side. if you never had them, you are missing out! i probably go here at least once a week for the dumplings. call ahead to see if they have them because they are so popular, sometimes they run out midweek. all the ingredients are also local.the owners are great and i love supporting this local buisness! they also have free wifi and a childrens play area. this place is worth the stop in.
great local coffee shop! the service is outstanding, and i love that they offer coconut milk. they have a nice area for kids to play with lots of toys and books. the food menu looks great but i havent tried any of the soups or sandwiches.
best little coffee shop in madison.  the staff is amazing, they always remember your name and what you like to order.  they have both almond milk and coconut milk which is a huge plus they also have many veggievegan options.  the pelmeni is addicting! i work across the street and it takes some serious will power to not eat here everyday.  they also have amazing sandwiches made with top notch breadmeatscheese and homemade soups.
my experience at braces etc. has been amazing. dr. dhaliwal is very experienced and friendly, and you will have the comfort of knowing you are in good hands.quality of work is great. the wait time is fast and efficient, you are in and out of the office. they are very flexible as far as appointment times. their office is beautifully decorated and very clean. i can definitely give them a 5 out of 5!!!
this place is amazing, i do my braces here and love them, the doctor is nice and kind so is the cashier.  i always enjoy coming here unlike other dental places. anyone one who wants great braces and a pretty smile needs to come to this place. this place is very clean and everyone is welcome. when they put on the braces they are very careful. i love love love love this places its they best orthodontics! they always have a great happy mood. thank you dr navpreet dhaliwal and rosie!!!! this place deserves 10 stars.
dr.dhaliwai is a very proffesional orthodontist. she is very caring to her patients and keeps the parents very imformed about all treatments and procedures done on my child. the office staff is very professional and friendly. everyone here greets you with a big smile and make you feel very welcomed. and the office always smell so great ! i would definetly reccomend  this office to anybody needing braces.
dr. dhaliwal is undeniably the best orthondontist in las vegas. a very friendly staff and calming, clean interiors make this the ideal dental office. its quality you can count on.
grrrraaaannnndddddd opening today! come on down for a free evaluation and adjustment.  give aways and specials. i love the joint because its convenient with great chiropractic care and amazing doctors.  i can always make time for an adjustment.
came for the grand opening and i was very impressed! brittani and julie were so friendly and the process very quick. will definitely be back!
wow all i have to say is the joint is the place to go the customer service is perfect and very friendly. and the work is pure they do is pure quality. im very impressed. every time i walk out of the joint my hole body feels better my pouster feels way better and my back does not hurt any more or my neck i will recommend the joint to everyone that has back pain or neck pain wow........
i have been in chiropractic for 20 years. my son and daughterinlaw3rd generation chiro are both chiropractors. i came in today for my weekly adjustment and had pain in my right muscle above the shoulder blade. dr. danny kalkantzakos worked me over good. went home and iced, of course and i was 80 better within a very short time. he took the time to do what he needed to do and i appreciate his professionalism. by tomorrow i will be free of the little pain that is left.ive been going to the joint for 2 years now and so happy they opened an office much closer to me on w. lake mead. the girls that work the front desk are always very friendly.thank you dr. danny.k.sasser
ive been going to the joint for about a year and am always amazed at the quick and wonderful treatments i receive there. since this new location has opened, ive had the privilege of seeing dr. danny a few times. i was there today and he gave me a fantastic adjustment concentrating on the hips and knees. he always gives so much of himself. and has a great sense of humor, too. high recommend.....
i have been to the joint for three times now and all i can say is i cant live without a monthly visit here. in the course of past few visits, i have had the privilege of seeing both dr. altman and dr. kalkantzakos he goes by dr. danny k. i have been having intense back pain for few months that progressively gets worse. i was having many sleepless nights but after my visit  icing my back, i was able to get full 12 hours of sleep. they do a wonderful job every visit and i cant thank them enough. 29 for a treatment but package plan is a good choice if you need a weeklymonthly visit like me. highly recommend!
this review is for dr. alexandra reimann who is the naturopathic doctor at vallhalla.  ive been seeing dr. alex for a couple of years and always appreciate my visits with her.  she never rushes you and always goes over anything that might be bothering you in detail.  i also like that she really looks at getting you to the optimal test results for your blood work, not just in range like most other doctors.the only downside is that since nevada doesnt recognize naturopaths i cant use my insurance for the visits.  so it can get a little pricey when you first start treatment but i find it well worth the cost.
i am very happy with dr. weingrow!! he is very good with his patients and encouraging of you as person and for your overall wellbeing. the office team is always wonderful, personable, and helpful to meet schedule needs or ask how you are. i enjoy seeing and dealing with the office manager teresa. she is very hands on and keeps the office flow with positive energy! must have to keep the doctor office running smooth. i will come all the way cross town anytime for them!
this place is very well decorated and is very clean. i was very satisfied with my service and the prices were very nice. it was an wonderful and relaxing time for me. i am definetly coming back!
this place is very well decorated and i have been here a couple of times now. the service is still amazing! the prices are great and i enjoyed everytime i came here. i am very relaxed when i walk out of oasis spa. this is now my favorite place to get a foot massage.
it a great place clean and quiet, when i came here the first day i enjoyed it so i came back the next day. as expected,  the massage is excellent once again. perfect place for me since i like to have my oxtail soup across the street after a nice massage. namaste! aloha!
carpets came out so clean and jason the tech was very helpful!!!
i meet the owner at a local restaurant, i was new to the area and he told me about his restaurant irie vibes jamaican cuisine. so i had to check it out, i got the curry chicken over a bed of rice and beans, and it was absolutely straight from the soul! this food was so saviour and tasty i ate every bite. i would definitely give two thumbs up to who ever has a craving for some amazing jamaican cuisine.

just got home from a great comedy show! james thayer was the headliner and was hilarious. the owner was an amazing guy and personally went around after the show and introduced himself and thanked everyone for coming. super stand up guy! if you are looking for a reasonable priced night out and want to laugh and have a great time i highly recommend!
enjoyed the show tremendously! very funny comedians, loved ta burrows! will definitely recommend to friends!
every comic was spot on. super funny and great atmosphere. drinks were resonable and food was great. highly recommend for a good time with friends.
love the show. love the comics!!!! the hospitality was awsome. we need to catch more shows from this team.
my gf and i went to see the comedy show and we really like the mc sidney and his line up was great. this is not the first time we have seen one of his shows and it wont be the last. all comics were great! check them out if your up for good night of comedy.
the two comments below are very inaccurate and should be reevaluated. with that said, this location and its staff is awesome. they were very friendly to me and my family. since the location is new, everything is clean and very presentable. i work at another chipotle store, and i like to go around giving genuine yelp ratings on other chipotle stores. its all based on their cleanliness, hospitality, and performance this chipotle store exceeded my expectations.
stopped in with my kiddo for a quick dinner after a hectic day, and had an excellent experience. the food was well prepared, fresh, and tasty! even if the food had been subpar, i would still have been satisfied. the staff went out of their way to be friendly, patient, and went above and beyond when i had a moment of crisis.food issues come and go in the fast food business, but there truly is no substitute for quality service. luckily, this chipotle location has the best of both worlds!
honestly this chipotle is just like any chipotle i have ever been to. this location has been wellkept and clean every time i have gone. the food has been great and reasonably portioned per what i have seen at other chipotles. the employees are friendly and help to move you quickly through the line. if i need chipotle, i will probably just drive the 3 minutes to this location and eat until i am stuffed full. also, i did not smell anything but tortillas and grilled chicken.
this place is amazing my husband and i just left and we had these two men and they did such a fantastic job!! will most definitely be coming back!!!!!!
i went to magic feet not expecting too much even though my bff told me it was awesome. my husband and i went for a couples reflexology massage, but when i was done i was amazed on how i was worked on head to toe. i was very happy... im planning on going again with maybe another couple, maybe the friend that told me to go!
this is so tasty!!! i had the hearty veggie with braised beef and couscous. i shared a couple of dishes with other friends too. ill have to come back for different dishes! chef craig is a johnson wales graduate and partnered with hamza, a fellow morrocan to create some delicious food. great location on central ave too!
delicious! we ordered a variety of things to try it out. it was all good, but the chicken and apricot couscous homemade!, the beef brochette, and the baklava were the highlights. very, very excited to have it in the nighborhood.
cant say enough!  stumbled across this place when the restaurant we meant to go to was closed.  it was opening night on this small, mainly take out find.  opening the door a wave of spice and aroma greeted us.  chef craig and his crew educated us about all the dishes and let us sample the most intriguing.  it was a hard choice but we finally settled on the apricot rubbed chicken, the kefta and the braised beef with hearty veggies. many dishes are served with the most flavorful couscous ive had. stop by and pick up your choice of this amazing food.
essentially just take out although there is some seating.  the falafel was really great and the lentils and couscous were pretty good too.  lots of vegan options on the menu.
its somewhere between a 4 and 5. since im sleep deprived and all hopped up on coffee, well round up for good measure to a five.i have been so excited to check this place out ever since i saw the reviews start popping up on yelp. so when my fabulous, globetrotting, six language speaking friend dianne texted that she needed to be fed, i knew this was the perfect spot to bring her. a breakdown of our order:veggie briouats im not vegetarian, but we went with these as a suggestion from the guy who took our order. he was right, you wont miss the meat with this savory filling. this is an item i will definitely order every time.kefta brochettes delicious meatballlike kabobs. it comes with a harissa yogurt dipping sauce. rubbed chicken and apricot this was diannes entree. i loved the flavors of this. definitely a big enough portion to share or divide up to make two meals. kama veggie tajine i had my heart set on the hearty veggie with chickpeas, but they were in the process of cooking a new batch and i was too hungry to wait. so, i went this route and ordered it over couscous. this is such a filling dish. i was stuffed less than half way through and enjoyed the leftovers the next day for lunch. i will be back to get the veggie and chickpeas!the couscous is really good by itself. they slow cook large batches daily. it has a a great flavor. make sure you try it on its own before mixing with your entree. i know my twitter friend katie l. is obsessed with the falafel here. i havent had a chance to try it yet. if youre not sure what to order, dont be afraid to ask questions. they are happy to help. as we were leaving, the guy ran outside to track us down because he found a keychain on the floor and thought we had left it. super nice. ajbani is located in the old second helping spot next to three amigos. it is primarily a takeout place, but they do have a few small tables inside and out. they also have a cooler with some beverages water, honest tea. kudos to the crew here for bringing an underrepresented cuisine to the queen city. this is such a great addition to plaza midwood and charlotte.
we are thrilled to have ajbani in the neighborhood now! we have tried a number of dishes already and found them all to be very tasty. the falafel sandwich was fantastic. the spicy lamb tagine was excellent. the chicken wrap with the chermoula sauce was very nice. we look forward to trying everything on the menu eventually. also, the chocolate tahini balls are absolutely delicious. ajbani is a fantastic option that has been added to pm.
i ordered the chicken and apricot  cous cous entree. very tasty! very much a takeout spot, but there were a few small tables to sit at. the food was prepared well and didnt take long at all. definitely coming back!
ajbani is a welcome addition to the diverse central avenue restaurant row. moroccan food is a favorite of mine and ajbani is an excellent spot to get authentic dishes. lamb briouats dont worry, i butchered the pronunciation were perfectly flash fried and the ground lamb was expertly seasoned. ive had hummus all over the world and ajbanis is some of the best. its dense and the garlic and herbs were balanced perfectly with the preserved peppers.  the spicy lamb tajine was delicious, and the flavors were classic moroccan, but ill be sure to ask to make it spicier next time as im a fan of the heat. the berber chicken was savory and came with a mountain of perfectly cooked couscous. dont forget to order a side of harissa, its not very spicy but its a great compliment to the flavor of the dishes.  hamza, the owner, is more than happy to help with suggestions for your order and the dude is going to see a lot of me because im going to become a regular at this joint. only a few tables are available so its probably easiest to order it to go.
wow! so glad this place came to plaza midwood, it has so many vegan options. my absolute favorite is the eggplant zaalouk appetizer, then follow it up with the kama veggie tagine. end it with the chocolate truffles. the owner, hamza was so helpful and described all the dishes in detail before making my choice. i will definitely be back!!
ajbani.moroccan food has landed in charlotte and its delicious. theres plenty of couscous for everyone. if youve never tried food from northern africa, youre in for a treat!go with a group of friends, like we did, so you can try a bunch of items!berber chicken: roasted chicken with saffron, cinnamon and garlic over couscous.falafel sandwich: actually  tender and smaller pieces  not dry at all.apricot chicken: great flavor. dry rubbed chicken served with olives, apricots and veggies. yes, your chicken was better than mine! dont rub it in.7 veggies with lentils: really nicely balanced vegetable stew with the perfect amount of heat.keftah brochettes: moroccan bbq style meatball kebabs  a nice meaty char served with harissa yogurt sauce.veggie briouats: little savory phyllo pies  you wont miss the meat!tomato and caper salad: super summer dish made with a hint of preserved lemon.eggplant zaalouk: roasted eggplant dip with garlic and tomato. the owner is very friendly and stays on top of quality control, making sure hes happy with the dishes and their appearance.there are a few tables indoors and out, but you know how that goes in charlotte. either  face the brutal heat outdoors, or the hot air wafting over from the kitchen prep area. take out is probably your best bet during the summer!
delicious.   everything we had was that good.  dont pass up the tomato and caper salad with preserved lemon or the harissa yogurt!
great food! we asked for recommendations from the owner and he was right on.  we all loved our dishes! the food came really quick which is a bonus.
outstanding! berber chicken was as delicious as it sounded on the menu. perfect blending of flavors and for dessert the tahini chocolate truffles just made me happy. you must try this place!
excellent alternative for vegetarians and vegans in charlottehttp:doinglean.blogspot.com201509ajbanimoroccancuisinereview.html
i love this place! i travelled to morocco twice and fell in love with the country. this restaurant brings back so many great memories of those trips  the sights, the sounds, the people and most importantly the flavors. ive tried a few dishes now. my favorite is probably the tagine, in particular the lamb tagine. the berber chicken is also very good. even though the entrees alone are too much food for one person a good problem to have, dont overlook the appetizers, sides and deserts. the briouats are great. the harissa hot sauce is so good with layer upon layer of flavor packed in one little cup. annnnnd, i tried the truffles tonight. oh. my. gosh. they are out of this world. seriously. ill never be able to order from ajbani again without getting the truffles. in fact, i may go back just for the truffles. a little dessert after dinner those nights we go to next door neighbor three amgios, maybe? they are this perfect mix of sweet and savory, soft and crunch. mmmm... ill be back soon and often!
had 3 dishes and all were excellent.  inventive combinations of familiar flavors from the middle east.  good veggie and meat dishes.  this is a rare find.  nothing to look at, but my favorite restaurants have usually been in sketchy neighborhoods, and bare bones cooking.  ingredients are clean and fresh, if the neighborhood isnt.  but theyre keeping it real and affordable.  seating in or out is not a good option.  take it home and enjoy it with a crowd.  each dish will feed two, easily.  if you go out to eat for the food, go here.  if you want valet parking, starched table cloths, and think thats worth it a crappy meal, there are many overpriced choices.
excellent! will definitely be back. everything was delicious. so glad to find this place!
hold up, youre saying i can drink beer, do yoga, be outside, and meet fun people? fine, twist my arm. or, ardha matsyendrasana me. yes, i had to look that up on the world wide webs. i just call it seated spine twist.anyways, back to ombs yoga on tap. the concept: an outdoor yoga class at a brewery featuring a different instructor each week. i love the idea. it connects yogis from all over charlotte. the energy from the group is pretty amazing. most important rule: get there early. class starts at 6:30pm and this thing gets packed. you want to make sure you have time to find a parking spot which can be brutal, claim some grass to put down your mat, and grab a beer if youre into that kind of thing. straws are great for easy drinking access. dont get me wrong, its a great yoga class. and, its a free class. however, its more of a social hour versus a fitness hour. come on, think about it: youve got 200 people drinking beer outdoors. people are talking around you, taking selfies, laughing not at others, at themselves, and take beer sipping breaks. its all pretty distracting, and im not even a very zen, oom kind of yogi. great line from my friend scott, its hard to get into a mindset for a spiritual place when youre overhearing someones tinder date before class.i celebrated afterwards with a hornets nest, smoked salmon pita, and a side that i ordered by saying, and this long word that i have no clue how to pronounce. for those keeping score, its bratkartoffeln and it was yummy. amidoingitright im proud to live in a city with such a vibrant and thriving yoga scene. its great to have such fun options like this here, and in such a beautiful setting. ill definitely put this into my yoga rotation. namaste.
my experience with yoga is mostly limited to this. ive taken a class or two at the y and a free trial session here or there. but i am not naturally flexible and i hate being reminded of that so i dont really want to pay for it.thankfully, yoga on tap came along offering free classes with a different instructor from an actual studio each week.omb really makes use of its spacious lawn and it keeps getting more and more crowded, which is amazing because when it first started, it was in its old location and had only enough room for about 14 of the current class size.if you are an experienced yogi, you are probably not going to like it because you dont get much individual attention and there are potential distractions galore. but if you are like me and want to use it to get a good stretch coincidently falls on a morning run day for me, increase flexibility, or enjoy a new physical activity, you should definitely check it out.being outside in the gorgeous charlotte weather, in a low key class where you are guided but free to do your own thing according to your ability, and the opportunity for a beer before or after or even during class are some great pluses to checking this out.get there between 6 and 6:15 to park and get your mat down.
i highly recommend joining this event on tuesday nights! it is always a lot of fun and the instructors they bring in are wonderful. i havent yet found a studio i am ready to commit to tight budget! and this is a great way to get a feel for a place i may enjoy most. and you cant beat the price, free!! enjoy the yoga and stay for a beer. great combination.
ok, so first off let me say that i have little experience with yoga. i grew up as a dancer, but after tearing my acl i slowed down a bit and was looking for something more soothing and relaxing to do, while still getting exercise. i have taken drop in classes around the area with friends, but i couldnt find myself gravitating to any of the studios, and anyone who has done yogadance anything involving a studio, knows how important it is to get a good vibe off of the place you go to practice. heba is amazing, let me put this in caps so people who skim reviews know that heba is amazing! my first class that i took with her was honestly an experience. she was involved and went around helping students, and even asked before class if anyone has any injuries or has any focus areas. super cool. she brings a welcoming, calm vibe to class which is nice to see as a beginner. i would 1010 recommend taking any of her classes!
so long story short, my yoga studio shut down unexpectedly and i abruptly found myself on the hunt for a new place. i tried a handful in the henderson area only to be gravely disappointed by them all. then, however, i got a message from heba  on yelp inviting me to try out her new yoga studio and i was a so impressed that she personally contacted me and b so thrilled by the timing i had just gotten home from the worst yoga class ever at one of the new studios i tried out. anyway, i show up to the intro to hibs yoga class today at 4pm and the studio was so cute and cozy, plus i was greeted by the owner herself who was just as friendly as her yelp introduction made her seem. she offers a variety of packages and classes for all skill levels and more importantly gets to know you and your intentions and makes you feel right at home right away.  the class itself was awesome. small and intimate with a great blend of strength building, meditative breathing, and flexibility. she made an intro class about much more than just basics. anyway what i am trying to say is, i am so happy i found this place or rather that it found me! and i immediately signed up for the 39.99 one month unlimited beginner package. i cant wait to go back.check it out! you will be so happy you did.
great studio, best yoga teacher. there are classes for all levels.  one on one attention is always a priority.  highly professional and relaxing atmosphere.  if you are a true yogi, this is the place to be.
i love it here! the staff is very friendly and remembers me by name. i also feel very safe while taking classes. the teachers are great at making sure you are doing the poses correctly. i highly recommend this studio!
hibs yoga is a warm  peaceful studio. i have been a student of hebas in her teacher training  in her yoga classes. she welcomes everyone... if you are a beginner or a seasoned yogi and you have not been here.... please check out some of her classes. her style is unlike any other in las vegas  it is challenging but healing. her voice alone can bring you back to the mat. heba has a true gift in guiding us to a deeper connection and understanding of yoga  being ok with where we are at. its intense but it is life changing! each class has someone there to help the teacher with assists and adjustments  there are blocks, bands, straps, blankets  mats for everyone to use...  i used to feel uncomfortable with help or assists until i realized how valuable it truly is! everyone at her studio is open, friendly and makes any one new to her studio welcome! if you are new to yoga or pilates, hibs has a variety of classes, if you want to deepen your practice  try something new... well, it is all here.
i am new to the yoga but after one class decided it was what i was looking for to help me get in shape and learn more about my strengths.  the yogis are friendly and very helpful.  the staff is fun.  heba makes it a point to know all of her guests.  she speaks to each one before class to find out intentions and if you are working with injuries.  the variety of classes and times are wonderful.   stop by and join in a class or two.

hibs holistic integration of body  soul is a warm, wonderful and safe place to come home to your yoga practice or try something new. the studio is immaculate, the staff are kind, the instruction is personal and if you need an environment free of judgment or hidden agenda in henderson, anthem or the las vegas area, this is the place to be. so many props available to aid in your postures, yummy aromatherapy to influence a deeper practice and hands on assists from generous teachers.

holy cow!! this hotel has only been open for five weeks and if you are in the charlotte nc area i would highly recommend. the lobby is beautiful and the rooms are gorgeous. the bathrooms in the rooms are so well designed and the doors are like sliding barn doors with full size mirrors. the complimentary breakfast was awesome, 24 hour coffee and hot water for hot tea and hot cocoa. we were not able to use the pool but the seating area next to it is great. seating area has an stoned outdoor gas fire place and gas grill. the entire hotel is very modern. the staff couldnt be better and always have a great smile and energetic personality. a great place to stay for the night or forever!!
i have been going to ssf for nearly 6 years!  this is a private gym with great facility and excellent trainers.  you will get the best result and stay fit all through the work out routine. they also train high school athletes for baseball and football programs. very spacious and always get to use the equipment you want, not wait and never crowded.  just a great gym with awesome people.  membership only.  they also have dietary programs with high quality supplements.  i highly recommend scottsdale school of fitness for those who want to maintain a healthy and active life!
we highly recommend scottsdale school of fitness.  its a private gym with great trainers. there is also a high school athletes program in the afternoon.  the owner rob gentile is also a coach for high school football.  the atmosphere in the gym is positive and everyone there, wants to be there.  weve been going there for over 3 years.  its never crowded and the equipment is always in good working order.  the gym is also very clean in all areas.  there is a yearly fee over and above the training fee.  its so minimal not to even be a concern but allows you to use this fabulous, clean gym to train at.  we see the same faces over and over, be it a trainer or a client.  people like this training facility and keep coming back.  there are no bells and whistles. shower facilities are available. everyone who works there likes their job and you can tell by the passion they have for their clients.  woohoo! its as good a it gets!!  scottsdale school of fitness is a hidden gem and were glad we found them.  its the best gift we give ourselves and were 67 hoping to be active well into our a lot older years!
adam dalen is my trainer going on 8 years.  adam is very personable, yet professional.  he is always ready when my 3 weekly appointments start and thankfully is always changing the workout so im not bored.  most importantly, he keeps me motivated and keeps my whining down to a minimum.
i love this place,the chicken is fall off the bone amazing,the owner is very nice and helpful so please all come support this jewel...
really good authentic mexican food. the pastor and carnitas tacos are delicious! i ordered delivery and was charged a fee for every little side so that was the only down side that made it seem pricier than other places, but it was excellent food and i would order again. also had a burrito enchilada style which was good and a large portion. pozole soup really good, lots of flavor. cucumber lime drink was sweet and refreshing.to be fair the two salsas we ordered were much more than we needed. also, we were given some ceviche for free which was fresh and delicious!
this is by far the best mexican restaurant in town!!!!! i ordered a delivery!!! yes you hurd right! to my work and then to my house for my fiance to try! by far the best chicken quesadilla we have ever had! there carne asada burritos and street tacos were also very good!!!! they do fresh juices as well! the man who takes your order and delivers is very nice!!!!! i will for sure keep ordering from this family owned restaurant!
i came to vegas for my buddies bachelor party, we got wasted the night before, no bueno lol any how i yelped near by restaurants and this little gem came up! i rarely rate restaurants but seriously everything we had was amazing!!! the chicken was moist tender and delicious, my buddy joe had a burrito with al pastor which he said was freaking delicious! i tried a  piece and yep! he was right.. the staff was really nice and welcoming which is a plus, but i care more about the food..  haha try this place you wont regret it: specially if your looking for authentic mexican food.
i came to the strip and i was craving authentic mexican food and i found this restaurant and it was really good. not only the service but the food as well. i would recommended to anyone craving mexican food while staying at vegas
i wanted mexican food so i looked up this place and saw the pictures they have so i ended up ordering wings and hamburgers for the kids, let me say that the wings were delicious and never had wings with that taste and flavor the best ever for sure. the hamburgers we got looked the same way they had in the picture and was very delicious too, will order again and again and the steak tacos were big and juicy. the service is excellent!!!
la comida muy deliciosa ! el pollo es el mas rico de las vegas. una atencion excelente y los precios razonables! cuando visite las vegas seguro vuelvo por ahi!
i freaking love this place! my second time around and again i left very happy. its one of my favorite mexican restaurants. it is very difficult to find an authentic mexican place. i am amazed in how tasty their food is. many choices , tasty food, and great prices. i am glad i made the choice to come visit again.
we got lost when we exited the freeway and thought to give this place a try before trying to find the freeway entrance. the place looked busy which is always a good sign, i ordered house special which was half a chicken with sides my wife ordered the fish, to our surprise the food wash delicious, we did wait a bit for our order to be taken but it was worth the wait. i added this place to my favorite unknown restaurants.
best wings ive had in vegas... customer service is just as good. got a great deal on here pay 15 for 30 worth of food. i always get my wings well done and they were spot on perfect.

we used them using grub hub  amazing food, service  delivery.  our order actually arrived 30 minutes before estimated delivery time.  food was hot  delicious.  my husband made sure i remembered the name, so we can order again.
the food is delicious and rami is super nice, makes you feel special! the green sause they make is probably the best green sauce in town in my opinion, full of flavor and nice and spicy!!!! love it!!!
this place has the best menudo, the service is wonderful they treat you like family. i will continue to come here. i truly recommend it to the world!! i love it!!!!!
i loved the food here. a group of friends and i came here for dinner. i had chicken, that was perfectly seasoned it was wonderful to eat a piece of meat that didnt need additional seasoning or sauce. that is so rare these days. i didnt have a chance to eat any mexican food but their case looked good. i am definitely going back.
they have really good food if i could i would order from here every single day. it reminds me of my moms cooking. i really like the carne asada fries. i recommend people to get food from here. its bomb its worth it
its amazing although they are a bit late on their delivery but when they do bring it. they always add a couple of extra items and it always makes my day . amazing mexican food by the way!
ive been looking for authentic food like this for months in vegas. located inside the marketplace. this place has everything including what everyone forgets , great hospitality. the folks that work here treat you like family. notice i havent even started talking about the food yet. i ordered takeout late friday. i called first but they didnt pick up later found out is because their busy. the owner called me back, first time ever a restaurant called me back lol. i ordered steak enchilada, carne asada fries and chicken wings. they told me exactly when to expect my order pick up and called back with update... i know crazy right. upon arriving i noticed the place had way more to offer than what you can see on yelp. the owner gave me samples of other dishes on display that had me drooling. they have an app that you can download which is best way to order with pics. hands down great place for authentic mexican food, will order again so i can try everything. not a sit down to eat place. primarily takeoutpickup and delivery.
this is a very good chinese restaurant the service is amazing and and the veggies which is one of the main reasons i go there are fresh.  they are very informative and the chai tea boba is awesome!  would recommend to anyone who likes chinese food!
im a huge fan of china one and this one tips all of them. very nice staff awesome food and is very clean! ill let be coming here more often
dh and i went there tonight.  we were blown away by the flavors, freshness and friendly service.  veggie fried rice, teriyaki chicken served over perfect veggies with great sauce, orange chicken and fried wontons.  yes, we order a lot because we are used to that american chinese food place.... but for the same price we got so much more at china one.  thanks guys!!!
i highly recommend this place. the food, service, and atmosphere are much better than your standard chinese takeout place, but the price remains quite affordable!
first time customer and was not disappointed. i have always liked china one and was happy to see that there was one closer to home. we started with the fried shrimp as an appetizer  6  in an order. it wasnt what i expected but happy to say, i was pleasantly surprised. they were tempura shrimp! sorry for the excitement, but i love tempura shrimp. entrees ordered were beef chow fun  very nice presentation and great taste. i ordered it extra saucy because thats how i like it and they did not disappoint. combination kung pao  nice presentation, fresh tasting veggies  lots of them, the shrimp really stood out to me but the whole dish was delicious. strawberry boba and thai tea boba to go. delicious! we dined in and received great service. very clean and nice atmosphere.if you live in the northwest area and are looking for quick and delicious chinese food, forget about the big black and white  bear and go up the street to china one instead.
fantastic restaurant! food was amazing, staff was super attentive and friendly, and were kid friendly too! highly recommend as the best chinese ive had in las vegas!
i like to have china one food sometimes. its more or less closer to real chinese food than lets say panda. this location is nicer for the dine it than the other location i used to go. anyway i like it.
visited restaurant on a whim and pleasantly surprised with phenomenal customer service quality of our meal portion sizes are very generous will come back with the family this restaurant though being small rivals the big chain  chinese restaurants will be coming back to enjoy delicious dinners
came here for lunch and ordered the orange chicken special off the lunch menu. the staff is super nice and the place is clean. small seating area, but still nice. they gave egg drop soul as part of the lunch special. not bad tasting at all.  my order of orange chicken was on front of me 10 minutes after i ordered!!!! how awesome is that. it was hot out of the kitchen steaming in front of me. the portions are quite generous too; another plus! after letting it cool down a little,  i tasted the goodness. it was very enjoyable. a very positive experience here
steaming hot egg drop soup, wonderful fast service!!this is a great all around place.  i have been here a few times and cant find a single flaw!  if youre feeling like chinese they have every choice you could imagine and will also do special orders. i like the black pepper chicken and ask for cashews and mushrooms and they get it perfect every time.  cant wait to come back again;
great food and they deliver!!! we got orange chicken, house rice , chow mien, spicy shrimp, egg rolls, potstickers, it was a lot of food. was fresh and delicious! we will order from there again for sure. thanks for the excellent food and very fast delivery!
first of all im obsessed with dunkin and their coffee and anybody that says different is out of their mind. but this dunkin also has paris!!! she always double checks my order and she knows exactly what i get, also shes so sweet and so funny!!! give that girl a raise!
so happy to have some good dim sum in madison!! they have an entree menu, but they also do allday dim sum. youll end up spending around 20 per person, but totally worth it. my spouse gives a big thumbs up for the pork buns. the space is huge, so i hope they can fill it and stay around! we will be regulars here for sure.
awesome delicious dim sum! no more driving to chicago for it. the bbq ducks skin was crispy and so  flavorful. theyve only been opened for a month. it was definitely worth the drive. will definitely be back!
found this place on yelp. i admittedly didnt have any high hope at first because the previous restaurants at this location werent good at all.the new owner has definitely made it right. madison was long due for a dim sum restaurant, let alone a decent one.for the background, im a huge fan of dim sum. my wife and i often drive to chinatown in chicago just for dim sum and chinese bbq. im so happy i dont have to do it anymore.the food is good. the portion is on the plus side, and the price is on the spot. dim sum is available all day including weekdays. i also tried a la carte dishes. japanese tofu in abalone sauce is recommended.i love the fresh soy milk, and they put sugar on the side for you.therere more on the menu that i want to come back for.
good traditional cantonese dim sum at a reasonable price. dont go in expecting panda express. if you have 5 or more people, the bottle of black and gold sake was also quite good.
the store is very clean and convenient! people there are very friendly and they deliver good service! :

love this store. i dont have to go all the way to the east side just to get some good filipino snacks.
after weeks of searching for a vehicle on other lots and obnoxious sale reps, we opted to go to kia henderson.  i knew exactly what i wanted.  shane was our sales rep and mark a. was our finance guy.  we were in and out within an hour and on our way home with a new vehicle. we were treated with respect and courtesy.  if you are in the market for a kia, ask for shane, he will treat you right.  thank you kia henderson.
hi,i have been doing my service on my at henderson kia for over 5 years.  ed and all of the service personal have been giving me great experiences.  i have been shopping for a new soul.  i tried  jim marsh and findlay and could not get the deal done.  a lot of back and forth with salesman and the management office.  dont they realize that everyone knows that all the salesman and managers are doing when the go in the office with my offer. all they are talking about is where they will be having lunch not the price.  stop it you looks stupid.my experience with henderson kia was much different.  great!  i visited the dealership and picked out a new blue soul.  my salesman was aaron fierro.  he took me for a ride in the new soul and appraised my trade in.  the next day i had to work so aaron and i were making the deal via instant message.  aaron gets it.  customers dont want to sit in the dealership while the salesmen and management do their dance.  aaron and i got the deal done with out actually talking.  all i had to do is go to the dealership sign a few papers with finance clean out my trade in, shake hands with aaron fierro and drive away.see it can be a good experience.  hats off to henderson kia and their staff.
you wont be disappointed with brandys expert care.  ive been going to her for over 8 years now and followed her to this new location.  amazing hair stylist and truly good person as well!
suite bella vita is truly amazing. i came from nyc which have some of the best hair salons in the world. my expectations where quite high when i moved to arizona 2 years ago. luckily, i found brandy and she is right up there with the best. she is a perfectionist and really puts her heart and effort into every cut. she is also very kind, funny, and punctual. every time i come to cut my hair, i know its going to get done perfectly!
brandy does a great job on my hair every time. she listens to my ideas and comes up with a great style for me. by the way, i change my style fairly frequently. she also has a very friendly personality.
love love this location! i went in for a brazilian, and the waxer i forget her name is amazing! made me feel extremely comfortable!! i am also pregnant so i was super sensitive but by far the best brazilian ive ever had done. will definitely be back for my brazillians as well as other services!
after moving here i have been searching for a new waxoligist for a brazilian. believe me searching for a new one is a scary thing....i have been getting waxed for nearly 10 years and i have found some nightmare places along the way...and have ran into people who dont know what the hell they are doing...where i would have done a better job myself without the training....i definitely have found my new waxing home!skyler was amazing!!!! she made me feel completely comfortable and she knows what she is doing! her casual unforced conversations make it an easy experience. she also has a great sense of humor. i had a brazilian, chin, upper lip and brows done by her and she knows her stuff!!!thank you for hiring such an amazing waxoligist! i will definitely be back for all my waxing needs!
first time to this new wax location went to summerlin location previouslyand i will be back! had a great, quick and easy appointment with london linden. hair removal was quick and efficient. i learned what anal bleaching was and one day i will convince someone else to try it and give me their opinion! until then i will keep the fur away... wax on wax off!! arigato!!!!
excellent job they do!!  very professional, courteous and quick to get my whole legs waxed. i would recommend them to other friends.
waxing sucks but we have to do what we have to do so this is a good spot to go to. staff is nice and friendly!
this place does amazing brows!!!! ive had it done twice and the shape is always perfect! they take their time and make sure theyre perfect i got the tinting done today and i am addicted staff is nice and theyre affordable for sure!
i can honestly say that no one builds a better pool or has a better reputation in the phoenix area than premier pools  spas. they genuinely put the homeowner first and foremost in all things. everyone i know has had their pool built by premier. theyre everywhere. the one in phoenix just opened under new owners and they run a really tight ship.
we have a beautiful pool with top of the line pool equipment and beautiful options in the travertine, and infloor cleaning system. we felt like the company was very eager to please us. they were a very flexible and easy company to work with. a lot of bang for our buck.
i know a lot of people who have gotten a pool from premier pools  spas in the phoenix area and they are pretty happy. the new owners, ralph and ryan, have a great team and they are very focused on providing a great experience for their customers. i have a 10 year old premier pool and it looks and functions like new. their standards for construction are high and that is what i was looking for with my investment. id highly recommend them.
premier pools helped us to create a beautiful back yard pool. we were able to remodel an older pool and outdated spa into a unique looking updated pool. we met with premier sales and service team in december for planning. they honestly wanted us to like our pool. we upgraded to a beautiful pebble tech finish, added ceramic turtles, and custom red tile around the inside of our pool. we were able to convert the nonworking spa into part of our pool. they were respectful of our budget; though we did spend over 10,000.00. the work was completed at a steady pace. the entire project was finished in about ten weeks.
wow! what a novel idea! you customize your pizza as you move down the line. your pizza is cooked in 2 12 minutes  brought to your table! they have gluten free pies  soy cheese! love that about this place, im always looking for a healthy pizza when i have that craving! the kale sauce is very flavorful, reminded of a pesto sauce.
awesome pizza place.make your own, choose your toppings. i got bbq sauce, mozerlla cheese and ricotta.  sriracha chicken and  bacon.  mushrooms, onion, roasted peppers, and black olives.pizza was amazing!  yass!  this place is brand new and fills a void where we were missing the build your own pizza shipse.place was new and clean. the employees here are helpful, friendly, and professional.i will be back for sure!
outstanding pizza and superb customer servicehighly recommend will come back again. a
super good pizza place!! wether you want to just relax and dine in and hang out with friends, which is what i did, or are in a rush and just wanna grab a quick bite to eat with your pizza made fresh right in front you in just a few minutes. custom made to your liking. you have a choice of either white, wheat, or even gluten free dough. lots of selection of sauces and toppings that not a lot of other pizza places have. i loved that they had kale pesto, which is obviously what i got, but they also had marinara, alfredo, ranch, buffalo.. and i forget if they had any other ones, they might have. for toppings, again lots of choices. from the cheeses, to meats, and veggies, a perfect amount of selection. what i got was the kale pesto sauce, with mozzarella cheese, bacon, sundried tomatoes, spinach, and garlic. the place looks nice and fresh looking too which gives the feel of fresh ingredients about to be used to make your fast but still super good pizza at a great price. i forgot to take a picture, but go in and see for yourself. its pretty good.
pizza was delicious!  fresh ingredients, great selection to choose from for your sauces and toppings,  customer service was awesome. nice decor,  great atmosphere. i found out it is locally owned which is a nice change from all the franchise pizza places, and you can taste the difference with the quality of ingredients. will definitiely return!
this place is excellent! great food and superb service. what more can you ask for! if you havent tried it yet you must! i will most definitely be returning again.
this place is great !!!!! fantastic friendly service and the pizza was delicious . bye bye dominos.
omg!!!! what a great find for the pizza lover!!!!! i cannot say enough good things about this place from the time you enter. from the service, the fun and tasteful decor the flowers on the tables with the colored water was very nice to the best tasting crust with all of the yummy choices you can make it your own personal pizza. the price for what you get is unheard of. my family and i will be back often. thank you!!!!
fantastic!  new favorite pizza place.  i have been to other fast casual pizza, but this one actually tastes great!  the house cheese had a bold flavor... not like the plastic some pizza places serve.  dough was great: crispy and chewy.  too many pizza places are either too bready or like a cracker.  this place has is right.
my fiance and i took our daughter here and we all loved it! the manager was very sweet and polite. the customer service was amazing! we cant wait to go again!
this place is great. in a very short time they have opened up and become an excellent choose your own style pizza place.it is clean, the toppings are good and the staff is awesome.i hope for many great meals from this place.
came in for lunch around 2:30. i love this place and the idea behind it! you start by choosing your type of crust, then you pick a sauce, or even two. which i absolutely loved! the thing i have always hated about ordering pizza is that if i want a bbq chicken pizza and a regular pizza, i have to get two separate pizzas, but not here.  then you add the cheeses, meats, and veggies to your likings. which is so awesome for the picky and specific eaters aka, me. : the food was great, aside from the chicken breast, which i feel could have better taste, but it wasnt worth taking a star away because the spicy chicken and service makes up for it. so the service was great, i wish i could remember the guys name who helped us, he was tall, dark, and on the thin side, but his guest service outshines everyone he was working with by far. this place is very decently priced, 30 for 3 pizzas and 2 drinks. so glad this is close to home!
really fresh and cool experience, prices are very reasonable and the staff was all very helpful and kind although sadly i cant include any names since i didnt see any name tags on. the younger african american gentleman was awesome and had amazing service! you have enough toppings and different sauces that you can make some really cool unique things i had a bbq feta chicken and pineapple pizza which was pretty good we got 3 pizzas and 2 drinks for 30 and we were stuffed and had some to take home. the sizes arent huge but they are big enough for just about anyone. only thing id like to see here is napkin dispensers on the table and a big menu showing the options behind the counter.
if youve been to pieology, then youll know the drill for the pizza kitchen: create your own personal pizza from the bottom up with the crust, to the sauce, to unlimited toppings all for an extremely reasonable set price. thats where the similarities end with pieology. the difference is exactly why i liked it better. the pizza kitchen is just on another level. when they were making my pizza, they didnt skimp on the toppings like pieology does. they didnt give me a hard time when i asked for more of the toppings like that other place did. when my pie came out with all the fixings, the crust wasnt burned like it frequently is at that other place. their pizza didnt get cold outside of 5 minutes like that other places paperthin pizza does, nor did it leave me still feeling hungry like the other place did. simply put, the pizza that i ordered was delicious and left me full and satisfied. the crust wasnt too thin and was perfect. no burned edges. all of the veggie toppings that i chose were fresh and the sauce was flavorful. the cheese wasnt stringy at all and actually stayed on the slice, unlike that other places pizza. best of all, my pie didnt get cold before i finished eating it, like the pizzas at that place in summerlin are prone to do. last but not least is the quality of service. in a word: tremendous. the girl who took my order was extremely friendly and helpful. kudos to management for hiring a staff that seems as if they truly want to make you a pizza that youll enjoy. great food, great service, and all for a great price. i cant recommend this place enough. ill be a frequent and loyal visitor to the pizza kitchen and am so glad that its closer to me than that other place.
excellent staff! i was greeted by a very charismatic employee upon entry. the interior decor is inviting with fun artwork throughout the establishment.my pizza kitchen experience began with the glutenfree dough which made for an amazing crust!  theres a handful of sauces to choose from, i chose housemade red sauce. it is delicious!  with the option of unlimited toppings, this is a pizzanistas dream come true.  my toppings went something like this... red onion, mushroom, roasted pepper, pepperoni, bacon, and avocado. yes, avocado! i was advised to take a seat and in about two minutes, my bespoke pizza was served to my table and ready to embark on my very first pizza kitchen dining experience.it was so good, i decided to order more pizza pies to take to a 4th of july party for all my friends to try. highly recommended for all you pizza enthusiasts a wide.
i went to the pizza kitchen july 5,2015.  my grandkids came with me!  we loved it!  big screen tvs, happy employees greeted us.  the pizza is very yummy.  you create your own pizza.  clean and awesome furniture.  cant wait to go again.  we love this new pizza place!!! great price too!
weve been here 3 times already! its is very nice  clean inside! trendy decor with plenty of seating. the pizza is great! we normally go to pieology which is good too, however, they have rude employees with poor costumer service skills. the pizza kitchen on the other hand has very friendly and helpful employees. makes a huge difference. their pizza crust is thin but has the perfect amount of thickness compared to pieologys super thin crust. tpk crust is the best ive ever had! we had a bbq sauce, house cheese which is 3 white cheese mix bacon, pineapple, green peppers,  corn. delicious! also made supreme pizza  the kids had pepperoni with extra cheese and it was fantastic! so much flavor. they will add as many toppings as you want. want more cheese? then say more cheese... its not that hard. another reviewer said they skimp on toppings... what? its unlimited toppings... so tell them to pile it on if you want a mother load. all for 7.99. boom. great service, great pizza, clean trendy dining... perfect for family night out! thanks tpk!!
fantastic!!!  a far superior new pizza place in the genre of build your own pizza establishments.  finally, a really great crust, with a great choice of sauces, and lots of fresh ingredients to choose from. get the house blend cheese:  a far superior blend than any other pizza i have ever tried.  they even offer my favorite and hard to find green olives!  my daughter loved her barbeque sauce pizza with chicken, and the friends thoroughly enjoyed their pesto sauce pizza.  third time there now and the experience just keeps getting better.  great staff

this is real pizza. the secret to the great flavor is that the crust is cooked with an impinger oven. hot air. no burned crust edges. the toppings are fresh the staff is helpful and energetic. the quality of toppings and cheese are good. the process is quick. the dining room is clean. it is an easy fast quality meal. plenty of space for the whole gang.
i will try again.  for some reason, yelp will not display my rave review of this place.  it is not often i find a place rave worthy, but this place was just awesome.  i was surprised by the selection of toppings including a variety of crusts, sauces, cheeses and other topping.  this place has it right.  i have now tried all the crusts and can honestly say the vegan crust is the best!  i know, you think if it is vegan it must taste like cardboard... wrong!  this crust has crunch, and a chewy bite which shocked me because it was vegan.   the bravery of choice paid off...  it was literally perfect.  the cheese, honestly, i loved their houseblend cheese so much that i have yet to deviate from it but they have four or five options on the cheese.  take the houseblend, trust me.  chewy with deep bold flavor.  yes, you read right, a cheese on pizza that you can actually taste.  so great.  they do have vegan cheese options too, which my vegan friend who hardly likes anything dining out loved it!  he was like a kid in a candy store too because they offer vegan meat options too.  he wasnt limited to just veggies.  and he like the meat options!  great place, great staff, nicely decorated, not over priced... a winner all around.  i will be back guys!  please have a pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and green olive pizza at the ready!
brand new pizza place.  excellent food, lots of choices for toppings, extremely friendly staff, great location and very reasonably priced.  my wife is vegan and im vegetarian.  i had the chance to talk to the owner and she told me they will be adding some vegan meats very soon like vegan sausage and chicken.  i cant wait to go back! highly recommend!
im not one to post often but i had no choice after coming to the pizza kitchen. food and price point are amazing! i would highly recommend trying it out!
i really enjoyed my togo pizza my husband brought home! i was so glad not to seetaste garlic powder or parmesan cheese on the crust. i first thought when looking at the pizza is that it reminds me of a pizza place in napa valley called tomatina. artistic pizza bread, fresh veggies, just enough toppings, and not a heavy topping of cheese. theres something about the red sauce that i really enjoyed. a good flavor of herbs, tanginess, slightly salty, and a hint of garlic. the crust wasnt burnt, had a nice chew to it. i didnt realize i finished the whole thing! i was so full after. next time ill have to stop and save some for later. i havent been impressed with the pizza places around the area usually we get papa murphy so im really excited to have pizza kitchen near our home. i havent been able to try pielogy because our kids wont eat pizza and driving out there doesnt make much sense if they wont even eat it. so yay to pizza kitchen! my husband and i will be coming back.
i. cannot. even. deal. this pizza place is my new fave in the neighborhood! lemme start with the good. the really really good. unlimited toppings!!!!!!! crust  traditional, wheat, and gluten free. all thin crustmeats  chicken, shiracha chicken, shiracha sausage, pepperoni, meatballs, italian sausage, etc. sauces  red sauce, white sauce, garlic spread, pesto, etc. cheese  house blend, feta, blue, ricotta, vegan cheese, too! veggies  garlic. roasted garlic. zucchini. tomatoes. cherry tomatoes. mushrooms. banana peppers. capers. pineapples. avocado. spinach. olives. etc. etc. once its popped in the oven it has a not so crusty baked crust, which i like a lot. especially since im not big in thin crust pizza. i, actually, finished my crust on these bad boys! cot  cheap! 2 custom pizza for 15! now. the bad. the wait. this place is, literally, the subway of pizzas. you choose all your toppings as you walk the line. after i ordered my pizza, my boyfriend didnt have a chance to make his order til the 3 ladies after us in line made theirs. there was a miscommunication on who helps who in the line. i guess the employee helping me had to make my bfs pizza versus my bf being next in line. but, the employee helping me wasnt able to start til he was done with mines. which makes sense. but i can see a back log of clients waiting. maybe if they had one person in each station the wait time wouldnt be as bad  someone in charge of dough and cheese, another in meats, and last in doing veggies. kinda like how subways does it. either way, this place is new and has a great chance in getting better. especially in he servicetiming of everything.
i do not review restaurants often, but this place was new, and was so great, that i had to share. i was welcomed right as i walked in, very clean, open space. they have a menu board, but it isnt really necessary. it is almost like a subway, but for pizza. i chose a wheat dough, which i came to found out, they make in house. an assortment of toppings, i couldnt believe the amount of toppings to choose from. a girl named samantha was very helpful and very cheerful, made me a great pizza! i enjoyed sitting at a table with a big flatscreen tv with football on. everyone was so friendly, and the food was so amazing, that i will surely return. i hope this was helpful!
someone recommended this place to me and im glad they did! the exceptional customer service starts the minute you walk in and are greeted. you can select your own crust, sauce, cheeses, and toppings. . . unlimited on a 10in crust for 7.99! it names pretty quickly and it tastes amazing. i have been back quite a few times and refer all my coworkers and friends to it. cant wait to take my boyfriend!
delicious!!! a must try pizza place ... great value pizza can be shared if not very hungry or is enough for one !
ive been here 3 time. excellent service and quick, delicious pizza each time. i can never decide on one kind of pizza. last time i got half double pepperoni, sausage,  black olives and half double pepperoni, jalapeno,  pineapple. all for 7.99 tax and ready in about 3 minutes. if i had to complain about anything it would be the boring, sterile decor. fyi theyve added a small selection of gelato to their menu. it looked tasty but i had groceries in the car and was getting my pizza togo. next time i eatin im trying some!
this is our go to place for lunch once a week since they opened a little over a month ago. as a group of coworkers it is often hard to decide and agree on where we want to eat everyday but we all have no problems agreeing on coming here at least once every week. i love the custom pizza choices and after going for over a month we ran into the owner a very wonderful lady who spent quite a bit of time formulating the right crusts with the right kind of oven for consistent quality and quick turn around for getting your food to the table. although the pizza is amazing they now have custom salads you can build as well as gelato ice cream. the staff has always been very friendly and the decor is very clean and well done. i would not hesitate to come here and do so on the regular because they are doing it right.
i love this place!! this place may be new but they got the right stuff!! i love everything about this place, they are the first make your own pizza place that has wings, so kudos there! their crust is so good and flavorful, i dont know what they put in their sauce but i could drink the stuff...lol i love how fresh the toppings are and that is one of the secrets to a great pizza is the freshness of the toppings. they have gelato as well to finish off your meal. the place is always clean when we go in to eat, the staff are friendly and greet you when you walk in and thank you for dinning there. i really hope this place stays around for a long time, another bonus is it takes like less than 5 mins to get your food so if you are on lunch this place is where you need to be.
first pizza place i have gone to with real vegan options! they have vegan cheese and 3 vegan meats plus a great selection of other fresh toppings. also they have wheat crust.
staff is incredibly friendly and helpful!  place is clean and food was amazing!!!  we will definitely be back!!
my husband and i love this place! great price and great healthy alternatives. we were also able to do half and half for the toppings. the veggies are fresh and it just takes a few minutes for them to cook the pizza. the wheat crust tastes awesome. if we eat in we normally get some of their gelato also. delicious!tasted their chicken wings with 3 different flavors. not the best deal since the wings dont always have much meat on them.they currently dont take any orders over the phone.this is currently our go to place for pizza!
this new kid in town is definitely a welcome addition to the southwest valley.  for only 7.99, you can custom build your own pizza.  there are three different crusts to choose from  traditional, wheat and gluten free. quite a few sauces and cheeses to pick from including their house blend cheese and a kale pesto sauce that i would have to try next time.  they have all the traditional types of meats such as meatball, italian sausage, bacon crumble and some not so traditional meats such as sweet sriracha chicken and some vegan meats too.  what i really love in their veggie section is the grilled zucchini.  once your custom pizza is made, it is flashed cooked in under 5 minutes thru a conveyor belt.  it doesnt have the crispiness of a wood fired pizza, but i like it a lot because the crust is chewy and not too crispy. their toppings are fresh and quite tasty.  i ordered their traditional crust pizza with pesto sauce.  then i loaded it with house blend cheese, italian sausage, meatball, chicken breast, ham, black olives, artichokes, grilled zucchini, mushroom, roasted garlic and spinach.  they actually put the spinach on top after cooking so the spinach doesnt get all crispy and all dried up. it was very appealing to look at and quite delicious.  the crust wasnt all dried up.  but when i got the pizza home it wasnt very hot at all.  it was actually only lukewarm.  i dont know if that was because there were too much toppings and it should have been cooked a little longer or because of the thin crust it cooled off real fast.  maybe next time i would have to eat it there instead of asking for take out.i would definitely go back and try some other combinations.  i was a little surprised that they were not busy around supper time.  but bonus for me, because i did not have to wait in any line.
loved it! im that crazy person who puts everything on a pizza. you get a great deal for what youre actually paying. the staff was awesome. they were helpful, professional, and friendlynot something you find very often anymore. we sampled the gelato and ended up getting the espresso and pistachio. the decision was difficult because all the ones we sampled were delicious. i would choose dining here again instead of ordering from most delivery places.
great pizza place with very friendly staff.reasonably priced with great toppings. also, they offer 3,4 types of dough. definitely will be visiting often!
customer service is great and pizza tastes great! honestly cant ask for more! pizza is made however you want!
new favorite lunch spot. the staff is very friendly and the wait is not long at all. i like to try different toppings on my pizza each time. they once forgot to add sundried tomatoes after my pizza was done but it was still delicious.  and its a 3 up charge for gluten free crust.
im in love!!! being from la i had a regular build your own pizza place and now i have the pizza kitchen!!! its amazing, unlimited fresh toppings, and you can also choose your dough and sauces. my favorite was the artichoke hearts on my little pizza!! yay cant wait to go again!!
great pizza, prices and super friendly staff!             had a vegan pizza and it was delicious!!!
delicious. i would get a touch less sauce and a bit more cheese next time but the crust is great and he service is spot on. two tips for the owner: teach the guys how to push the sauce out from the center of the pizza so that it is even... and i would love to see franks red hot sauce next time i come. easy fixes. good joint. try it tonight.
this place is amazing such a great idea. staff is friendly, food is unreal, gluten options and fast. been in multiple times this week highly recommend
very friendly staff. took time to explain all the options available. my husband went with the meat pizza. i had a chicken, artichoke, kalamata olive and sun dried tomato pizza with pesto sauce. it took more like 5 minutes, rather than 3, but no biggie. my only complaint is they dont serve iced tea.
this place is excellent. upon walking in, you greeted by warm and friendly staff members who make it their goal to make sure your pizza experience is one you will never forget. they have several different crossed, and several different toppings you can choose from waves just make your mouth explode from the flavors! make sure you go you will not regret it!
i love the pizza kitchen. i cant get enough of the unlimited toppings. i can put whatever i want on my pizza that is so awesome. but i cant forget the best manager there pauline. she is always so helpful and she knows her stuff. shes friendly energetic. the best worker they have there. i like selene also shes very polite and helpful. those two totally rock and they will keep me coming back. keep up the great job ladies
we went here for dinner last night. i have been a fan of custom made pizzas and i had pretty good experiences with similar places pielogy, project pie. their menu has a vast variety of options. you can choose from regular crust to whole wheat or glutenfree. you can either choose to buildyourown pizzas or you can choose from their special menu that offers ingredients that are not made available for the build your own. they had interesting choices like clams, goat cheese, hawaiian, etc. i went for one of their specials: the fig  prosciutto with goat cheese, arugula on whole wheat while my boyfriend had his custom built. both pizzas tasted amazing! the fig preserve on my pizza was sweet and tangy but it was perfectly balanced out by the saltiness of the cheese and meat. also, since i did not have much sauce on mine, the crust came out super crispy! the custom pizza had a lot of ingredients in it so the crust was not as crisp but still the flavor was excellent. i guess in cases of thin crust pizzas, less is more. i would definitely recommend this place. if youre in the mood for custom made pizzas but dont want to drive to the strip or summerlin, you have to try it out. plus, halloween city just opened up right next to them.
excellent pizza with a variety of toppings, a reasonable price, friendly staff, and a comfortable seating area make this place my favorite pizza place in the area.
vegan options galore. 3 vegan meats and cheeseso many fresh healthy choices with no limit of what you can add to your pie.fill up on the good stuff instead of bread since the crusts are thin.
been here plenty of times and got great service but most importantly great food! did i mention unlimited toppings!! good job!
i ate here for the first time last week. i absolutely loved it. being a vegan it is very hard to find places that have options for me as far as cheese and meats go. but at the pizza kitchen, they had everything that i could want. for 2 more i was able to get vegan cheese and vegan meats on my pizza and all the veggies i wanted! it was so delicious. my mother and i really enjoyed it, so much that we came back the next day to get more pizza.the pizza was fantastic! the customer service was really great as well! everyone was very helpful and had genuine conversation with us while we waited for our pizza to finish baking! it was great! i will definitely come back to the pizza kitchen and bring others! the drive is so worth it! cant wait for them to expand across the vegas valley!
love love love this place! great friendly service and quick amazing pizza! i go here on my 40 min lunch breaks all the time with more time to spare. love that you can dec out your pizza to whatever you want on it for 8!! cant go wrong. their inside decor is very neat and modern too! check this place out :
what a hidden gem. weve been wanting to try for awhile and finally had a chance. the staff is friendly and explained the ordering process. our family of three ordered our own pizzas and each got what we wanted. they have a wide variety of toppings and they are generous with their portions too. the pizzas cook quickly and they bring it to your table. it taste great and well be back for sure.
great pizza, very fresh ingredients! they also have the best gelato. so fun making your own pizza!
delicious!! unlimited toppings, anything you could think of! im in love! friendly staff and very clean store. we will be back!
tpk is the new pizza place to be at. despite the lack of originality and potential confusion with the name california pizza kitchen, anyone?, this place is my favorite custom built pizza place in vegas so far... rip custom built pizza : cons: im so short, sometimes its hard for the workers to hear me over the glass. if the worker is also short, we have a hard time hearing each other lolaside from that, its all pros for me. their workers always have upbeat or very eager to help attitudes, which goes a long way in my book. the quality of their toppings is much more consistent and flavorful than pieology. i never have to ask can you please put some more of topping? because they give a generous amount of everything you ask for. i love ordering the traditional crust with both house blend cheese and ricotta, then ill add pepperoni, regular sausage, spicy sriracha sausage, bacon, mushrooms, roasted garlic and capers. they really won me over with the capers. im sure most people get the capers for their makeyourown salads, but i love capers as an anchovies or olives saltysubstitute. seating is plentiful inside, so it would be a great place to take kids postsports practices or games. i usually come here when i dont know what i want to eat for lunch, too lazy to make dinner or just need some comfort food.
flat out amazing! hard to eat an entire pizza. but its too good to warm it up later. best place to eat in the sw for sure.
i was skeptical at first. i really only wanted a slice of pizza, but here you have to order the whole pizza. once she told me i could have white sauce, mushrooms, capers, zucchini, artichokes, and garlic on my pizza i was in. this place is pretty awesome.
went here today for the first time and i must say it was delicious and i like that the price is just right. my coworkers and i will definitely be going back!
this place is the best. better quality and selection than all competitors. it also doesnt mess around with the bs pricing structure pizza places are using.
love this place! good pizza, friendly fast service, and i love the price and concept. the parking is convenient and its easy to get in and out. ill be telling all my friends to come here!
what a great place! i will absolutely come back here soon! service dogs welcome no questions asked which is so nice to see businesses following federal law. my coworker and i shared a pizza. this place reminds me so subway for pizzas. they allow you pick your cheese, meats and toppings. great atmosphere. fresh and beth pleasures. employees where helpful and had great customer service. will be coming back soon, thank you!
super yummy pizza and the price point is perfect for all the options offered. my biggest thumbs up about this place is that you are able to create whatever pizza pie you want. my little guys loved their half cheese and half nitrate free pepperoni pizza. this mom absolutely loved their kale pesto sauce. on our next visit we will save room for their gelato ice cream. the service was quick, friendly, and efficient. will we definitely be back!!!
fast, affordable and good! one price one size. customer service always exellent from staff to owners, the mom treats my kid nice, she even gave him a toy. definitely our go to place, especially it being just a mile down our street! oh yeah they gelato!
i had the very nice lady who works here just make a pizza that she likes and it turned out amazing and she was so sweet. it is cheap too. 8 bucks for a nice sized pizza, cant beat it
another great pizza find that has mastered the art of the build your own....with a little guidance from myself of course.  the pizza kitchen is located in the southwest at hacienda and ft. apache.  this concept is my favorite since you can pick between traditional, whole wheat and gluten free crust.  also, they have several choices of cheese like mozzarella, house blend and feta to name a few.  meat choices are a plenty and so are the veggies.  for one price of 7.99 you can pick as many or as little as you like to make your piece of pizza bliss.  the pizza cooks in a conveyor style oven and your creation comes out in about 3 minutes.  we had couple of pies  the other afternoon and they were delicious.  this was our first experience and it was a positive one.  the girl behind the counter started out with a little attitude because we made a small mistake in crust choice, but she softened up after a while.  i let her slide and still gave them 5 stars on food and quality.  pizza kitchen also has gelato and build your own salads available if you wish.  i recommend stopping by pizza kitchen asap and several times a week if you are in the southwest part of las vegas.  this place is worth the trip and i hope they survive.  they are a small operation with this being there only location.  support small business when possible. enjoy!!
what a great place! i will absolutely come back here soon! service dogs welcome no questions asked which is so nice to see businesses following federal law. my coworker and i shared a pizza. this place reminds me of subway for pizzas. they allow you pick your cheese, meats and toppings. great atmosphere. fresh food! employees where helpful and had great customer service. will be coming back soon, thank you!
this place is in the shopping center next to where i live, and had a craving for pizza but every where i look they are so expensive for a small pizza so i decide to try this place and soooooo glad that i did the pizza was so good and the plus that i could put what i wanted on it was so cool and not get charged more is even better.
ingredients are fresh, pizza is flavorful, and service was friendly! lots of options for people with respected diets! they have gluten free crust, vegan cheese, veggie meat, and many regular toppings! the spicy sausage is yummy!

super stoked about the elite sneak peek at charlottes newest hang out spot.  i really didnt do my homework and was not expecting anything, but this space is great!  love the fact that they arent just a bowling alley but they are fully embracing their name as a social place.  theyve got something for everyone.yes, the bowling lanes are cool  they are also separated into two different sections so it doesnt feel like the long bowling alley type place.  awesome places to sit everywhere so good for big groups or just meeting up with a friend and meeting new friends.  several pool tables..... one down and two upstairs with the two other ping pong tables.  i liked the shelf of board games upstairs where you can see everything.  along with the awesome activities and spaces to hang out in... the food!  notyourtypical bowling alley food... but it looks like they have some unique and tasty snacks.kudos to nikki and the folks from psh for hosting this super fun event.  samplings of red oak as well as the psh signature cocktail... that went down a little too easily.  also fun was raising money for the cystic fibrosis foundation.also kudos to brittney b. for checking all of us elites and plus ones in.  a tall order since it seemed like we had a rather large crowd.  it was good to see some faces i havent seen in a while and meet some new ones.  of course poprock photography was there capturing every moment.  you rock tonya!  cant wait to spread the word on this place.  great addition to charlotte!
what a fantastic yelp elite event!! this place is so cool. from the outside, i had no idea what to expect on the inside. 12 lanes of bowling, pool tables, video games and bars....bars everywhere ok, 3 bars. the staff was friendly and attentive. the food we got to sample was really good. the fried catfish and grits were tasty. i also tried the pretzels and beer cheese which i liked. the chicken wrap was crunchy but i expected it to be a warm wrap but it was served cold. the best thing i tried was the chicken and waffles. top notch!! the vodka and sweet tea was my favorite of the drinks being served. great turn out and its always nice to catch up with my yelp friends. got in a couple games of bowling too. hats off to nikki and the staff at piedmont and of course tonya at poprock!!
every time we have family come to town, we always try to rack our brains on where to take them.....psh is definitely going to start becoming one of those places on the list! so glad to have had the opportunity to check this place out.parking isnt exactly the best, but they did a great job pointing you to the parking deck while the construction is going on. the facility is absolutely huge! multiple bowling lanes, multiple bars, corn hole, ping pong, games, comfy seating...and the list goes on! this sounds creepy but the place just smells new!  loved having red oak there as sponsors, as it is my mine and my husbands all time favorite beer!! the peach sweet tea was delish as wellthe samples of food that came out were very good and plentiful. the catfish and grits was by far a highlight!! the pretzal cheese and chicken with awesome sauce or was it amazing sauce or delicious sauce.... were also tasty!i played a couple rounds of bowling and got my butt kicked twice by the lovely nikki. i kinda forgot how much fun bowling really is.....especially in a really neat venue where the drinks and food are flowing!awesome event and so excited to come out here again. thank you to nikki for planning it. thank you so much to piedmont social house for hosting and allowing us to experience your place. and thanks alot to the sponsors for the bevies! ps eating my smores for lunch today :

an evening of bowling, billiards, and beer? what more could an adultkid ask for? i showed up to psh not completely sure of what to expect but just excited to be there because yelp, nikki, and fellow awesome yelpers. id seen some pictures of the space online beforehand but i still wasnt sure of the complete concept. consider me blown away. what a sleek, modern, cool, fun space thats been developed here. even though our event was cordoned off to the general public it still felt very much a part of the overall action at psh. getting to have our own area to bowl, shoot pool and the breeze with fellow yelpers made me and my plus one feel very vip. the food. oh my, the food was soooo delicious that i may or may not still be thinking about the chicken tenders. and the chicken and waffles. im seriously considering going back just to try more food because yum. also, the redoak guys were very cool to have a quick chat with and this typically nonbeer drinking girl really enjoyed the golden brew i got to sample. the staff. everyone from security most of whom i found out have a military background, so yall behave on your next visit!, to the servers, and manager were great, great, great. they all genuinely seemed to be having fun and wanted to make sure we were all having fun as well. nikki. what an awesomely talented and hardworking cm and leader we have in you! thank you so much for continuing to think outside the box and introduce us all to unique and fun places. shoutouts to all of the yelpers i got to see im looking at you kristy a, trey s, michelle p, lyndsay n, and kelly c!this was my favorite event to date!
well i have to say this was the best yelp event that ive been to in awhile!! great job on putting this one together nikki!! the crowd was very upbeat, the staff was above amazing!! seriously shout out to our waitress zazzy sp?? she was amazing, absolutely amazing!! there was also a greeter out front who was so super nice and friendly, really loved her as well. so many of the staff actually took the time to talk to us and see what we really thought about things and to make sure we were good to go. there was one waitress that was having trouble getting it together but she was nice and we were a big crowd so ill cut her some slack. i live in the area and work in the area so i am definitely looking forward to being a regular here!!  i had checked out the food online before coming and it looked good but i didnt have high expectations. i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. the chicken is fantastic and the awesome sauce was just that awesome!! the biggest surprise was the vegetable wrap. i didnt expect it to be good but the vegetables were grilled and seasoned just right. i foresee this becoming a staple lunch order!! ps: the smore bags were so great!! i didnt realize how awesome they were until i got home and just really wanted a treat; luckily i had one in hand :
so... i came here for the yelp elite event and this place is freaking awesome.  my mind was blown. location: its great having some where cool to hang out thats on the south side of charlotte. its trendy enough to be in noda and cool enough to be in epicenter.  but  im glad that its not.  it feels good to have something this cool in ayrsely. amenities: they have plenty of pool tables, ping pong tables, board games, arcade games, shuffleboard, foosball table, corn hole in the patio, tons of tvs, and bowling lanes.  again...how cool is this place.  food: i was able to sample some of their food. the chicken and waffles was really good. the pretzels with the beer cheese was magnificent. the chicken tenders with their spicy polynesian sauce was the perfect duo. the chicken and pimento cheese wraps and the veggie wraps was just as good. beverages: we were able to try some of their vodka drinks with sweet tea.  they were sweet but strong.  a definite crowd pleaser. service: its great to know that a place with great amenities can still provide excellent service.  all the waiters and waitress was tentative to our needs and they were really friendly.  i even found out that one of the waitress lives across the street from my neighborhood.  and the manager, todd made sure that everything was perfect. he even gave a hug to my husband and i.  im so glad that he put everything into this establishment. it shows.  its rare for me to give a perfect rating, but its a honest and accurate rating. parking: its not the best, but its free parking and ample amount.  its a busy area but i was able to find  parking. everything was perfect here. the only thing that i didnt inquire about was security.  if people gets rowdy, im not sure if they have security.   but im sure todd has that figured out already.  :
i had so much fun. absolutely great event. from the food, to drinks, to staff,  location, etc. it was amazing.  first, the psh is a pretty cool location  arcade games, pool, bowling, and your regular bar area. great staff and events team to host the elites. everyone was super attentive and friendly even with the large crowd. no one missed a step with the food or drinks. special callout of jazzy, one of the members of the events teamwaitress. she took care of my husband and i. great service, made sure we got food when empty and ensuring my drink was full was the best.second the food! from the mini pretzel dogs to the chicken and waffles back to the pretzel dogs. we had three great choices and all were amazing except maybe the chicken pimento wraps. that one wasnt my fave but im sure its a crowd who loves pimento cheese. plus their regular menu looks great.now the drinks get their own description.  the free beer from local red oak brewery out of greensboro was a nice touch. i love supporting local and free stuff! we got to keep the beer glasses!  now the drink from psh, i sampled everything. the peach and citrus vodka drinks. both equally great concepts, interesting names which ive forgotten now. the citrus was way stronger and normally i like that but the bite was really strong. now the peach drink was amazing and dangerous.  a few of those could sneak up on it because it went down so smoooth. on to the drink i purchased  the allie berry!  its a twist on a mojito  marini. first, it originally starts in a martini glass, but i happen to spill those easily so i asked for another glass.  jazzy took care of me by putting it in a classic milk bottle. so cute and very trendy. i was later told at least 5 more orders after my initial one,  plus each one in a bottle. i think i deserved a free one or at least name credit of the j berry. : but ill settle for another drink for now. they were awesome.  lastly, the people.  it was a great event with elites. i met some new people which great.  plus it was 1 event, so my hubby and i got a different date night. i love 1 events.  keep them coming, especially 1 events!
my first yelp elite event and it was amazing! the way to my heart has always been free food and alcohol but i was impressed with the quality and quantity of food and beverage provided. perhaps i lucked out sitting with my friend and fellow eliter who had commandeered a table that happened to be right next to the kitchen. due to her strategic thinking or was it just good luck? i was able to sample one of everything that came around. list of samples in order of need to eat again to probably would not order on my own:fried chicken with awesome sauce  i will definitely return for this! it truly phenomenal. the chicken was juicy and the batter full of flavor. the awesome sauce was just that  a bit spicy and tangy but dissipates before your next bite so you can enjoy it all over again! i did not grab any but my 1 let me have a bite of the fried chicken in another, white sauce. also good! pretzel bites  the smoked beer cheese they brought around with these was great! it was an elevated take on typical beer cheese. a little smoky and lighter than the normal fare. chicken wrap  there is theme developing where anything with their fried chicken in it is good by me. veggie wrap  this isnt normally my thing. they grilled the veggies before the wrap and the sauce was full of flavor. catfish  sorry folks. i grew up eating fresh fried catfish and this just didnt have the wow factor. thank you to nikki for organizing such a great event! we will definitely be back to psh soon.
my review is late because i almost immediately left town for the weekend.but, i had a blast! what a great location for an event. piedmont social house just opened but i can already see that it is going to be the place to be.the food samples we got showed that it is more than just average bar food, and while i didnt get to see a full menu, i can tell based on the samples that the rest of the menu is going to be pretty tasty too.i wish i had the chance to bowl but because i had to leave early, decided to not jump into a game. but their set up looked incredible and the seating super comfortable.this will be a great place to go with a group of friends.even though i didnt go bowling, i did take advantage of their pool tables, ping pong tables and foosball.and excelent evening with great sponsors and a fun raffle for a good cause.everything added up to another great elite event.
im moving on up, to a deluxe apartment in the sky  george jeffersonwhen you enter a yelp event, and they direct you to the vip area, you know youre in for a treat. if weezy could only see me now!as you know this event took place in the pristine, brand spankin new piedmont social house. ooohh so shiny! can i touch it? freshly waxed beautiful bowling lanes if it were possible i would hug you, giant screen tvs and you can smell the soft green felt from the pool tables. upstairs laid back lounge and arcade games!the red oak, helles and hummingbird were flowing into glasses we could keep! the psh ice picks kicked butt!waiters glided through the crowds of hungry yelpers with trays of heavy bar food  the catfish with grits and chicken and waffles were my favorites!winning an igloo party cooler!  charlie sheenjust when you thought it was over, trays of lemon drop shots started hovering around. what you talkin bout willis?!  arnold drummond  he was talkin bout trays of lemon drops, thats what...many thanks to psh, red oak, nikki and tonya aka han solo for giving elites the royal treatment! psh is a sleek and fun social machine!!
been awhile since i had the opportunity to attend an elite event, and this was a great one to get back on the wagon with! i definitely tend to get the most hyped over new business events like this, and much like any other yelp event, this one did not disappoint!piedmont social house, or psh, definitely proved to be one of the more unique and fresher hangout joints around the area. pretty much a playground for adults, its like a db done up with less kid attractions, much better food  drink, better service, and a great modern atmosphere. great for nightlife. a must for people in this area, and definitely worth a try for those a bit further out.our event here at psh had a lot of highlights. we had access to all gaming areas. i mainly got to check out the pool tables and ping pong tables, but definitely want to come back for their bowling at some point. we were served a handful of tapas style items off their menu which all fantastic and exceeded my expectations. enjoyed the pretzels and beer cheese. we were served house mixed drinks that were also pretty good. not a huge fan of sweet drinks, but i did enjoy the peach tea and vodka drink. not too shabby. of course my drink of choice was the free samples provided by red oak. two different styles on hand, both pretty good. we had a raffle for the donations given for the cystic fibrosis foundation. didnt win anything but it was good to help out in donation. was able to get in a few words in with the manager, todd, and thought he seemed like a pretty straight shooter. seems to generally care about his customers experience here. always a plus.great event put on by nikki, and great pics taken by poprock! looking forward to getting back to psh soon!
yes, i did eat my smores for breakfast the next day...piedmont social house is like a 21 big kids dream. from the bowling alleys to the teenage mutant ninja turtles arcade game, this place is awesome! john h is right, there is plenty of seating, so no one really feels excluded. the whole atmosphere is welcoming with a fun vibe. upstairs would be nice to hang out, play games, etc. it was just really warm  i wouldnt have lasted long without breaking a sweat  over pac man and the warm room temp.red oak was lovely with their delicious beer  i really liked the hummingbird, and their take home pint glasses. the food was delicious, i was genuinely surprised with how delicious the chicken tenders were. the staff was super friendly and helpful too, checking on us for waters, and trying to make food rounds up to the bowling teams. the bowling alleys are much for fun than i expected, im not very good, but who doesnt love a bowling selfie and being able to customize your score screen?! thank you to nikki for putting this together and for the delicious smores treats, red oak and psh for this lovely event. and for the always fantastic tonya with poprock, these pictures were great! and congrats again to ronnie and michelle!! woo wooooo!
im a little late getting this one in, but this event was a blast!  psh is a great place to gather with a group, large or small.  endless activities and betterthanbar food to boot.  the staff members working the event were extremely pleasant and eager to please.  red oak, based out of whitsett, nc, poured the beers and psh supplied spiked flavored teas.  catfish  grits?  im in!  wraps, chicken tenders, and more!  and what was that lime hot sauce?!?!  oh my!several door prizes were awarded.  tonya from poprock was on sight to document all of the winners smiling faces.  everyone went home with a special smores kit put together but the one and only nikki.  that was possibly the best part.  my inner fat kid was happy!all in all, another yelp win.  i dont know that i ever wouldve visited psh on my own, so yelp served its purpose by exposing me to a place in a way that would make me consider said place as an option for future gatherings, whereas i otherwise may not have.
you had me at bowling. any time there is an event with bowling i will be there. i jumped on the chance to join in on the festivities after looking at pshs website and seeing all the fun there was to be had. i had hoped that there would be chicken and waffles because i saw it on their menu, and i was not disappointed. my 1 and i arrived, socks in hand, ready to bowl and grabbed a lane on the far right. i had one goal, and that was to bowl on these new awesome lanes with unused shoes. there are so many things to do i had to keep on track and not get distracted by the huge bar, pool tables, and shuffle board. there are 12 lanes total split up into 2 areas. one is in the front when you walk in and another is closer to the back where there are 2 pool tables, foosball, couches, and tvs. this place is huge. dont forget theres also an upstairs with mortal kombat 2, nba on nbc, ninja turtles, 2 ping pong tables, another pool table. the bowling was pretty awesome. its super interactive were you can link to facebook and add your picture to your name. you can also do a group selfie that will post as the background. keep in mind the shoes are new, i got blisters, but id rather have blisters than foot fungus. the wait staff was also awesome, making sure they visited us that were bowling with trays of their famous chicken, and sauces. i got to try the chicken and waffles and it was amazing. thanks to jennifer who grabbed one and split it with me. i also got to try red oak for the first time, and their beers are very good. the two guys who were serving it made it funny and informative. thanks nikki for a great time! and thank you to the staff at psh!
i swear that i had written a review about this right after the event. terrible yelper right here : this was one of my favorite elite events ive attended. i was super excited when nikki announced that our event was here, because i live a mile down the road and had been anticipating its opening. what better way to try out a new establishment than with a yelp event?! they had beer and cocktail drinks flowing all nighttttt well, for 2 or 3 hours and the food was literally never ending. the red oak beer that helped sponsor the event was delicious as always. psh is known for their freshly handbreaded chicken strips ... and these did not disappoint one bit. super tender, moist  juice. pair this with a quarter waffle and i was literally in heaven. they top said chicken  waffles with a honeymustardsyrup glaze drizzle and boom, magic happens. other deductibles were a variety of wraps as well as some stellar catfish and grits. after chowing down, they opened up the absolute stateoftheart bowling lanes for us yelpers, as well as the pool tables. there is an entire upstairs area stacked with old school arcade games, ping pong tables, and various board games to hang out with a group of friends.the night ended with a round of lemondrop shots and i think everyone here was sold on how awesome this place is!
i know there are a million nail places a lot are good a lot are bad. this is one that j opened, there is a very small staff but both are very very good.  i followed the owner susan from another location and she has the determination to do it as an owner. i hate to wait and never have to if i have an apt i am not told to wait because of a walk in that irritates me so much!! but they take walk ins and it is a relaxing beautiful, clean and new place so convenient to many places in henderson.  i wish her lots of luck in her new venture.,
i absolutely love this place! clean, professional but what i absolutely love is that they take the time. im truly a satisfied customer and most definitely will be coming back i do recommend
wife enjoys this new shop.  susan is her favorite and i enjoy the pedicures.  we both enjoy how they make you feel so welcomed.  we have notice even though they are still doing some decor work the place is very clean.  we would recommend them to our friends.  we chose this place since it was closer to our home and they are priced right and give great service.
hands down the best nail shop ive been to since moving to vegas. im very choosy about my nails and feet and they were good.
loved my nails! susan took her time  i ended up with the halloween nails i wanted. loved the massage chairs as well. i will definitely make this my regular nail salon!
ive been to a lot of nail salons over the years and this one is by far my favorite. not only are they friendly and easy to work with, they do a great job. my nails have never looked better and ive never had a problem with the color peeling or chipping. thank you for always doing such professional work. ill never go anywhere else!!
i love this place  ive been to alot of nail salons but this is the best... i like that they take the time they do such a great job definetely i will be coming again..
great experience with a super cool piece of tooth bling! melissa is great at what she does and makes it painless and quick! go on and get you some!
absolutely go see melissa for your tooth charm! my perfect tooth fairy talked me thru the entire process which only took 10minutes max. she is fun and personable and i felt completely comfortable with her. great price for someone making you feel like a million dollars. ill probably be back for more bling!
i love going to melissa to get my hair done so of course when she told me about her new business west coast tooth charms i had to support her and get one done for myself ! i absolutely love it , it took about 10 minutes and it was absolutely painless! she told me everything she was doing while it was happening and it turned out great ! its the perfect amount of sparkle without being to over the top.if youre thinking about getting one than i say go for it !
these are too cute!! i went in for one and ended up going back for a second one.  perfect placement.  super clean shop.  couldnt be happier, thanks guys!
forget big box coffee chains and go to provision!  excellent service and relaxed atmosphere.  you must try their oneofakind nitro cold brew iced coffee with a little carbonation served from a keg.  coffee matters people...get out of the house and try this spot today.
ah i love this place! so far ive only had coffe, no food or anything  yet. but it is so fresh and delicious and the staff doesnt make you feel all rushed. i went on the weekend and the line went fast and it wasnt too crowded. i dont know that its quick enough to go before work or anything but a nice treat for sure.
the coffee is amazing! it is fresh doesnt have that bitter aftertaste. i will definitely be coming back!
the plumber arrived within the time frame as expected to our house. dani was professional, courteous  knowlegable. he explained what he was doing as he went along. he was also personable  made a nervous customer become calm.... we give dani an a for all he did for our houses plumb problems.
amazing service, super fair prices. tnx dani.recommended, recommended, recommended!!!
great food, great wine selection, this new location is so nice and very well kept as far as cleanliness goes. i will definitely be coming back here to watch all my football games! the staff is also very friendly.
such a great restaurant! the new location on camelback just opened  the inside is so nice! loved the pizza and the macaroni cheese. great customer service.
great food, service and loved the decor of this location! the prices are going to hurt postinos. you can get comparable food for a fraction of the cost, you just have to order at the counter. i had soup and bruschetta and everything was delicious. the white bean soup was super  flavorful and fresh, not out of a can! bruschetta had a generous amount of mozzarella along with sweet tomatoes, basil and balsamic drizzle.
i cant get enough of this place.  we go here a couple times a week.  i like the sausage and onion pizza and we also get a salad.  there are three salads i really like: feta and turkey, the apple one, and the caprese.  my husband and i share a pizza and a salad.  there is more than enough food for each of us and the food is pretty inexpensive.  staff is friendly, although you order at a counter and someone brings out your food.  aside from that you dont have much interaction with a waiter as you would at a traditional sit down restaurant.
if you need some pickmeup, this is the place to go. they have an expressocentric coffee drink call liquid breaking bad lbb that is like total rocket fuel. if you add half  half to it, they call it a walter white. let me tell you, this is the best tasting coffee i have ever had. the owners are really nice too. you can buy fresh roasted coffee beans here as well. i brought some ethiopian beans home and my family said it was the best coffee they have had in a long time. my new favorite hangout. coffee
awesome place! they get their fair trade coffee from around the world and roast it themselves.  great espresso and free wifi.
a hidden gem for anyone who loves good coffee and enjoys the warm and friendly atmosphere of a local coffee shop that takes pride in what they do.  they roast their own coffee and the owners definitely know their coffee.  when we entered we were greeted with smiles by the owners who took their time to tell us about the different coffee beans and blends.  if you like a little adventure have them choose a drink for you.
there isnt a coffee shop in the world that can compare to this one! i have been a coffee fanatic for years and i have never been able to find coffee as good as this anywhere!! pam and joe are amazing people! you feel right at home with them and their coffee is to die for! have their pour over or their espressos and you will not be disappointed! love the place and would recommend to anybody!
amazing coffee and amazing company. great service and it feels like home. im here almost everyday!! pam and joe treat their customers like family! theres no other coffee place that can compare
i frequent high quality coffee shops around vegas, and i must admit, we have quite a few. now is the time to be a coffee lover in this town. just in the area around desert wind, there are at least four phenomenal coffee stops. desert wind, however, is not another flavor of the month shop. customers can see that this shop is here to stay. they have their roaster prominently displayed in the front. they care about the freshness of their coffee, hence, they roast coffee at 5 lbs. at a time. it guarantees that there will be no excess inventory that will turn stale.     they have the standard frappes, coffee, and their own concoctions. i tried the guatemalan and red velvet: both were delicious. the owners pam and joe might be the highlight of my visit. they are both extremely friendly, and knowledgeable of their product. joe spent, at least, twenty minutes with me talking about coffee, which i enjoyed. he tried to make me try some rocket fuel espresso for free. i kindly declined because i had no plans in staying awake for the next three days. i am already making my plans to come back. nothing is better than great coffee and great conversations. this place provides both.
ill keep it simple.  the best cups of coffee ive ever had, have been from desert wind.  the liquid breaking bad over ice is nothing short of spectacular, as are all of his traditional cups.  highly highly recommend!!!!
i got velvet frappe made with soy milk by request. its so yummy. stop by and get your cup of java, forget about the line at starbucks. must try!
i love this place!! owners are very sweet and loving people! coffee is excellent very fresh and tasty! i highly recommend it!
best espresso i have had in las vegas thus far! my sister dragged me here when all i wanted to do was stay in from the heat, but the trip was so worth it! joe and pam are so friendly and knowledgeable. i also love that they roast their beans inhouse. from visiting countless coffee shops, i usually judge by one of three items: espresso, cold brew or iced coffee if not available, or house brew. i needed a quick jolt and ordered a doppio over ice. the coffee had an amazing depth and bitterness that was absolutely amazing! i would definitely suggest visiting!
makes the extraordinary coffee! brilliant customer service. pam  joe always welcome new customers with open arms ready to make the best cups of coffee that youll ever taste. enjoy your coffee while you can because youll never want it to end. thank you for the hospitality and love pam  joe!
yes!!!! finally a serious coffee shop in vegas that also happens to be reasonably priced! they roast their own beans and really appreciate the art of coffee making. i didnt try the espresso yet, just their regular coffee of the day, which was a house blend. it was perfectly balanced and super fresh. the owners were super friendly and def know their coffee. it was a bit hard to find, its located in the little shopping center behind arts auto shop at the intersection of buffalo and sahara. if your serious about your coffee this is your place!
enjoy coming here, i even stopped going to starbucks because pam  joe are geniuses and bring back the traditional ways of making coffee that will make your taste buds addicted for it.they even experiment with some blends that match your personality. its like watching scientists at work thank for the outstanding service and education on the art of coffee pam  joe!
great customer service and knowledge. we just picked up a fresh roasted and ground bag of the house blend...... omg good.
i have found heaven on earth. and its near my house. check out this hidden gem on buffalo and sahara!! they fresh roast their beans in small batches! in this pic you can see the beans they use in shop, the jars of their roasts. their house coffee is a smooth mix of ethiopian and brazillian.  they are friendly, knowledgable and passionate about their product.  this is a one of a kind shop that you need in your life. seriously do yourself a favor and stop by this place!!
place is awesome. coffee is spectacular and service is equal. support local business and check this place out i highly recommend it.
just bought a liquid breaking bad from this place and it is strong and amazing. the atmosphere is nice and the lady who made my coffee and checked me out was very pleasant and welcoming.
desert wind is an absolute treasure! were in vegas on vacation and wanted coffee that wasnt starbucks. desert wind was nearby so we gave it a shot. i ordered the liquid breaking bad and it was delicious! very strong but not at all bitter or sour or ashy like starbucks. they offer soy milk and have some sugarfree syrups. pretty much anything you would order elsewhere can be made here as well. just ask if you dont see your usual on the menu. pam, the owner, is happy to make your drink your way.i had mentioned how well balanced the espresso tasted and then we started picking out a pound of coffee. joseph struck up a conversation and we started talking about coffee. this man knows pretty much all there is to know about beans! he even treated me to a shot of espresso the way he likes it, which was delicious. the espresso has serious crema and tastes so clean and fresh. he then gave me a taster of the burundi, which was out of this world! its so sweet and bright and will be a great way to start out my mornings. we got a pound of burundi and a pound of espresso blend to take home. if you buy beans and arent going to use them right away, theyre happy to seal the bag with nitrogen to keep it fresh for you. you definitely dont get this service at the chain shops. a pound of coffee was 14 and some change, which is an absolute steal for how fresh and unique their beans are. this is a legit coffee house. in fact, their coffee shipments are on display underneath the menu. they only roast 5lbs at a time so youre getting fresh espresso  not something thats been open and growing stale for who knows how long.pam and joseph are an absolute delight. i had a great time drinking the best coffee and learning at the same time. if youve tried the big chains and think you dont like coffee, give desert wind coffee roasters a try. you might actually change your mind!
really good, quality coffee place.  a little hidden but definitely worth the trip.  great selection of whole bean and hityouinface espresso drinks.  customer service is also outstanding.   love supporting small business like this that turn out an amazing, fresh product.  i recommend the walter white!
so great! brand new and the owner is incredibly kind. yummy drinks and friendly staff.
this is it folks! ring the bell, because the espresso at desert wind will knock...you...out.  wow!!!  by far, this is the best ive ever tasted, and ive tasted my fair share of coffee over the years. ive already had three shots  a ristretto and the burundi blend, so im pretty ampd up writing this review but believe me its not the coffee doing the talking; okay maybe it is. the prices are more than reasonable for the quality emphasis that youre getting, the atmosphere is very cozy and the owners are beyond friendly. if you want to learn about coffee but feel intimidated asking questions at other locations, fret not; you wont find condescending baristas here who insist on writing your name on a cup. the location is tucked away in a shopping center on buffalo and sahara, so be on the lookout when you pull in. you wont be disappointed. :
amazing!!!!! ellis gateway is to die for!!! got it over iced and i loving it!!! mocha breve is on point!  the owners are beyond nice!  what a hidden gem in vegas!! me and my husband have been trying to find a good coffee spot.. and this is it!!
taking the last sip of my iced vanilla latte was like reading the last page of an amazing book that i didnt want to end. the employees exude pride for what theyre serving. they radiate confidence in their products and it shows. the attention to detail in their decor, signage and retail is also i believe a reflection in the actual coffee quality itself. bravo to a new hidden gem of a coffee house where you would least expect it. behind arts auto body and next to eldorado cleaners.
very nice relaxing setting...very clean...pam was a pleasure to talk too...anyone on west sahara  buffalo needn a coffee fix should hit this place...two huge thumbs up!
i wasnt sure at first. i saw the sign that said fresh roasted coffee as i drove to work going north on buffalo just past sahara. i wondered if someone was teasing me with one of my most beloved vices.i finally gave in, and made way to the small shop tucked in the back corner of a row of offices. i worried that it might be closed, but it turned out that i just lucked into a nonbusy time.i ordered an iced latte, my goto test of any coffee shop. i was pleasantly surprised by the strength of the flavor, the depth of the roast, and the lack of burned bitter notes that you get from starbucks. hoping that wasnt an anomoly, i went back and tried the mocha breve, and now im a true convert.i now submit this review with a heavy heart  i want this delightful place to succeed, but i dont want to wait too long in line for my next fix.
this place is very nice and the owners are superb! i ordered a organic matcha green tea, excellent price and awesome tea. its a small shop owner by locals. their product is fresh. a precious find. ill be returning to try their expresso.
this place was amazing. i will be going back every day that i can. my large iced coffee was at least half the price of starbucks and the flavor was 100x better. very friendly staff who obviously care a lot about their work.
stopped in here today after hearing about it on yelp since theyve only been open 3 months.  small space but very personable people who you can tell love what they are doing. if you want to know more about coffee, then this is the place to ask!  i got an iced coffee and they had two brews; one for if you drink it black and one for if you like cream and sugar.  i also picked up a fantastic nicaraguan bean that i had to try as soon as i got home.  i cant wait to crack open the brazilian one i also bought.  yep, i can see this being my new goto place to pick up my beans and some good coffee as well.
this is a hidden gem! the owners joseph and pam are so welcoming and friendly. i tried the nutella latte which was the best ive had in the valley. my mother in law had a mocha, which she told me the next day that she really love the coffee aroma and taste. she said it wasnt overwhelmingly sweet since she is boarder line diabetic and trying to cut down on a lot of sugar. they do a stamp card system when you buy 10 coffee, you get one free. i would suggest calling in if your planning on buying more than one coffee since there is only one barista.
what a little gem!  nicely decorated, great service and a nutella latte that trumps samba lattes!  wish i lived closer.
hard to find good coffee in vegas  and i mean real coffee, not mocha caramel two pump extra whip frappacrap. this is most certainly one of the few places ive found. excellent coffee selection from many different regions, and the ability to have it brewed several different ways. lastly, the only thing better than the coffee was the warm welcome, which included a polite handshake introduction from the owner.
the coffee is so great alexa and pam are so friendly and very professional at what they do thanks to both of you.
this is the bomb!!! i really love how joe roast coffee beans unlike the other local roasters!!! he knows what hes doing! also pam is always welcomes you with her charming smile : alexa is a fine barista! im always happy to see them whenever i go there! literally i go there everyday, mon through sat!!! make sure to get their stamp card : you get one stamp for each drink. when you get 10 stamps, you get your favorite drink for free :
joseph and pam are so welcoming!!thanks for making me feel so comfortable while working on my studies. amazing coffee from amazing people! this place is a must for coffee lovers; moreover, local roasters. thanks for your hospitality!
iced cookies and cream with two shots....my first time here and it definitely wont be the last. such excellent coffee and friendly owner.
this cafe is very cute, it reminds me so much of cafe legato in san jose, ca. while i think cafe legato is more of a nice local momsandpops with a variety of pastries, desert wind offers a few more chic factors and awesome coffee... did i mention they have great coffee. by far, desert wind wins hands down. from walking into desert wind, you get the sense of walking into a hardcore coffee shop, they roast they own coffee in house. yes it is in the house unlike most of the place where you find the machine as part of the decor, this machine is working producing the coffee we drink. just like any coffee shops they do have daily flavors but they do have a variety to choose from. you probably read other reviews and get well acquainted with the owners joseph and pam. i am just here to confirm that it is true, they are the nicest coffeeshop owners. the way they get personal but not intruding with customers reminds me so much of arts of flavors in las vegas, nevada. this is my first and surely not last time here and they make me feel like they know me before. joseph even remembers name of my fiance classmate who went there the day before and introduced us to the cafe. right as i am writing this review, joseph is explaining to an 8 year old girl what different types and brands of coffee he has just because she asks, and he does not just answer to brush her off so cute!. you dont have to be a coffee addict like me to come here, they also have an instruction sheet on paper and on a blackchalk board to explain to you what youre probably want to order. were in 2015, everyone seems to go for the rustic ambiance but this cafe is doing it so natural and make so much sense that you dont have a feeling they are after the trend. if youre into proverbs they have a lot on the walls and i have a few favorites but you have to come to check out and pick yours.half way through my first cup of coffee, i will end this review with1 last note, make sure you get the stamp card, cause youre gonna need it. one of my favorite proverbs there says life begins after coffee, i have to stop and start some work now.
one of the best coffee places in vegas! super elegant interior. i got a cafe latte my first time there, and i loved it so much. the lady was so sweet, she even gave me a cookie! its only five minutes away from the starbucks on sahara, and seriously go here instead. i just wish they were open later than 5pm.
stopped in with my 4yearold for a couple of hours. decor in the shop is adorable and super comfy. he enjoyed his hot chocolate and i loved the nicaraguan coffee that i tried first time. pricing was super reasonable, music was good, the staff was really friendly, and i was able to use their wifi to get some work done. all in all, a really cute little place with good coffee!
excellent coffee and the cutest code shop. definitely worth diving over from the strip. you wont regret it!
excellent coffee. they roast their own in front of you. very comforting surroundings and fun things to read and look at.
i signed up for yelp just to give this place an excellent review. pam, joseph and alexa really make an effort to get to know their customers on a firstname basis. they keep my punch cards on file  one for the whole beans i buy and one for my drinks. while i like the occasional latte, im really just a house blend kind of girl, and i love the lighter blends at this place. whether im making my own at home with their beans or getting a cup on my way to work, i look forward to it everyday!
this place is a gem, albeit a little hard to find look for the sign, on buffalo, just off ne cornerof sahara. they have roasting down to a science, the owner is an engineer and it comesthru in the flavor. i honestly have never tasted a proper cup of coffee till i came here, and, idrink a lot of coffee.
really good, quality coffee place.  a little hidden but definitely worth the trip.  great selection of whole bean and hityouinface espresso drinks.  customer service is also outstanding.   love supporting small business like this that turn out an amazing, fresh product.  i recommend the walter white!
the cafe is cute, i love when they roast their own espresso you can always taste the difference and the staff is so knowledgeable and friendly. the espresso is very good, a little in the sweet side.
its not often i say anything is the best. but this is the best coffee ive ever had anywhere. its my good fortune that joe and pam opened their business nearby, and they couldnt be nicer people. joe is a coffee expert and is always getting in new beans and coming up with new concoctions. the giant roaster is a cool sight as well. the only problem is once you get coffee here you wont be able to drink the chain coffees again, but trust me thats a good thing.
this place is such a gem in las vegas! i came here because of the yelp reviews and i wasnt disappointed. they roast the beans on site and you can buy them by the 12 lb, 12 oz or 1lb. their lattes are amazing and they really take their time to make the drink to your preference. theres a vibe like youre walking into a home because its so inviting. the owner, joseph, made it a point to introduce himself and tell me about the business. ill definitely be back for my coffee needs!
skip the starbucks and every other coffee shop in town and head to desert wind coffee roasters for a truly sublime coffee experience. if you truly enjoy great coffee and a friendly and engaging experience from the patrons, this is your place. i visited this place 5 months ago and when i returned joseph remembered my name and they we were from san diego.  he then introduced us to a new creation, the walter white. a must try... one word... sublime.
my husband and i were on a hunt to find a good local coffee roaster. we drove across town after seeing the yelp reviews and it was well worth it. pam and joseph were so welcoming and full of knowledge. great customer service and quality coffee! we will definately go back for more.
best cup of coffee ive ever had. small cozy spot. friendly neighborhood spot. give them your business
saw this coffee shop when it was featured on yelp. after a short drive we found it tucked away on the northeast corner of buffalo  sahara. we were introduce to pam and a great tasting cafe latte. the roast was perfect, very smooth and not at all bitter. so if youre searching for a excellent cup of coffee made by people to take pride in their craft, look no further than desert wind coffee roasters. they put the big guys to shame.
seriously amazing. got the walter white and was not disappointed. will definitely be back!!
ive been getting eye lash extensions for years and the best sets of lashes so far were done by alesha.  she does an amazing job and pays attention to detail. i can ask questions about anything lash related and she does not make me feel dumb even if it was an obvious questions.  you can tell she is passionate about her work and each lash she attaches has to be perfect.  thanks for my gorgeous lashes.  cant wait to see you soon!
id never had eyelash extensions before and had my very first set done by alesha. she did an amazing job and they came out perfect and just the way i asked for!! she made me feel extremely comfortable and let me know exactly what she was doing as she did them! very professional and knowledgeable. great work! cant wait to come back for my next set!
i had my eyelashes done by alesha, and i have to say she is wonderful! she does an amazing job! i would recommend her to anyone in a heartbeat!
alesha did my lashes today and they look fabulous! i even had an issue where i had a small gap in my lashes and she spent extra time and care to make sure that was filled in. the salon is conveniently located, lots of parking even for old town. the inside was clean and cozy. cant wait to head back to this salon!

i saw jessica at the lash  sugar company and wow! i have had regular sets of lashes in the past, but jessica recommended i try the volume lashes and im so happy she did. my lashes are so voluminous, fluffy, full, and beautiful! jessica was really meticulous as she explained to me the technique of the volume lashes. the location is new and gorgeous and the process was relaxing. i highly recommend the lash  sugar company and volume lashes. get in there, ladies!!
i saw jessica for my first set of lashes in gilbert and have followed her to the new scottsdale location.  she is absolutely amazing and does a wonderful job.  my lashes have never looked better.  dont go anywhere else.  if you want your lashes done right by experienced professionals with quality products, the lash and sugar company is the place to go.  i also tried sugaring today for the first time.  ill never go back to waxing.  less irritation for my sensitive skin.  i am one happy camper!
i came here to get a volume fill after having my lashes done at another company for a few months. the beds were very comfortable and jessica was very informative and skilled. i received info on general care and maintenance that i had not received elsewhere. i had no idea that my lashes should have lasted much longer than i had previously experienced. my fill also looked much more full than before. the price was also 25 less than i had been paying. i really liked the nanomister and the little fan they used. instead of waiting the 2 days, it was only a 4 hr downtime before my lashes could get wet. the eye pads were also more comfortable and less irritating to my eyes during the fill. in the past, i had experienced stinging from wet glue as well. not this time. i think i have found my new lash extension home!
alesha was perfect! ive had my lashes done before but they felt heavy. they felt very natural here and i loved be outcome. alesha answered all of my questions and was easy to talk to. i will definitely be back here!
the first thing i noticed when i stepped into the salon was the clean aesthetic and fragrance.  alesha greeted me with a warm smile and was super friendly in welcoming me.  she took the time to get to know me, the look i wanted, and made sure all my questions were answered before we got started.  obviously this is a pretty sensitive service, being that it involves your eyes, but i couldnt have asked for a better experience.  and my lashes look amazing.  thank you, alesha, and lash  sugar, for a job that couldnt have been more well done.  stellar service and product, convenient location, and competitively priced.
i love this lash shop! i fully complete trust getting my lashes done safely and correctly. i come to alesha and she is wonderful. i love that she is such a perfectionist because she always take her time and makes sure that they are done nice and even. theres nothing more comforting to know that you they dont rush, even within a time frame. i recommend this place!
i got sugaring done by both alesha and jessica. they do a really great job and the pricing here is fabulous!!  come in and try sugaringyou wont regret it!!
love my lashes!!! alesha was awesome! she was professional and friendly. it was a truly enjoyable experience. the salon was exceptionally clean and very pretty. pricing was exceptionally fair and beyond reasonable compared to other places i checked out. i highly recommend lash and sugar.
my first experience here, with alesha, was wonderful!  she explained to me the different options for lash extensions and helped me make the best choice for me.  the application itself was very comfortable and the results are beautiful!  my hubbie even commented how pretty they are and i am thrilled to be able to save time every morning.  i will definitely recommend the lash  sugar co and be back!
love natalie! she is so talented and listens to what you are wanting. takes great pride in her artistry and it shows!!! highly recommend!!
i super heart my delicious eyelashes that alesha gave me at the lash and sugar company. as soon as i had them, the people of the world started staring more dreamily into my eyes  saying what a natural beauty i am! they withstood a week in the ocean water of hawaii and still look great. i highly recommend alesha. she has a great energy and wonderful touch: i passed out at least twice while she was working my lashes. id have thought it would be hard to be still for that long but nope  it was blissy.
lashes for the holidays! i have been to another location before where jessica did my lashes, and i loved them! i didnt want to trust just anyone so when i found out jessica was in the scottsdale location i decided to go there. well, again i was amazed at how full yet natural they look and feel! so light and not pokey like some ive had before! so grateful for her perfectionism! amazing job jessica!!customerforlifelooklikeabeautyqueen
i have been to both this location  the newer scottsdale location  love them both! i started seeing jessica at the gilbert location  followed her to scottsdale. i found this company after having a horrible experience at another lash salon that left me with virtually no eyelashes! first of all, jessica is very professional  also very knowledgeable about lash extensions and was able to provide me with a lot of tipstricksinfo that the other salon didnt. as for my lashes, with jessicas help we were able to nurse my poor natural lashes back to health and i now have my dream lashes! jessica recommended i have the volume lashes applied and they rock they are soft  full yet fairly natural looking just what i wanted! and best of all my lash extensions are so comfortable i dont even feel them, unlike my experience with the other lash salon. i highly recommend seeing jessica for your lash needs the best part is that she is so gentle that i just take a nap while she does my lashes. talk about real beauty sleep! im addicted to my extensions  ill never go anywhere else : 
absolutely love the place so neat and organized. alicia did my eyelashes absolutely great job this place will definitely see me again
i had a great experience at the lash and sugar company! i accidentally made an appointment at the wrong location the day before thanksgiving and alesha at the scottsdale location offered to stay longer after her last client to give me a fill. my fill was great and i am very thankful for their customer service. i have been back since then and i am always pleased with my results. i also love the services they offer at the lounge. for example, they offer a 30 minute fill if you want a quick touchup instead of waiting every two weeks to get a fill. after seeing how their staff will go above and beyond for their clients  i will definitely be recommending the lounge to all family and friends. thank you!
im lashobsessed!! i get complimented a lot by close friends who know this isnt how i was born, and i love the wakeup and go but feel made up thing! alicia made me look dramatic while still natural  shes a total artist. its low maintenance to look fabulous!
kayla does my lashes ! shes amazing !! she great with meeting my needs and making sure im aware of what shes going to do . my sets last forever and i get tons of compliments !! see kayla you wont be disappointed ;
what can i say about greens and proteins?? i can tell you always been fan and this marks the third location in vegas. i can tell you that every location the food has been spot on. they have a nice diversity of healthy options, whole create your own menu section, options for smoothies really enjoy, and never had bad meal. i ended up getting the turkey club wrap with tofu fries. i think might have been the first time getting wrap. the best parts about it was instead of the normal wrap went with the spinach wrap. talk about giving the wrap not only different flavor and look! i thought was prefect compliment for the whole dish. it had ample amount of turkey and love the dressing mixed in with the greens some fresh tomato. it nice size wrap one that filling. the tofu fries. fried tofu especially hard tofu. beautiful thing. it not only healthier but taste better then fries, not at all greasy. it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. i could order whole basket of fries if i cold. the seasoning they out on the tofu is addicting.you can tell not only from the sign that just opened plus get first review. lol! it feels new, smells new, and things that tradition with the signage and logo. i believe this is the only location that the menu its electronic. i know the smoothies looked even more tasty. it rolls over couple times or least once. each time keep showing different smoothie on the menu. it making me thirsty waiting or thinking about what am going order for lunch. i like the menu. they sell different nutrition bars qwest bars to couple other brands. the cucumber water nice touch. me not really fan of but hear it not only healthy but not many places that offer it. i would say probably about the same size as the other two locations. the service nothing but five stars for me. they greeted us right after entering, offered help with the menu if needed it, friendly, and love the positive vibes. the best part about third location is super close to the house. so now truly if ever need greens and proteins fix literally bike down the street or five min drive. nice option too have in life!! 
they did it again!  very convenient location and the food and smoothies are just great...again!
we had a great experience with food we could actually feel great about while traveling which in my book is far better than good.  we also had exceptional customer service by the manager, his name was daniel and after he found out we has food sensitivities he was especially accommodating!
i have been waiting for this location to open up since the announcement earlier this year! i was so thrilled when they finally opened because it is near my work. i was unaware of the opening and luckily my coworker called to ask to see when they opened and luckily enough, it just happened to be the day when they had the soft opening.i have been working in the food and beverage industry for a few years and i know how things work when a restaurant opens up. it has only been a couple of weeks since this location opened up and i have to say that they have been doing a great job accommodating to the clientele, this location is near a business center where major companies are located including: william hill, hakkassan and multiple law firms and physician firms. this location is busy! it may not be near a gym unlike the other two locations, but it is still pretty busy. i am impressed with the way the staff is working so hard to maintain great service for a new spot that has barely opened for less than a month. i have to give a shout out to daniel and the rest of the team who constantly give their best to making a great dining experience!i have been to the other locations and i have to say that the serving size in the location seems more than the other two. i feel like i am actually getting my moneys worth here! i love building my own menu or ordering the food from the menu. the service, the food and the quality is consistent from the other two locations. there has never been a bad experience with me from the food or service. i am very happy that there is finally a location near where i live and where i work!so far, this location is working very hard for a business to open up less than a month. service is great, food tastes delicious and is consistent throughout. i know i will continuously go here!
absolutely delicious. i had the veggie burger and was blown away. helpful and friendly staff.
loved their other locations, now i have one easy to get to from my house. bison cheese steak in a cabbage wrap is to die for
a coworker recommended this place to me so i decided to give it a try today, definitely worth the trip! had a small rough cut with chicken, yummy! perfect size, too! will be a normal lunch spot from now on. try it, you wont be disappointed!!
i have heard so many good things about this place and finally tried a wrap and their hummus and pita togo. the california grilled chicken wrap, although kind of pricey, was huge and delicious. i had to save half of it cause it was so stuffed with veggies and grilled chicken. the tofu fries that came with my sandwich were to die for! they were very flavorful with just the right amount of spice and seasoning and came with a yummy chipotle sauce! the hummus was a little bland, but still fresh and hearty. i will definitely be back to try more dishes!
i love this place because of their awesome crew! shout out to blake and steven for always being so friendly and accommodating! i have never been to the other locations before but i have grown to love this one since it is closer to where i live now. it is also not too far from planet fitness on rainbow and 215 so this is definitely my favorite go to place for my postworkout meals. ive been to this location four times already and the food is fresh and delicious every time. they offer a wide selection of meals, protein shakes and smoothies. if you are watching your calorie intake, this place is great. they have low calorie pizzas and burgers!  i will definitely recommend this place if you are looking for delicious and healthy food.
i was super excited to drive by here last week and saw that they opened a location near me. we have eaten at the henderson location and fell in love with the food and smoothies there. my husband usually gets the green shake and this time i got the antioxidant chiller and it has become my favorite. our favorite food to get is the bison burger. the meat is juicy and every bite is delicious. it comes with either jicama fries or tofu fries. we are not jicama fans so we get the tofu fries and they are yummy.
so delicious !!! very happy they opened a location close to me . great crew and yummy options for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans !
this is becoming the favorite place for lunch days with my staff!if you are in the mood for an awesome salad, or even a healthy burger, this place will hook you up!  have been for both lunches and brunches. never disappointed! tons of yummy healthy options on the menu. the jicama fries are amazing!! and i love the bison burgers, i go back and forth on the jicama fries or the tofu fries, they are both so good, in completely different ways. the egg dishes are light, and tasty. i have never had a smoothie from here, but i see them making them like crazy, so i assume they are a local favorite.there is a reason why this company has different locations popping up around the city.once people discover it, they love it! dont miss out!!
everything thing ive tried here has been delicious... the greek scramble, french toast, bison wrap,  now the turkey club with avocado added to it. its all delicious this place should be on every corner around the city.
so glad that this has opened up near our house. we used to go to the other locations a few times but they were a bit far away. now that this has opened, we are visiting at least once a week, to work our way through the menu. the tofu fries are the best, and the salads are huge!! perfect for hungry people like me and my husband!
i gave their other locations 4 stars just because it was filled with annoying gym people but this location is great and has normal people too. great service super yummy food and juice.
just stopped in here because i like the named greens and protiens healthy kitchen and juicd bar even on beat the irish week.  the menu is extensive selection of healthy choices.  my favorite is all the calorie intake information for transparency on what it is you are actually eating.  i would come back again this place is tasty indeed.
service is always awesome at this location. delicious and fresh food every time. acai berry smoothie is a must and lawash flatbread veggie pizza wdaiya cheese. so. delicious!!
first time to greens and proteins after wanting to go for like forever and it exceeded my expectations!! i got the wellness juice, which was refreshing and great, and then blueberry cream cheese crepes that were just so amazing and delicious!! cant wait to go back and try something else!! staff was super friendly and helped me pick my meal, which i really appreciated!
i was really surprised of how good greens and proteins is. i had never been there,  but after my first visit ill be going there often.  service was fantastic as was the food.  i had an ahi protein salad and it was absolutely great.
i heard about this place on groupon and decided to check their menu out online.  i noticed they have bison burger and since ive been dying to try it, i thought this would be a perfect opportunity.   i was not disappointed!  their bison burger is so juicy, like literally dripping out.  it could use a tad more salt, but other than that i love it.  ive been here several times and this is all i ever get.  the service is fast and always made to order.  it smells great there too. very clean and fresh.the location i go to is near my job and they share a parking lot in a business plaza with several other restaurants and a starbucks.  it can be pretty congested during lunch time, but when you have bison on your mind none of that even matters.  love this place!
was amazed to find such a place on my visit to vegas. and it was something that everyone i was traveling with liked too. my only complain was that there was only one trash can  at the back of restaurant. which for someone to clear their table made it a pain it was a bit on the pricy side. but heathy is hard to find.
went to this location for the first time and i must say the customer service is excellent along with their healthy food :
i love this place!!!! the bison cheese steak is a i wanted to try other menu item,but im hooked. its a good portion size for the price. i usually bring one half home for later. i highly recommend the antioxidant chiller as well its delicious!!
love this place.  i come here after a work out at vegas hot.  my favorite is the chicken salad yummy
when i actually do have the funds to splurge on a healthy meal, i choose this place.they have a pretty healthy and diverse menu, so im sure youll find something to meet your cravings. my goto option is the create your own meal. this allows you to choose one protein, one green, one grain, and one dressing. let your imagination run wild here. this is the perfect opportunity to meet that delicious, healthy craving youve been having.my favorite selections for the create your own meal is salmon, asparagus, brown rice, and the lemon citrus dressing. ill have to force myself to try the other proteins one day, but im always craving for salmon whenever i eat here. theres a light crust on the salmon, but the inside cuts up perfectly! the brown rice is the perfect texture  squishy, but not watery. the asparagus is prepared just how i like it  not burnt, but thoroughly cooked.i really wish i had the funds to eat here everyday, but it can get pricey. this place is the perfect solution to eat healthy when youre too lazy to to make your own meal, but have the currency to splurge a little.
this place is awesome! the staff is there to help even though they are getting there butts kicked hands down my go to for bargains
love this place!!!!!!! i have officially giving up cold turkey walmart and switched it out for this new store super friendly employees super clean no mess  nowhere to be found you cannot go wrong with the store i am telling you youre going to love shopping here!!!!!! let me tell you how nice these cashiers are... be warned they do not accept credit cards!!! i bought my child a corn dog from the deli department and i did not know they did not accept credit cards so the cashier felt bad and ended up paying for it out of her own pocket i felt horrible needless to say i went back  to the car and brought back the 2 that she had paid out of her pocket and paid her back and made sure to to give her plenty of thank yous and told her that she made my day!!! seriously love this place i go out of my way to go grocery shopping there!!!!
i love, love, love the prices at our new winco!!! cant wait for the one to open at pebblecreek pkwy and mcdowell. this store is always neat and clean and has wide aisles. they also have the best prices on liquor.  the savings are well worth the drive.
id like to thank energreen for an exceptional job and much cleaner looking home! fast, reliable, informative, and pleasant. looking forward to my maintenance program of once a quarter! great job.
just recently hired energreen and they were so professional and did an awesome job for the price. their business is new so their equipment is brand new and my carpets and area rugs came out beautifully. they are a husband and wife team so you know when you hire them, they are the ones that will be doing the job. highly recommend them and will be recommending them to my real estate clients as well.
i would highly recommend everybody to use energreen.  they were able to make my over 3 year old, dirty, petsoiled carpet feel brand new again.  ive used other carpet cleaning services and rugdoctors from the grocery store, and they made always made my carpet feel crunchy after it dried.  not the case with energreen: they made my old  dirty carpet, literally feel soft and brand new again.  awesome job guys!
nate and sarah are professional, prompt, positive and do a great job. we had home and office furniture and carpets cleaned and they look great!!  we used the fragrance free service although they told us we could choose scent if we wanted for our chemically sensitive patients. the whole office smelled better and looked cleaner and its an easy choice to support a business who chooses products that are better for pets and people this way! we are using them for maintenance twice to 3 times yearly to maintain our carpets.  it was an easy choice after we saw and smelled the rinse water!
just tried this place for the first time. we really liked it! they have a wide array of options with various teas, juices and smoothies they can combine them in almost any combination you like. they have amazing poppers, all kinds of flavored and cool jellies  even lychee! the girls working there when we visited today were very friendly and helpful. gave us free samples of the jellies and poppers and made good suggestions.we cant wait to go back! give it a try. tasty and different!
very neat little shop. very hipster with lots of options... the creamy blended smoothies are the way to go, very good customer service. my son and i go in quite frequently and are always greeted on entrance. i love the drinks and my son loves to go see the tall tan barista working there lol. only thing i would have negative to say is music is kind of loud.
yum! walked in out of curiosity and thank goodness i did. i am not going to lie, the menu was a bit overwhelming but i asked the cashier for an opinion and she was very helpful. i also mentioned my food allergies and she made some great suggestions. i highly recommend the sparkling tea selection. the desire rocked! i also liked that the cashiers remind u of the popper and jelly flavors that come with the tea you choose in case you wish to swap flavors. the staff was all very friendly too! we happened to go back to the shopping center the very next day and i had to make sure we stopped here again. move over starbucks, this is my new favorite spot!
our new favorite treat.  this place is awesome.  our favs so far are king taro and coco  rose.  what a tasty treat!!!  been there twice and will continue to return!!! regarding the twostar review a couple below mine... the first time we were there we also thought the music was too loud, but today it was at a regular volume and we could easily carry on a conversation.  it was a much better experience.
decent boba place. they have some some unique flavor combos and the decor is fun. the staff is also very friendly. i wouldnt trust the rating below with the one star. this is a new shop with a young staff, so mistakes are bound to happen at first. plus its not that big of a deal that they dont carry caffeine free tea. theres not going to be a large demand for it. why would you come to drink tea and expect no caffeine?it seems like they must have adjusted the music volume as well, because we had no issues.
cute new place! tried the cali girl yummy strawberry, moccachino very refreshing, the original and the king taro! that was my first time trying boba teas and i have to say it was a pleasant delicious surprise! the ownersstaff were very helpful and explained our way through the menu. new place to try!
loved it!  coming from the bay area where there are boba spots in every corner, weve missed having one close by.  we frequent san tan village and stumbled upon this place by accident, just when we were bummed to find that our favorite shaved ice spot: kealani, was no longer there.  the ladies behind the counter were so enthusiastic and helpful and the drinks were perfectly refreshing for a typically hot, arizona day.  we tried the glamorous, cali girl, the original, and king taro.  loved them all!  have already been back since our first visit and definitely will keep coming back :
growing up near awesome boba joints in california and new york, i can be a little too particular. ok, i can be down right bobazilla! gosh! is that even a word? loli ordered the thai tea with organic az honey, and honey boba. no sugar please, oh and only half of the half  half. catherine was brave enough to help this lil bobazilla of a nana. catherine handled me with a smile. well done, cat! ^_^i received my yummy fave boba drink. i noticed it starts foaming. uh oh. yes. i was shaking my head as i stare at it. then cat swooped right in and offer to remake my drink properly after apologising. wtf?! proper customer service at a boba haus? naaaah!? sincerely?! outstanding, cat! you bloody rock, luv!by the time ive concluded this review, i have managed to invite a huge tribe to come check this spot out... if not today, this weekend!!! and in two hours, me, my mates, and family are returning to this very same spot for more refreshing treats!   welcome to the neighbourhood, fat straw!  welcome indeed. ^_^ 
this is not your typical, asian boba joint, but for being in gilbert, az it certainly counts! if you like drinks that arent overly sweet or too fruity and like the hint of tea, i suggest getting ice age with honey boba. seriously the most refreshing drink. and the cups remind me of the well known halfhalf boba in la. the staff is also insanely friendly! ive been here far too many times since theyve opened. its so dangerous lol. also, dont pound the straws to get it to open from the sealing your straw tip will be ruined and youll look like an idiot with a mess to clean up! i speak from experience, and i cant tell you how much boba ive consumed in a lifetime. open it from the slip on the side. youll thank me later ;
this is my latest favorite place! i was sceptical at first since im a little particular with my boba drinks.  i went and ordered a peach pal for me and a king taro for my son. omg!  my eyes widened in surprise when i was tasted the peach poppers...love it! after that first taste, i was determined to taste all of their over ice fruity drinks. i wanted to try them, so i can decide which is my top favorite.  so, for 3 days now, i go there everyday thank god the store is near our place!.  my son  husband is all for the blended creamy drinks while im partial with the over ice fruity drinks.  now, im not done tasting all of it but i will probably now whats my top favorite next weekend.  if youre near san tan mall, check it out! tons of menu selections and im pretty sure one of those drinks will tickle your fancy.
been here a few times and try something new every time. i havent found a bad thing yet! the staff is friendly too and very helpful!
this is going to be trouble for me. i love the boba. they have a great variety...everything from frappacino like drinks to coffee to juicesmoothieish.
cute cozy place and refreshing summer drinks.
some of the best boba tea ive had, including the places ive tried in california. i was a little skeptical about the honey boba at first, because i dont like it too sweet, but it ended up tasting like standard boba. i ordered the high thai, which is basically chai milk tea with boba. i finished it way faster than i normally finish that much, and when it was gone i was sad i didnt have more!a word to people new in the area like me: this place is in a walking mall. its not the kind of place where you park out front and run in for some tea. plan to park a little ways away and walk over to the place. or you might plan to stop by during a day of shopping. i didnt realize it was in a mall and ended up driving around looking for the place for longer than i would have liked. which isnt the actual establishments fault but it is worthy of note for the review.
i love this place!!! they are sooo good, i get the south beach with boba added and its soooo good. i recommend it to everyone.
such a cool concept that every time my daughter and i are at san tan mall she asks for fat straw. the staff is very patient to explain what the drinks are as it is a little overwhelming all that they have to offer.
so happy to have a boba tea shop in az. very flavorful and convenient. well enjoy many more visits to fat straw.
i have been to this place way too many times since it opened a few months back. the employees are always sweet and welcoming when you walk through the door. when it gets busy and it does get very busy for such a small spot, they do a great job of being efficient without making it seem like they are pushing you out the door. not to mention, the boba rocks!
this place is great! here on a sunday was very busy.... employees very nice and helpful. we will be coming back to try many flavors. new favorite treat place. we tried love story daughter she loved it and south beach very good and not too sweet.
this is exactly what we needed on this side of town! the pm peach, mango and white tea with mango poppers drink is amazing. it usually just comes with mango poppers. but i also add peach poppers, which is highly recommended. the workers are always friendly and willing to answer any questions. enjoy!
we love it here!!! i love the cali girl and original honey boba tea, double boba no ice  catherine and the rest of the girls know us as regulars! thanks for always helping us with a smile.
they messed up my order by placing jelly in my drink but it wasnt bad. i love boba and this place hits the spot and they are very friendly.
really, really, good boba. very modern and americanized but it doesnt depreciate the quality of the drinks at all.
amazing drinks, wonderful people, great atmosphere! love it here! i love the spring break! mango a go go is pretty awesome also
yum! i always get the enchanted chai with coconut milk and honey boba. one day ill venture out and try something new. my kids like getting a tiny cup of strawberry poppers.
can not get enough of fat straw!!! all the drinks are yummy! janessa has been a rock star the last couple of visits taking our orders. all the staff is friendly. make sure you find a drink you like. they are unique, and you have to find one you love. have patience and visit a few times. i know thats hard for us americans.
if you dont want to pay five bucks for tea then dont go here. i love the atmosphere and the drinks are worth it to me. but again if you think five dollars is too much for tea then just dont go. definitely try the love story best drink there
i love this place! i have always loved boba, and the only place in the east valley that i knew selling boba was the korean spot the street by mcc. this place is a bit different in the creative combinations that they have to offer. and location! its great to go shopping or finish watching a movie and stop by for some yummy boba drinks. my mom loves it, i love it, and my 12 yr old loves it. just a great spot to hang out or stop by when we are out and about at san tan. yummy, yummy, you have to try :
the new drive thru location is now open! right off of tatum and shea! beautiful location, thats got a great outside seating area with misters! so happy that theres finally a drive thru location on my way too work. this isnt a location that has an inside seating area but thats ok, theres a few others around that do offer that. today was there official opening day and to say i got my drink and food quickly and efficiently. so excited to make this location my new regular stop!
love this new location. hardly ever a line and if there is, it moves quickly. they get my order right every time.

came on their grand opening! i got to try viris specialty drink while enjoying the music by live mariachi.las tarascas had very friendly staff  tasty authentic mexican food! i couldnt stop eating
excellence service and amazing food! one of my favorite dishes was the chicken fajitas it was delicious!
the service was amazing and not solely due to not being as busy.  they were accommodating and attentitive in addition to having amazing soup and salsa to start out the meal.  i would recommend the hotter salsa due to better flavor than the regular just ask the server for the hotter stuff.  we did the 3 item combo definitely recommend the cheese enchilada and chili verde burrito.  they smother the cheese enchilada with cheese.
from beginning to end this restaurant surpassed my expectations. started with the queso fundido which was so rich and sweet yet spicy enough to capture the heart of your tastebuds. then moved on to the shrimp cocktail with the perfect balance of ingredients inside. moving on to my entree was the mojarra frita just like my mom used to make and i couldnt have asked for anything different. just to finish the meal fried ice cream to cleanse the tastebuds so delicious i cant wait to return!
the food was great. the beer was extremely cold. thats it im sold. ask for viri she was amazing thanks
you know?..there are plenty mexican restaurants in town, but every now and then you you run into one that totally stands out from all the others and lucky for me this is the case with las tarascas michoacanas. the food is amazingly good! the place is nice and clean with minimal decorations and although it lacks some more mexican colors, the arches on the wall are a nice touch giving it a feel of authenticity. service was great, this is a family owned restaurant and they really make you feel like you are part of it. they constantly check on you to refill your beverages and to make sure youre enjoying your meal to the fullest.i ordered the gallina zamorana, thats chicken covered with a special strawberry sauce and mushrooms, something i never had before and it was delicious, specially with the freshly handmade tortillas. we also tried the enchiladas dona andrea and we loved them but let me warn you, this are authentic mexican enchiladas and not the ones most people are accustomed to here on the states, so if youre a green grow, i recommend you try the regular enchiladas.we really had a great time here at las tarascascas, ask for viri i think that was her name she will definitely take good care of you! i cant wait to come back and try other items on the menu that sounded delicious, the only bad part is that i live so far from this place, but as my friend would say..... i usually dont hang around on this side of town but when i do i eat at las tarascas michoacanas.....dont stay hungry my friends..try them!great foodawesome servicesuper margaritas
great food. if you want authentic food this is a good place to go to. since the moment you get there until you leave you can sense the great customer service. something the east side of the valley definitely needed. the food is simply amazing. i mean if you are gonna go and want to judge the food try some real food. chicken, steak, shrimp. dont go to have regular red enchiladas or steak fries and knock the place. the drinks are really good theres a particular one that sells a lot called la michoacana mango margarita with mexican chamoy and  tajun around the rim . they have two musicians not mariachi and they are amazing, courtesy of the restaurant all you have to do is tip the gentlemen if you want to. the ceviche is made at your table which isnt seen anywhere else. check it out and you be the judge
i can say this is home made mexican food. compared to other mexican restaurants. this is one of my new favorites. the customer service was above expectations.first time coming here and i will be returning!we went for my friends birthday party.we had a party of 15 people and i cant complain about anything. we sat down and right away they got our drinks ordered and appetizers and in less than 5 minutes we were eating! food was full of flavor. lalo was our server he was very attentive and on top of everything. i didnt even have to ask for a refill, because he was very attentive and he made us all feel welcomed. i really recommend this place!
second time  here and i would have to say i am definitely coming back for more. super friendly service and very nice decor, makes me feel like im at my grandmas house. i enjoyed a specialty cocktail called la michoacana, the perfect combination of sweet sour and alcohol. then queso fundido came out sizzling and tasted just asgood as it looked. next table side presentation of ceviche made just the way you like it. finally my entree of chicken fajitas did not disappoint, i heard my plate sizzling across the room made for an exciting reveal. very good! my new go to place for mexican food!!
the service was awesome. prices were very reasonable. the food was awesome. great menu. true mexican food! not that chipotle. please do your self a favor and treat your self to some good food.also, things to try:  quesadillas    steak    chicken the specialty drink amazing its  an alcoholic beverage, comprised of mango, lime and a couple other fruits and tequila.
went here a couple of times but the last time i was here really stood out to me and will make me a local for this mexican joint. we came here a week after my girlfriends birthday. i ordered my girl one of those bomb mango margaritas...frickin delicious! but as we were finishing up all the employees, cooks included came out of the back and sang happy birthday to my girlfriend! mind you i didnt even tell them it was her birthday. they must have noticed the date on the id when checking her age. they got her a churro cake and a shot of tequila on the house!! we were both blown away and had me cracking up the way they made her take the shot! lol love the crew here. family owned local restaurant check them out!
everything was great! the server, daniel, was one of the best servers ive ever had at any restaurant. he was friendly, passionate, and knowledgable. he seems to know everything about each dish. all the employees we met were nice and we will request daniel in the future.as for the food, huge portions that are delicious. we got the jalapenos with shrimp and chorizo as well as a four item combo. the four item combo was massive. had to box up half of it. my dad got the fried fish and they let him try multiple sauces. one of the sauces had strawberry in it and was the only thing i didnt like that i tried. the fish was great though and the garlic sauce was amazing if youre a garlic lover.we wanted to try desert they have fried ice cream but got too full. we will be back!
had to try this restaurant since we love mexican food and we were very happy. the food is fresh and hot. salsa is unique, very tasty and the bean dip w chips are awesome. the fideo soup was fun with alphabet pieces kids will love it  but has a great flavor. i was pleasantly surprised when our server, cesar, brought us lightly sauteed onion and jalapeno slices. very fresh and tasty.  i ordered beef taquitos and my son, chris, ordered carne asada tacos. yum to both. definitely recommend this restaurant. nice and clean too.alan told us about the weekend special that his grandmother makes called corundas. gotta try them!!!!
this place was the bomb diggity! just drove by and walked on. what a lucky find. the food was fresh and authentic. the homemade tortillas were incredible. prices were very reasonable! a must try. ill be back.
great everything!!!!!! the service, the food, the environment, all was so great! cant wait to return.
pollo a la zamorana.  cerveza pollo fambam thankyamaam rhymes postworkoutfoodadventurethursday nomnomnom turnedmyfamilyintofoodies food adventures authentic love this place has yummie food and its close to home. great atmosphere, too!illbeback
do not pass this one by.   what a pleasant surprise.   the food was absolutely outstanding.   the only thing that could top the food was the service.   it is a family owned establishment and you can certainly feel the pride this restaurant has in delivering a fantastic dining experience.   we will be regulars here.
i had written a review on this restaurant, but for some reason it got deleted. i just want to say that they have genuine mexican food here!! very fun and exciting environment. we decided to come here for a friends birthday party dinner. we were a party of 15 people, and i must say service was exceptional for a party of 15. i never had to ask for a refill because our server was very attentive. the food was delicious! great portions for the price!i recommend this las tarascas for all of my mexican food lovers!
this place was amazing...servers and bus boys were great help and very nice....food was extremely delicious...had a chance try the corundas and absolutely loved them...will definitely go back.
love the food n service!!! they not only brought chips n salsa, which i didnt really care for, but also brought bean dip n grilled onions n jalapenos!!! when i asked what they used in their mole he brought me a sample to try!! super friendly n hospitable!! and the food was very good as well!!! definitely recommend!!!
this is a great new find. the place doesnt look like your usual mexican restaurant but dont let that fool you. the food and service is great. i had the vaca moreliana new yotk steak and it was the best steak i had in a very long time.
my husband and i visited for the first time on sunday evening. as we were walking to our table, my husband passed out. the establishment immediately called 911 and while waiting for their arrival the family and entire staff were extremely attentive. they continued to do so for our entire stay once the paramedics left. both my husband and i were impressed and verytouched by their care.by the way, once all was ok we stayed and had a delicious dinner. no doubt, las tarascas will be our favorite place...yummy food, good prices and great humans!!!!!
first time here earlier today its so hard to find good restaurants in the east side but i found this place on yelp and it had high reviews do i decided why not lets give it a try  this place is great everyone was so nice and helpful i dont speak spanish lol nor does my grandma they were very helpful with helping us make selections i usually eat the same thing but i saw somthing that sparked my interested i forgot the name but it had strawberry cream sauce which i thought was interesting‼ i must say i wasnt disappointed it was super yummy i would totally go back ive never heard anyone recommend this place to me before but it totally needs more publicity!!!!

i went here for lunch with a group of 5. the options were plentiful and a great pricevalue. the staff was very friendly and attentive. you would never know from the outside how great it is. dont just drive by! stop by and try this delicious mexican food!
excellent! best mexican restaurant ive been to in a long time. had the carne asada burrito and tacos, it all was very good. food and service is great.
amazing service,  amazing food, great place to hang out with my love while we talk and stuff our faces. yum coming back for more tamales for sure.
i recommend the fitness camp to anyone!  the workouts are challenging and varied. working out with a group helps keep me motivated, not to mention the new friendships.  classes are outside, its beautiful in the mornings! todd is an excellent trainer.  knowledgable, encouraging, entertaining, and pushes you just enough. like i said at the beginningi would recommend tfc to anyone!
love the fitness camp!!!! todd makes the best workouts ever, time flies by! weve never done the same workout twice... the fact that its different every time makes me want to keep going. todd is very knowledgeable and has a lot of different equipment to mix it up for us. after the workout i feel great that i challenged myself and im ready to start my day positively. just finished my first 4 week camp and i will definitely be signing up for the next! youre the best todd!
ive been yoyoing between working out regularly and being a couch potato.  my slogging slow jog regimen wasnt cutting it. it became clear that my rollercoaster fitness routine wasnt working. i needed to commit to something challenging that would shake things up. i was sick and tired of being out of shape and sluggish. i needed a remedy asap. fitness camp to the rescue.... im wrapping up my second full week and can honestly say i have loved every single class. im surviving and feel energized, alive, and unstoppable. i simply peel myself off my bed at 5 am and get to class to get it done.  its great to be outdoors working out and taking in the view of the mountains and sunrise. getting up early is getting easier and i truly feel amazing after i each class. i finish class out of breath and with a smile. who knew being sore could be this incredibly awesome?!todd, our trainer, is certified by the national strength and conditioning association nsca  which is important because he is super knowledgeable about his craft. each class has been challenging but doable. the class size isnt overwhelming 78 for the 5:30 am class and is efficient 45 minutes in its entirety. every day is different and he builds upon the day before. you will be pushed within your limits. the workouts are scalable and can be customized to your personal fitness level. youre never doing the same workout and the variety keeps me interested and challenged.  the fitness camp is held at huckleberry park corner of farm  egan crest in the nw community of providence. the classes run monday  friday and are held at 5:30 am, 6:15 am, and 8:15 am new class for next session. all you need to bring is a yoga mat for floor work, a towel and your water bottle. todd will supply all the fitness equipment for the workouts.final verdict: i love this camp and feel it is worth every penny! i never feel judged and my classmates and todd are awesome. although i only wrapping up my second week, im very excited to complete the month and continue on with the fitness camp. my husband is doing this with me and were both excited to see the results from sticking to it.
very excited massage green finally opened in north scottsdale. ive been going to the glendale location but this one is much closer to my home. great service at a great price and super friendly staff.
this was my first facialmassage and im so glad i came here! the staff was very welcoming and the environment was so peaceful. alana did my facial and she is amazing! she truly made the whole experience for me! highly recommend :
had a great first visit! anecia was incredible for a deep tissue if that is what you truly like lots of pressure and worked everything very well! will definitely be back!
love elite nails! i have been going here for minipedi and lip wax for the last 7 years.  they can almost always fit me in with very little waiting. they are very polite and capable. whenever outoftown family is here, we go there for pedicures. everyone ive taken here has been pleased.  i think their prices are reasonable.
ive been coming here for years and it is perfect every time!  people are nice and the atmosphere is very relaxing!  everything is perfectly clean!
wow! 5 different eggs benedict dishes? french press italian organic lavazza coffee!? yes!what a beuatiful space. just what this area needed,  is an upscale, trendy breakfast and lunch spot!first thing you encounter when you walk into the restaurant is the amazing circular bloody mary bar, with so many accompaniments to your deliciously mixed breakfast boozy drink. you can add as little or as much to your bloody mary as you would like. crazy.the benedicts are out of this world. i had the crab cake benedict, and it was amazing. it was packed with fresh crab and the hollandaise was savory with just a touch of lemon. i actually added avocado to mine, which i think completed the flavor.coffee is served in individual tall french presses, finished at the table. very nice touch! the coffee they use is organic lavazza coffee from italy. lavazza just happens to be my favorite,  because it has such a mild, nutty flavor with a hint of chocolate without any bitterness.the brisket hash will have you drooling, it was so good. they smoke the brisket in house,  since they own the bbq place next door. the flavor complimented the scrambled eggs we had, which we also added cheese to.we cant wait to come back for lunch, they have some really good looking sandwiches on the menu we want to try.the service was excellent, everyone was all smiles and very attentive. the owners joey and cristina were on hand to greet guests and make sure everyone loved their food. their hands on approach makes a difference, they were so nice.overall, a definite regular spot. the food was very good, menu had plenty of choices and attentive service.

didnt even know that cuttlefish was gone, but being a huge fan of breakfast, im glad we happened to notice the signage had changed. since its a weekday and they havent had their grand opening yet, we were among the few patrons this morning, but everything was fantastic! the service was delightful, just the right level of attentive without  being intrusive, and the food... the food was perfect. i had the nutella and banana french toast, when it came out i thought they had brought me plain french toast, but tucked away between those layers of bread was delicious chocolatey goodness. the hubs had a brisket hash brown skillet, he loved that there was cornbread in the dish as well as on the side. the french press coffee was a nice touch, and another day read: not a workday well be coming back for mimosas.
this brunch spot is absolutely to die for! we were so excited to see a breakfast spot open up near shea and scottsdale. the maggiores did it again with this gem! we walked in and were welcomed with bright smiles and a fabulous french press full of fine italian coffee. the experience only got better when i ordered the coconut and almond encrusted fresh toast. my mouth was in heaven. this will be our new favorite breakfast place!
fried chicken salad sandwich. sound different?  had to try it and it was wonderful. well be back soon.
finally! scottsdale needed a brunch spot like this! the build your own bloody mary bar is by far the best ive seen in the area. they have every topping you could imagine... something like 40 different options. and dont even get me started on their food! to die for. i am a harsh critic of eggs bennies, and the three out of five ive tried so far were absolutely delicious. they really have everything you could possibly want for brunch. i could eat here every single day. their hashes are sooooo good, they have fried chicken and waffles, french toast, red velvet pancakes... its like i died and went to heaven. needless to say, i am a huge fan of this spot. the overall vibe and atmosphere is just great and somewhere ill probably take my friends weekly. i definitely recommend you check it out!
the hash kitchen provides a delicious yet engaging culinary experience. the bloody mary bar is unlike anything i have ever seen before where you can choose from over 40 different toppings and custom create the cocktail yourself. i would also highly recommend the red velvet pancakes, a breakfast treat that is not overly sweet and well worth the calories. the owners, joey and cristina are all about customer service and making sure everything exceeds expectations.
we are always looking for a good breakfast spot and are sick of the chain restaurants.  we stopped by the hash kitchen today and were rewarded with an outstanding breakfast.  our waiter, leo, was an excellent server.  very attentive and knowledgable, but without being smothering.  i ordered a frittata which was delicious!  the homemade biscuits are to do die for!!  my husband ordered the corned beef hash and loved it.  the french press coffee was wonderful and a nice touch to the meal!!  my only recommendation would be to change the music.  i didnt care for the techno beat music.  overall an excellent experience!!  we cant wait to go back.
oh my goodness gracious. i feel like im in a food coma right now... just left this establishment and i am wishing i had a bigger stomach. it took us so long to decide on what to order because so many items sounded so good. i ended up with the lump crab cake eggs benedict that was no joke. there was plenty of crab meat! i am laughing as i compose this review because i told my boyfriend the eggs were poached perfectly and the table next to us heard me say that. they said, did i just hear you say the eggs were poached perfectly? turns out, it was the owner and the chef sitting next to us but we didnt know that until we got a complimentary cinnamon sugar donut dessert with a vanilla creme sauce at the end of our meal. i was so full but my sweet tooth could not resist the donuts that were laid upon a nutella spread and the sauce complimented it so well. brian started with a bloody mary from the bar instead of going to the diy bloody mary bar  big mistake. he missed out on the fun of making one himself and there were so many toppings. not your typical bloody mary bar. the toppings looked amazing and i think i saw oysters. if youre not a bloody mary fan, this place might make you one. for his meal, he got the fried chicken eggs benedict and it was scrumptious. definitely a lot of food and probably full of calories but its worth it. typical eggs benedicts come with an english muffin but they used biscuits and it paired nicely. he wanted the chilaquilies not sure if i spelled it correctly at first but it is another reason to go back to this restaurant. everyone seemed to be ordering this dish. for a refreshing drink, brian ordered the pineapple mojito. im not sure if there was a certain name for the cocktail but if you are sitting on the patio, it seems like it would be perfect for a warm day. we are so happy we found this place and i am happy i got brian to try out a new place. we will definitely be back to try more of the menu and we will bring friends and family. the staff was very knowledgeable in the menu and really friendly. i cant remember the hostess name but she was super nice and gave us a warm welcome and goodbye. we also heard that they are bringing in a dj for the weekend. i have a feeling this place is going to be the hip, classy breakfast joint in central scottsdale. great job and thank you christina and joe!
today i had the nutella and banana french toast. ...awesome. great flavor! my wife had the crab benny again, it  is soooo friggin good! no pics today, we attacked our food so fast! lol.i keep forgetting to mention, the kids meals are really big and tasty and only five bucks! choc chip pancakes, scrambled eggs, grill cheese panini, fresh homemade chicken tenders, etc.. the kids love the food and we love the fact that the kids meals are thoughtfully prepared. most place dont take the time or effort to make good kids meals!see my original review below!
food  55 stars  i had the lump crab eggs benedict  the nutella  banana french toast. hands down the best eggs benny ive had in a long time! french toast was just decadent! oh,  the nectur of the gods they serve with it home made maple syrup is something straight from heaven. our meal was pretty much perfect!service  55 stars  wait staff was attentive  worked well together. we didnt have to hardly ask for anything. they were on it! ask for jesus, he was great. very knowledgeable and friendly.  ambiance  5  5 stars  awesome! witty sayings  quotes on the wall in a chalk mural style! love it! bloody mary bar was a nice touch, too!value  5  5 stars  inexpensive for the whole family. overall 5 starswill i be back? yeswould i recommend to a friend? yes
this place is not a 5 star! its a 10 star! the ambiance is amazing! the bloody marry bar....only a genius can come up with that idea! the food was delicious. smoked brisket and eggs....amazing! the fried chicken with hash browns breakfast...even better! i am so glad we tried this place out! cant wait  to come back!
i am the ceo of snooze eatery a breakfast place and had the pleasure of eating at the hash kitchen this morning. you have to give credit where credit is due and the hash kitchen is awesome. the atmosphere is upscale and vibrant  a great way to start the day. the staff was incredible, from being greeted the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left. and the food  first rate in every way. the menu is diverse and the quality is through the roof. congratulations to hash kitchen!
if youre looking for an ordinary breakfast meal, any place will be fine. but if you have a refined palate and want an amazing breakfast, go to hash kitchen! this brand new place offers a large selection of breakfast meals like eggs benedict, burgers, salads, pancakes, and more...and for the second time i was speechless!! the smoked salmon eggs benedict that i ordered was delicious and cooked to perfection!! my friend had the italian sausage eggs benedict and she was impressed too! melissa, our waitress, was friendly and professional. the entire staff welcomes you with a big smile. very important factor. parking is available anywhere you like in the plaza. conclusion: i recommend this place and ill come back soon with more buddies!! ;
i am very impressed by this brunch spot that is centrally located in scottsdale literally. as a north scottsdale resident and someone who is really familiar with brunch after living in southern california, its really refreshing to have the hash kitchen nearby with a creative menu including endless delicious options with a social atmosphere. as a twenty something professional, the hash kitchen is a great restaurant for business meetings but is also the ideal space to gather with friends for a weekend brunch gathering with the dj and morning cocktail options.i highly recommend the lump crab and sweet potato hash for a savory dish and the encrusted coconut and almond french toast for a sweet option. the service is top notch and our server was always on top of our orders and coffee refillsbeverages.if youre a foodie or a brunch enthusiast, this is the place to be!
fantastic new breakfastlunch place  great atmosphere, lots of choices  the best corned beef hash ive ever had!!!  definitely two thumbs up!  it will be even better when the weather permits outside dining  staff were very friendly  helpful.  try it out!
in town for work and found this place on yelp, the diy bloody mary bar sold me. sure enough the bloodies were amazing, service was great and the food was great. actually came back the next morning to grab some more of the food before i headed out of town. great place.
the breakfast menu is exceptional.  grand opening weekend offered complimentary berry infused mimosa.  got the lump crab bennie and was very impressed.  egg was cooked to prefection, biscuit was light and fluffy with an ample amount of crab.  the side if potatoe was just okay.  tried the bloody mary bar.... with endless possibilities.  um ya yum.
awesome bloody mar bar, super extensive with hundreds of options. bacon, slim jims, all sorts of shellfish and pickled veggies.... i had the chicken and waffles that feature bacon in the waffle, eggs, and fried leeks. awesome. the hashes and chilaquiles at the table were excellent as well.
this place is awesome!!!! everybody that works there is extremely nice, especially the owners and the bartender!! i drove 35 minutes just to get there and would have driven an hour if i had to, this food is amazing!! best breakfast ive had in a really long time!! will definitely be coming back over and over!! keep up the good work!!
an absolute must! i am a big breakfast fan. definitely a threat to all breakfast restaurants in scottsdale. lemon ricotta pancakes hit it right on the mark. hot with a wonderful light and citrus flavor. i love butterfields biggest reason is the speed of the food but they matched it here but with more of an upscale flair. leo my server was great. youre missing out if you dont try this place. prices are more than reasonable.
this will be the weirdest review ive ever written. my wife is diabetic and a kidney transplant patient. she cannot eat poached eggs. we ordered coffee and water and looked over the menu. she decided on a pancake and asked for sugar free syrup. the waiter responded kindly that all they had was maple syrup. we were surprised that a breakfast restaurant did not have sugar free syrup and decided not to eat here. i tried to pay the server for our coffee but he was very kind and denied to take my payment. he also apologized for not having sugar free syrup. we did not eat here but gave it a 5 star rating based on their kindness and professional attitude. we will not be able to go back but really appreciated how we were treated.
let me start with yum!! the food was great and the menu options amazing! we started with their donuts which they offered for a starter or a dessert. we went with a starter. three full size donuts with three holes. i should have stopped there. the breakfast burrito could feed the block. i suggest cutting it in half and starting there. you wont make it to both ends. the nutella and banana french toast was delicious. im not a nutella fan although i could tell after a taste that any of their french toasts would be great. lightly dipped and airy. i received an order of their crab benedict. it wasnt what i ordered but the amount of crab meat was insane!! a must order if you like bennies. they brought out my sweet potato and crab hash within minutes. they are very generous with their crab meat. the best part, they have the most insane bloody mary bar ever!! the vibe was good. a little too early for a dj but the music wasnt too loud so it worked. i would hands down recommend this place for breakfast. i look forward to trying it for lunch and cant wait to meet a group for bloody marys.
wow! great breakfast! great service. from the moment we walked in, everyone was so nice, despite being extremely busy. tm the place was jammed and they handled it well. we had to wait 30 minutes, but we didnt mind, we heard the food is fabulous. when we were seated, service was friendly and efficient.  our server, jesus, was wonderful. i had a lovely bloody mary from the do it yourself bloody mary bar. what an impressive assortment! i ordered the red velvet pancakes, which were decadent and divine. my hubby had the brisket hash, which he loved. i tasted his hash and it was so flavorful and delicious. we both had a french press of italian coffee, how thoughtful to have individual, fresh  french press style coffee! delicious. we were very impressed and love the atmosphere. the dj on a sunday morning was a cute touch and elevated the vibe of the whole place. he wasnt too loud at all, just right to have pleasant conversation. the owners were buzzing from table to table making sure everyone was enjoying their experience. what a nice couple.i believe we just found our new regular weekend spot for early dining!
the most fun i have ever had a breakfast place.  the atmosphere was vibrant and happy and the staff were cheerful and energetic.  the build your own bloody mary bar is enough reason to visit but the food is dynamite.  we couldnt decided if the nutella and banana french toast, red velvet pancakes or brisket hash was the best at our table.  our son has two severe food allergies and our server and the owner went out of their way to be sure that it was safe for him to eat.  they brought the ingredient list out to show me!  you rarely get restaurants to understand how important a food allergy is and never get that kind of service.  the customer service is the best we have experienced.  i see why the place is so busy.  great prices for families!
go to this place!  my hats off to joey, the creator of this much needed new breakfast lunch place in central scottsdale. the menu is unique, simple to understand and lots of great choices. the ambience is relaxing and the place jams with energy vibrating from the ground to the walls and hopefully through to the customers!i have the salmon eggs benedict.  excellent!  my date has some egg dish, which i cant recall the name of it, but they said it was awesome as well.  the french coffee was amazingly good too.
pretty place, very good food, awesome service ! we dont often go out for breakfast, but this was a special day. leo, our server, made our experience very special ! he suggested the french press coffee, and showed up at just the right time to press and pour. he recommended a fruit plate while we looked over the menu, which was perfect for a leisurely style brunch experience. leo seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and encouraged us to ask any questions; we chose the smoked salmon eggs benedict and the brisket and eggs, based on his recommendations, both were filling and flavorful, and just as he described .too full for dessert, but he said he made a killer mocha which we shared, our only mistake not getting two; we will be back, great brunch experience !
bloody. mary. bar.not just some crap fixings and garbage vodka.  titos. house made infused vodkas.  bacon.  bacon salt. pickled everything...and the food is freaking awesome.  this place is a winner.
great service!! ask for chris super funny guy. the food was delicious!! i had the salmon benedict that was topped with sauteed red onion and tomatoes with a fluffy biscuit and of course the classic hollandaise sauce. my boyfriend had the black forest ham scrambler with a side of hash house potatoes. if your looking for good food and great service this is the place to be!
you must try the hash kitchen...this is the best breakfast place in town!  ive gone back three weekends in a row. normally, i stick with the same menu item when i find a good thing, but i have tried something different every time. there is something here for everyone, from healthy to decadent. try the salmon benedict, one of the hash skillets or the waffles! you really cant go wrong, everything ive tried is amazing and they have the best biscuits ive ever had! they even have french press coffee. i cant wait to try their lunch. i saw a chinese chicken salad go by that looked to die for. the hash kitchen does not disappoint and the staff and service was second to none! exceptional all around!
its a brand new restaurant so theyre still getting into the swing of things but i definitely loved my experience.
delicious and beautiful. had the fried chicken benny and those fried leeks were just heaven on top. hot sauce on the side and was fire. would have preferred tabasco or tapatio.the wait was a little long but what can you really expect on a sunday, am i right?grapefruit mimosas...nuff said.one negative: music was slightly too loud. was a dj really worth it? i personally think not.
great place. chris and rachel were very friendly and welcoming. the food was awesome, i got the american scramble and a pancake for my son. well be back!
this is probably the most amazing breakfast ive had in the valley.  the food was fabulous, lots of options for savory and sweet.  blood mary bar. coffee in every style including french press. for those of you who like the traditional benedict on an english muffin, they are happy to accommodate! ask for chris at your server. he has super recommendations and a great spirit!
my hubby and i are from gilbert staying in scottsdale for a staycation. we yelped this place and decided to try it out. so delicious. food was amazing, with a great big portion. we would recommend the breakfast burrito hands down. the service was remarkable. the dj was an added plus. we will be back for sure.
awesome food, bloody mary bar and dj craig was killer! it is a sunday funday favorite!
hash was amazing! went for brunch with the chicas and chris was the best server that we have ever had anywhere! bloody bar rocked our world!
this place is great.  i live in scottsdale and we are surrounded by a lot of beautiful, high priced, ok food with servers who are just trying to get through the day.  not the hash kitchen.  yes its new, yes its pretty and comfy and aesthetically pleasing, so pleasing i had a bloody mary at noon, but its more.  the food is fresh and delicious but the people made the difference.  i would be pleased to meet a client there or have brunch.  today,i was met by a lovely lady outside the front door welcoming me and letting me know my girlfriend was already there.  then i met our server chris.  chris and his quick wit made it ok for us to drink in the middle of the day.  i appreciated that.  he led the way to the bloody mary bar bmb and mixed up the basics for us 1st using one of their own infused vodkas.  tina, aka gina, and i had a vodka infused with cilantro and i added some habanero for a spicy kick.  he then waved his left hand out, palm up and to the side as if to say ta da, inviting us to add over 20 side items to our drink.  2 thick pieces of bacon to start, oysters chilling on ice, horseradish which i stupidly added after the habanero, 3 kinds of olives, at least 3 kind of pickles, i think i saw a whole egg, maybe asparagus?, im not sure, i saw salami and slim jims and was done.  slim jim.  im not going to lie, i was real classy, i put 1 in my purse and gave it to my husband when i got home.  we also met fellow server anthony and the proud owner joey who between those 2 and chris, id just go back for the comedy team.  i know whats going to happen.  people are going to catch on about how great this place is and ill never get a breakfast seat again, maybe ill get an honorary booth in the back.  im going back for chicken and waffles, bacon in the waffle yes please!, and nutella and banana french toast.  your fan, keri aka terry.
i love this place. it is awesome atmosphere and the food its great. the drinks and staff top
in the gainey ranch shops at the previous cuttlefish location. good size restaurant and vertical modern building. the old oyster bar from cuttlefish with the scooter seats are transformed into a bloody mary bar.had the build your own scramble with chorizo, italian sausage and mushrooms which was excellent. it came with a small container of hash browns and a home made biscuit.  everything was excellent,  the chorizo was just right not to hot but with enough kick to give it flavor.  the mushrooms were plentiful and the italian sausage was very good. the hash browns were good and the home made biscuit was fresh and soft.the disk jockey playing the music was different in a breakfast  lunch place. was good to liven up the place but at times was difficult to hear the other person talk.the service  was excellent as our waiter ryan made sure everything was right and for having a party of 14 he handled every need without an issue. was also a nice touch that the owner came by to talk with us.will be back to try the lunch menu and especially the burgers that looked very good on the menu
the breakfast here is delicious. ive gone a few times with friends so ive tried many items and am always impressed by how good the food is. they have amazing bloody marys and mimosas as well. much better than the typical ihop or good egg fast food type breakfast. your meal is actually individually made to order which is hard to find these days. being from the east coast where we have diners everywhere, it has been hard to find a place to get a delicious breakfast here. its also nice to have a classier place to go for breakfast, not many options for something like that. ive had rachel and ryan as servers when i go and theyre both attentive, friendly and helpful about choosing menu items. i look forward to more delicious meals and drinks here!
we ordered the thk hash herb chicken and lump crab. the herb chicken was my fav.! the had leek strip that was lightly battered and glazed with honey. delicious. the lump crab was good but i felt like it was missing something.  maybe a gravy of some sort? the server recommend the hollandaise with it. we also tried their original bloody mary. it was very spicy so we asked them to dilute it with a little more tomato juice but otherwise good. the best part of this experience was the customer service. at first we thought the wait was going to be long. the lady in the front was telling the group ahead of us 30mins to an hr and we were going to leave. but she cleared a high top for us so we could be seated immediately. the server and manager was equally nice, stopping over to make small talk and joke with us. i love how every person there is working; management and all. thats how a restaurant is suppose to operate.  not just management pointing fingers for other people to do work. they were busy and they all help clear tables and bus. keep up the great work guys! 
the service was fantastic and they really step it up. you really can kick breakfast up a notch and they do it.
this place is a gem! super sweet staff from the moment you walk in the door who create a fun experience. the bloody mary bar is awesome and the food is fantastic. this is by far our favorite breakfast spot in scottsdale.
our server rachael was wonderful. she was very attentive and gave great recommendations as it was our first time dining here! the bloody mary bar looked amazing although we didnt try it this time. food was great, staff was friendly and attentive . wonderful breakfast spot!
where else can you make your own bloody mary?!  we tried the jalapeno and cilantro vodka and both were great.  additions included hot peppers, bacon, asparagus, green beans, pickles, worcestershire sauce and pretty much anything else you could want...even bacon rimming the glasses.  foodwise, the chicken and waffles were tasty, with bacon inside the waffles and juicy chicken, with the fried leeks adding a nice touch.  berry stuffed pancakes with mascarpone were delicious as well.  interior was tastefully decorated and chris was a great attentive server.  definitely come here if youre in the area!
good quality breakfasts, with a lot of variety to choose from. a lot less greasyfatty than you would expect given the types of foods they are cooking. everyone in my party got something different, and was happy and didnt go home hungry, or overstuffed.drinks were excellent, especially the house bloody marys. going to be my goto brunch in scottsdale
outstanding service, make your own bloody mary bar is way cool, large food portions, neat breakfast experience.
absolutely loved this place  the venue and atmosphere is super cute clean and elegant but not stuffy! the service was impeccable and the food was fantastic. i had the smoked salmon eggs benedict which came in two biscuits . the salmon was actually salmon chunks not the raw traditional smoked salmon and it was grilled fresh. definitely recommend trying this place out !
very good for a weekend brunch! the bloody mary was spot on. will definitely be going back soon!
very friendly and great staff. one of the best bloody mary bars ive seen and very good breakfast. would definitely recommend it to anyone
tried this place while on a staycation in scottsdale. food was delicious! i had the chorizo and mushroom hash with a biscuit on the side. eggs on top were cooked perfectly. french press coffee was sooooo good and a definite must try. staff was great and super attentive and nice. the bloody mary bar looked great and such a cool concept when you want to build your own bloody mary. overall great place for breakfast and lunch.
after reading the reviews, i thought id try their breakfast.  im so happy that i did. i had the nutella and banana french toast along with a side of their potatoes.  i highly recommend both.  the french toast 4 big slices of bread with nutella and bananas in the middle. the portion was a good size. the potatoes had carmelized chopped onions and red peppers. they were delicious. the service was good and the food was more than i expected. im happy i gave this place a try!
i am definitely a fan of this place.  found it on yelp and i was surprised that this place was not more busy when i had arrived.  it apparently used to be cuttlefish, but the inside was very modern with white marble and the staff was very friendly.  my lady and i sat at the bar and was pleased to see there was a dj there keep in mind this was at 11am in the morning.  the dj created a very nice atmosphere and again i was just surprised there was no insane wait for brunch like i feel like all of scottsdale always is.  the bartender was very friendly and was outgoing and struck up a conversation with us throughout the whole meal.  i got the chicken  waffles which were fantastic.  they were topped with fried leeks.  my girlfriend got the chicken hash which was absolutely fantastic.  i think first off the think youll notice is that they use boneless chicken which makes for the perfect chickentowaffle ratio.  also they make inhouse biscuits which are  delicious!  selfishly i hope they dont get too big bc i dont want to have to wait for great food, but i guess its hard to keep a lid on something this great!  definitely wanting to try again!cheers!
best breakfast place ive been to in a long time. comes with a must try bloody mary bar. stumbled on it on a sunday am, not a long wait and loved it. took some twenty somethings a couple weeks later and its officially the new favorite breakfast place. ryan our server was another reason it was great. terrific guy and excellent at his job
i love hash kitchen! its my favorite place for breakfast and trust me i take breakfast very seriously. every time i come here i cant decide between like 7 things. whatever i choose is delicious. im currently eating the coconut almond french toast and i think its safe to say im dead because this stuff is heaven. ask for ryan as your server he has top notch service.thank you!! see you next weekend :
amazing!!!!!! they accommodated our large loud group well. amazing food. great service. next time i come to town, i cant wait to come back. thank you from booktini. and bonnie is legit.
my book club came here and the service and food was excellent.  i truly enjoyed the atmosphere and the music was great. bonnie is the hostess with mostest.
i worked with erno to set up a farewell brunch for my book club retreat. he was absolutely awesome. he accommodated our party recommended a custom menu. the hash kitchen provided a reasonable price with 5 options to choose from. the restaurant accommodated our vegetarian and gluten free members with multiple options. the food was fantastic!!! i have never been a fan of bloody marys, but since they were included i tried them. amazing! the mix there is not like any other place i have tried. our server chris worked his tail off. he provided excellent customer service. we were a large loud group, and the hash accommodated us quickly and extremely well. i would recommend this place to anybody who wants great food, with great service. thank you from booktini.
my sister and i are here on vacation and we went to hogs and hops last night for dinner. linda, the general manager, recommended we come to the hash kitchen for breakfast this morning. these two restaurants have the same owners. after she described their chicken and waffles and bloody mary bar we knew we had to! this morning we came in and were greeted by linda immediately and joe the owner. wow that is some amazing customer service! the food was top notch and the chicken waffles definitely didnt disappoint!! this is a must stop for breakfast if youre in the area!
5 stars because my son loved  his breakfast sandwich!  everything we ordered was delicious from biscuits to corned beef hash to french toast. extensive menu. wanted to stay and try it all. it just kept getting better with super nice staff and great service. elaborate bloody mary bar. dj playing great upbeat music. happiness!
this place is fabulous! the service is great. everyone is so friendly. live music sets a chill atmosphere. the food is delicious. the bloody mary bar is a great touch. love,love, love.
found this restaurant in the current best of phoenix magazine. easy to get to location. friendly staff. french press coffee was delicious. the hash was excellent. i had the chrizo and mushrooms while my wife had herb chicken with fried leeks....the eggs were poached to perfection! we will be going back to try more selections and have already told our friends to check this place out.
this place is excellent for breakfast. i had the brisket corn bread hash; the brisket was apparently smoked for 12 hours, and it showed. the corn bread was sweet and the potatoes were savory. it was the best thing ive eaten in a long time. the coffee is very good. my wife had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which were sweet and light. id wholeheartedly recommend this place. they have two small outdoor patios that look like a nice place to eat breakfast. the atmosphere inside was a little formal for breakfast and the music was strange greatest hits of the 90s for some weird reason. but the staff made up for it with excellent service and the food was spectacular. ill be back for sure.
amazing experience! fun, relaxing and friendly place. lots of hash at our table, but i had the coconut encrusted french toast with caramelized bananas. yum! my friends said the hash was also highly pleasurable. the highlight was none other than the most exquisite bloody mary bar i have ever seen. ask about the secret door to the craft beer restaurantthanks to chris for a breakfast blast!
tried this cute spot for our weekly brunch with friends last sunday. great ambience bigger size than a lot of other local brunch spots that can get stuffy and overcrowded at busy rush times. the bloody mary bar has so many options for toppings, a bit intimidating for a first timer but the staff was very friendly and helpful. it turns out im an excellent bloody mary designer : the food was delicious we had the smoked salmon benedict, mexican chorizo omelet, biscuits and gravy and the breakfast burrito at our table everything was very tasty! the biscuits were sweet, buttery and flakey. i cant wait to go back and try the lump crab benedict next! its also nice that they have tvs with the games on so the boys dont rush us home :
top notch service friendly outgoing ,great decor elegant but inviting great bar and oh yes fantabulous chow .....
with a bloody mary bar worthy of a best of new times award, the hash kitchen is the brunch spot you need to hit up.  the lump crab sweet potato hash is the perfect balance of sweet and savory, and the staff is phenomenal.  chris was the most charismatic delightful server we have ever had!!
this was our first visit, and i cannot say enough about this place.  my husband was craving smoked brisket and eggs so he did a google search and found the hash kitchen.  he started with a berry memosa and i had a mocha coffee with a side shot of kaluhua to add as i drank it. it is incredibly delicious, not to mention the waitress gave me a generous amount of kaluhua in the shot. my husband had the smoked brisket, eggs over medium, hash potatoes and a side of pancakes. it was exactly what he was hoping it would be and so much more. the smoked brisket was bursting with flavor and came with a side of warm barbeque sauce that was sweet and tasty.  we shared the pancakes which were delicious as well. the reduced maple syrup is amazing!i had the lump crab eggs benedict. it is two perfectly poached eggs on a split biscuit covered in a bay hollandaise and a generous amount of crab. mine also included hash potatoes. the crab benedict was the best thing to grace my taste buds in a long time. the hollandaise sauce had flawless consistency and flavor that paired perfectly with the thick custardardy yolk of the eggs, and decadent richness of the crab. the potatoes are okay, but not as flavorful. the service was wonderful as well. our waitress,  sara, was very friendly and on point. we will definitely be back. in fact this may become our regular saturday morning breakfast hang out. there are many more items on the menu i cannot wait to try. i was going to take a photo of our plates, but i was so excited when the food came that i just dug right in and forgot all about the photo... lol
the food was on point and the service was stellar. rachel made recommendations, kept our drinks full and took care of absolutely everything! all around great experience, we will be back.
great new breakfast place. the food was excellent. service in spite  of being full and busy was fast. linda the manager is hands on and checked on us to make sure we were taken care of. ambience is perfect.
this place is amazing !!! great food !!! great service !!!! the best place to eat in scottsdale!!!!
bloody mary bar is amazing and dont miss the sweet potato lump crab meat hash.   yum!!!
great food, great service, great atmosphere! a dj in the lobby! bloody bar, wslim jims for condiments and more! jessie at the bar is great too!
new favorite......i love when you find a breakfast place with something different and unique.  there are so many options and i love that you get a biscuit with your scrambles. the biscuits are really good and a nice change from toast.  i also like that you can chose items to put in your scrambles. the eggs and veggies in my scramble were fresh and cooked perfect. little cup of their potatoes that comes with it had good flavor. the service was fast and our waiter was great. i went with my mother and we both really liked the music in the background.  fun, upbeat atmosphere, which may be the reason we just had to have a bloody mary!  we  had the house one, which was really good!  next time will be more daring and try the bloody mary bar.  cant wait to take my out of town guest here next week.
such a great experience. everything was so yummy and the portions were great. my boyfriend has a big appetite so we often like places but the only problem is is my boyfriend still leaves hungry.... not with this place. we ordered food and kind of shared everything and not one of the things we ordered was not not good. i had the biscuits and gravy and parfait and he had the smoked salmon hash with the bloody mary. speaking of, they have a build your own bloody mary bar which was amazing. they had like 4 different kinds of beef jerky alone to choose from. loving beef jerky it instantly had my approval. we will definitely return!
the hash kitchen is awesome.  the food is delicious, the service is outstanding, the bloody mary bar is crazygood!  we stopped here on a whim on thanksgiving morning as we had arrived via a very early flight from colorado.  thank goodness they were open!  we were absolutely delighted with the entire experience.  we wouldve loved to come back during our visit to az, but unfortunately our schedule would not allow it!  these photos of our food just dont do it justice!  cant wait to come back in a future visit!
great place, dog friendly patio, attentive wait staff.food here is very good! try the coconut and almond encrusted french toast.
it was a great restaurant for brunch we had really good service jessie was awesome our server.  linda the general manager is awesome.  the coffee is high quality and the chilaquiles are great
went here again on sunday for brunch. was not disappointed. the reason i originally gave it 45 stars was because the music was a little clubby and loud for my taste. however, this time they were jammin the reggae and it was not nearly as loud. well done!
amazing build your own bloody mary bar! any type of hash is awesome. run...dont walk... to try it. sunday morning early before the crowd gets there!!!!
my new favorite breakfastbrunch spot in scottsdale. the atmosphere and decor is comfortable  fun. they have a bloody mary bar, which im sure is very popular. the coffee was bold and wonderful! i had the coconutalmond french toast and good god was it sent from heaven! he had the lemon ricotta pancakes which sounded scary but was amazinggggggg!!! the best part was the friendly and attentive staff..service was prompt and bonni, the hostess made us feel like old friends. she was seriously the cutest thing everrrrr...to the owner, joe...i literally cannot wait to come back this weekend to experience the weekend vibe! great job guys!!!!
decided to check this place out while on a business trip in scottsdale. based on the reviews we gave it a shot. well worth it with great service and food. tried the corned beef hash and it was one of the best ive had. french press coffee was a nice touch also... would recommend to everyone in the scottsdale area.
i highly recommend the lump crab bennies! they are perfect!  the corn beef hash was also delicious!
top notch service friendly outgoing ,great decor elegant but inviting great bar and oh yes fantabulous chow .....
omg hands down best service, everytime go in and ask for chris the best most handsome waiter . hes on it. we come.here for him and the amazing food and atmosphere . chris is the most personable attaintive go getter. love hash thanks chris for introducing it us
being from out of town; i saw the high ratings and decided to drive 35 minutes to have breakfast here. im so glad i did! the service was exceptional. the ambiance was nice and beautiful, cute blood mary bar if you like. not my kinda thing. we came on a friday around 10:30am and were seated immediately. the prices was reasonable all staff was very friendly, will definitely come back. especially for the lump crab benedict and the chicken and waffles. my gf had the croque madame and was in love with that. no complaints at all, similarly reminds me of hash house in sd and vegas, but the prices is lower and the quantity was gods, they didnt tower the whole plate with too much. thank you guys, ill be back next time im in az!
delicious restaurant! the decor is perfect and the food is too. healthy and filling! i recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great time. i shall be back!
do not miss this little gem on the desert. tucked away near the desert foothills theater and ymca, the food is spectacular and more than a soup or sandwich. think five star restaurant in a little bistro. breakfast and lunch service. unique and quality ingredients, friendly staff and cute, casual location
i would like to take a moment to say farewell to all of the other breakfast burritos in az. we had some good times and i will treasure the memories, but ive found a new love. her name is my sweet blessings classic breakfast burrito.  they have amazing baked goods. the employees were extremely friendly, and the service was very prompt. we just found our new favorite breakfast spot.
i am so happy this restaurant moved so close to us, we can ride our bikes in and have the best breakfast burrito of my life.  not only is the food perfect but the family that owns the restraunt is extremely kind and friendly.
truely uniguely amazing food.  from sandwiches to desserts once you go, youll keep going back.
great celebration of local brew talents! beer was good and the crowd was easy to manage through.
i met the pat on the back gang 4 years ago when my company brought them in for employee recognition.  the chair massages were fantastic!  since that time, i regularly have massages in my home.  i have also enjoyed couples massages.  pat on the back is exceptional!  i will not have a massage done by anyone else now. they are always prompt, professional, and it is so nice to have such great people come into my home.  i have never had better massages than with them.  there are a lot of individuals and companies out there doing massage.  these folks are the absolute best!
i met the pat on the back potb team at an employee appreciation function at my employer.  after experiencing a chair massage, i purchased a couples massage and set about making the inmyhome massage a special surprise.  i cannot say enough great things about the potb staff.  they went out of their way to make sure i was pleased and that my surprise was just that. they followed up with multiple calls, arrived precisely on time, managed the interaction with the utmost of professionalism and made the entire event a true blessing.  patrick and angela  my deepest appreciation for your care, support and attention to detail during your visit.  i am extremely grateful to you both and am thankful for all that you did.potb is exceptional!  i would strongly recommend them to anyone wanting convenience, professional and knowledgeable staff and a wonderful massage!
i had the pleasure of receiving a massage from angela of pat on the back. she was a delight, friendly, professional and caring. i thoroughly enjoyed her style of massage. i personally like relaxing massages and she provided just that, it was just what i needed. i highly recommend angela. im confident she can provide whatever you are looking for in a massage.
i was introduced to patrick and angela at a work appreciation event. these guys are awesome! patrick and angela are very professional, friendly, caring and of course they give a dynamite massage. they come out to your house, event or function and set up their massage table or chair massage seat in a flash. the only bad thing is that all good things have to come to an end . i get massages quite frequently and they are hands down some of the best in the business and i am not always easy to please. so if you want or need a great and professional massage with no funny business give these guys a call or book online. enjoy !
pat on the back is a great business run by wonderful people, but to the casual observer that wont matter much. if you have come into contact with pat on the back, its probably from some group event or other largescale ondemand chair massage encounter. thats when you will notice how really good this business is. they do accept appointments for a relaxing spa experience. all therapists are apparently  certified and licensed. this is a great addition to your vacation experience or if you are local just a great way to relax and improve the quality of your life. the quality is strong, the value proposition is strong, the experience is great. take your time and do it right. life is to short to be stressed out!i would like to recognize patrick and angela who remembered me from the sporadic contact we have had over the years. its always a great experience with pat on the back! ask about discounts and specials!
these guys are amazing!  theyve been to my employer several times to give us all chair massages.  they bring soothing music, foot massagers and their signature umbrella.  the massage therapists are the most awesome, nicest people you ever want to meet, and they do a great job with the massages.  be sure to check out their website because they have great rates!
its rare for me to yelp something other than food, but this is so necessary. the folks at pat on the back are so awesome they deserved a yelp! they have been out to my job several times and i must admit i sneak away from my desk to find them in the building!! the massages are about 15 minutes of pure delightfulness and the foot massage thingamobobber leaves you feeling like your walking on clouds! i strongly suggest you head over to their website to check them out you wont regret it!!
my father came to visit me from italy and had a massage from pat. im writing the review for him because my father does not speak english. all i can say is that my dad dreams about that massage every day and he wants to come back to vegas soon not for me but to get another massage from pat, and that is quite a long trip.... seriously the massage was incredible, if you already live here it is a no brainer, call them you wont regret it. im not a massage person but because of my dad experience i will get one soon.
the best frozen yogurt in the valley. love this new location on the s.e. corner of ray rd. and higley. close to agritopia, and top golf. friendly staff great tasting frozen yogurt.
this is a great frozen yogurt spot in gilbert that is really close to where i currently live.  i really enjoyed their sea salt caramel and their cake batter flavor.  im hoping they get an oatmeal cookie flavor as well.  the topping bar here is better than any place ive been too.  its in the middle and theres plenty of room to get around.
came here with my wife and daughters. very impressed by the cleanliness, choice of flavors and numerous fresh toppings available. perfect treat for a hot august afternoon! by far my favorite frozen yogurt spot.
great location. wide variety of flavors. creative with names. you can help yourself to taster cups, we found that really nice. reasonably priced. we will return....soon :
who doesnt love some good ole froyo!? this place always hits the right spot. they always have solid flavors, and it is always clean. staff is always on point as well. sign up for the point system, you get 5 after you hit 50 points, which isnt that hard if youre a fatty like me. also, 50 off if you go in your pajamas on wed nights. come on....froyo and pajamas...thats living!
always awesome. they have great flavors with plenty of toppings. good place to kick back and have dessert.
found over 400 worth of clothes for about 150! i have found my new favorite store! :
katie has been our doctor for several years now. we are so excited that she now has a hospital closer to where we live. always pleasant and professional is the team here at the sarival hospital.
sarival animal hospital provides the best care to our little ginger. i have had many pets before, and dealt with many veterinarians, but none as wonderful and caring as sah. the staff is always in such a great mood and willing to help out in any way they can! my personal favorite is dr. katie! she is so attentive and deals with my 1,000 phone calls with my 1,000 questions and never gets annoyed! they truly make you feel special by remembering you and your pet when you walk in the door. you will feel like you are part of the family!
so impressed with the service from this hospital!! everybody from the front desk attendant, to the veterinarian treated me and my sick dog with such care. its so refreshing to feel the compassion around you during hard times. my little fiona is doing much better and seems to have fought off her parasite but i am so relieved that they are just a phone call away should i have any questions. definitely recommend them! their prices are reasonable, and everybody seemed to love their job including the groomer!
i have been dragging my feet finding a new vet for my canine kid. i decided to go ahead and make an appointment at the newly opened office by frys. from the time i called in to make the appointment through the call i received the next day to check in and see how things were going i experienced nothing but friendly, caring professionalism. the office was clean and comfortable and i really, really liked dr. riehle. she was great with my dog and made sure to answer all of my questions. i also received 12 off my exam fee since it was my first time in. i will definitely return.

im rating this as an event venue. ive been here for two different events. and both were very different event types. one was a dinner and country entertainer. the tickets were a good value for the meal. it was a buffet style meal that included many options. the food was fresh and hot. not like it had been sitting around for a while. the entertainment turned out to be wonderful. all in all, it was a great evening. the second event was a private party. the staff was on top of the set up and maintained everything thru out the evening. appetizers were served that appealed to both the adults and kids. we had the entire place and it was very nice to be able to be outside on the patio. its a pretty location for an event.
a in home cage free enviorment. she takes her time even with difficult and tough dogs. always reliable and thorough. she has a passion for animals and involved in rescue. does everything from flea and tick baths to simple nail trimmings
clean, attentive, and safe enviroment for all dogs! amazing skills and very attentive to the wants and needs of customers and animals. this lovely lady is always expanding and learning new styles and care for her animals. wouldnt take my fur baby anywhere else
we have been taking our great dane to ashley for a while now and we couldnt be happier with the work she does! ashley is by far the best person i have ever met with dogs and i have never felt so safe and comfortable leaving our dog with her. our dog always comes back home looking and smelling fresher than ever for weeks! recommend her to every dog owner i know!!
my groomer moved which sucks it always sucks. i was able to book an appointment for the next day which is always amazing prices are super inexpensive compared to salons or pets mart and petco. i would highly recommend ashley  she gave me exactly what i had explained to her and beyond! i would definitely pay way more for this service than she charges. his nailed are perfect!  they arent sharp and they are cut down. picking up my dog he wasnt shaking or scared and trembling he was happy and excited he is no longer a smelly pooch he is fresh and so clean!! thank you ashley for the great experience i will definitely be using you from now on
we have been taking our great dane to ashley for a while now and we couldnt be happier with the work she does! ashley is by far the best person i have ever met with dogs and i have never felt so safe and comfortable leaving our dog with her. our dog always comes back home looking and smelling fresher than ever for weeks! recommend her to every dog owner i know!!
was looking for a qualified, but personal, groomer after a couple bad experiences. ashley definitely fits the bill! she is very well educated on dogs, super sweet, and has incredible prices. i will never take my back to the big box stores again! very quick response time and takes the extra few minutes to really understand what you want for your furry friend. she does pretty much anything and everything in daycare and grooming, even nail painting! also good to know that it is cagefree, so my baby isnt locked up all day. highly recommended!
we brought our handsome little guy thunder to be groomed for the first time and i cant express enough how happy we are. miss ashley did such a fantastic job. he is so pretty we found our new permanent groomer. her prices wow! amazingly reasonable. ..thank you ashley
weve used ashley for dog boarding and grooming on several occasions.  i cant say enough about the quality of care our dog has received!  weve left leo sometimes for over 3 weeks at a time and hes been so happy coming home.  and every time we drop him off he runs to the door bc hes so excited to go to ashleys.  thank you ashley for making leo feel so at home!  its such a relief to know that leo is in good hands when were out of town.
ashley does a wonderful job with grooming my little bella 14 year old shih tzu.  she takes great care with bella since she is older and is very flexible with appointments.  i recommend her grooming services.
best kids and adults class in arizona taught by brazilian jiu jitsu black belt shannon ritch
ive trained with several ju jitsu coaches and have to say that shannon is by far the best. his approach to the art is not only professional, but incredibly enthusiastic. his love and passion for the sport is obvious and infectious.shannon is incredibly patient, which is great because it takes time to learn this stuff. his approach is to explain, demonstrate then observe and correct. his classes build on previous learnings, so the flow continues through your training.additionally, shannon is just an all around great guy. funny as heck and great to be around. zero pretensions unlike a lot of the coaches around the valley.highly recommend!
as an after thought, id like to add that i appreciate shannons dedication to no bullies and the work he does to end bullying. i appreciate his dedication to ensuring that his students use their skills for positive purposes only.
my kids have trained with many jujitsu coaches and shannon is by far the best coach! he is so patient and kind with all his students. shannon gets down on the kids level and helps them to understand the art and science behind jujitsu. the kids cant wait to train everyday as they learn so much from him. he helps the kids to understand that bullying will and should not be tolerated. shannon the cannon is so committed to his students that its not uncommon for him to set up private lessons for those interested in one on one training.
we absolutely love this place and coach shannon is amazing. hes the real deal.  both my husband and son take lessons here. coach is great with the kids. every one always claims my son has no concentration, not in his class.  he is 110 focused here.  my daughter has also taken private lessons with him and has learned a lot in just a short time. this is a great place and our whole family recommends it for adults and children.
tints by mj is high quality shop.  these guys have proven their abilities time and time again.  i am a picky customer and these guys have exceeded my standards.  i have seen their quality of work, and they never fail to amaze me.  the price is reasonable and their quality is superb.  i have some fun sports cars, and these cars never go to the car wash for fear of someone mistreating my car.  this shop handled our challenger skat pack and our new mustang gt.  i fully trust this facility and staff to workdrive and personalize my car.  i cannot say that for other shops.  i have left other locations when i saw how they drove and parked their customers cars....well mike and his crew babied my cars as much as i do.  quality work, superb product happy customer!
great experience and a fair price. i work all week and i was close by so mj came and got my car and dropped it off in a timely manner. tint looks great and i got a lifetime warranty which is awesome. thanks for the great work, mj!
i was very happy with the wrap that tintz by mj did on my car!  it is truly original and i get complements on it all the time!
i priced a few tinters from yelp and was surprised by the variance in prices. one shop was 60 higher...with a groupon! to make it interesting,they had to remove old tint from a rear window with an old defroster in a conv. they also offered a very favorable price to remove the illegal tint on my wifes avalanche. while they had her pu, they also did a small fix on it. i think her asking hot blond may have helped tho. kidding aside, very happy with the service. check prices before doing anything and record all verbal quotes. i think youll be satisfied with these gentlemen.
mike and his crew did a great job. would recommend them anytime..
i love tru yoga!  the atmosphere is clean, relaxing, and the the rooms are perfectly lit.  there are 2 bathrooms to use and are always kept clean and smell nice.  :  there is one bigger room and then a smaller room for classes.  it just depends on how many people are attending the class.  i have taken classes from shelly, jenn, abhaya, and ashley, and they are all wonderful!  their website is always up to date with the current teachers, as well as subs and a detailed description of the yoga class style.  the front desk lady dont know her name, but she checks me in every time...woops! is always cheerful, friendly, and quick.  the teachers are very friendly and are willing to accommodate and assist all levels of students in a welcoming manner.  i can always count on getting a decent workout, as well as feeling calm and centered when taking a class here.
i absolutely love this studio!  i am fairly new to practicing yoga, and everyone instructors and yogis is super welcoming and very kind.  i leave each class feeling very relaxed, rejuvenated, accomplished, and overall, feeling amazing!  i have taken classes with ashley, jaimee, autumn, jo, kelly, and janessa and all of them are amazing!  i really like how they correct my form or offer modifications if there is a certain pose i just cant do yet!.  there is no judging in class, which i love... i just always feel so welcome every time i come in.the rooms are spacious and clean, and perfectly lit for a relaxing session.  i go back and forth, depending on my mood, between quiet bliss restorative yoga  absolutely blissful and so chill!, rock my body, soothe my soul challenging, but im already reaping the benefits!, and breath of fresh air perfect for a beginner yogi.  ive only been practicing for a couple months and i feel stronger, more flexible, and definitely not as stressed!i am so glad i found this studio... bonus points that i live only a mile away!  try this studio out... you wont regret it!
great studio! the manager was lovely, she seemed very concerned about ones experience. the studio is nice, simple and clean. i dont need a huge locker room, shower and dressing rooms... its about the yoga, the practice and the community.my only con was that it was a little cramped during a workshop. the pro in that was i got to know my neighbors :
i love this show.  im so glad they moved to planet hollywood.  this is the best showgirls show in vegas.  first, the dancers are beautiful and really talented.  its clear they have grown up as dancers, because they are so physically perfect and so fluid and accurate in their moves.  you can see on their faces that they love dancing.  and the entire show is really a celebration of the female form and sexuality.  also, the choreography is terrific and well thoughtout.  everything in the show flows beautifully, and its like a really nice, long, sensual dream.  every time the show ends, i just think about seeing it again someday.  everyone involved in producing this show should be proud of their accomplishment... the best showgirl show in vegas possibly the world.  see it early on in your trip, so that youll have the option of seeing it again.  honestly, this is always the highlight of my visit to vegas.
i was reluctant to go with all the negative reviews at previous venues, but the crazy girls show at planet hollywood was grade a amazing! my wife and i loved every second. the girls were all very attractive, talented, and appeared to be enjoying themselves. i would go again, and that is saying a lot!
i saw the show the other night and it was great! i saw the famous butts statue on the casino floor and rubbed the derrieres for good luck. the shows stars are the seven provocative crazy girls who even come down into the audiences. the fiveminute video intro is well done and gets you ready for a good show. the cocktail waitress we had was one of the nicest ive ever met. you can actually get a souvenir program and photo with the crazy girls after the show for only 20. the show is high quality and i guess thats why its been around for almost 28 years. we bought our tickets thru ticketmaster.com. if youre in the mood for some adult entertainment try crazy girls. the valet said full but when i said we were going to crazy girls the valet guy took our car. most of the other topless reviews are too late for us while crazy girls is at 9 pm
margit is tucked away on the far east side on the 2nd floor of a building housing macayo corporate offices. she shares space with a counseling office. i discovered her thanks to a groupon gifted to me and enjoyed it so much i bought my own and one for a friend! the pressure was perfect and she did a great job focusing on my expressed needs on each visit. the thing is: her pricing is super reasonable and you really dont even need a groupon to make a massage fit in the budget! i also love the fact that she has appointments on saturday and sunday!
i found margit through groupon. its been awhile since i have gotten a massage and cant believe ive waited so long. all i know is i wont wait so long for the next one and will be going back to margit!!  she knows what she is doing and very good at.  i would defiantly recommend if you have never gotten a massage or if its been awhile to go and visit her!
margit has a very relaxing environment.  i feel like all my stress and soreness leaves me after my treatments.  she is very good at what she does.  i love her deep tissue messages and appreciate her facial and cranial messages which have helped my nerve pain a lot.  last but not least margit is an extra nice caring person and loves helping people.  although you dont have to have pain to get a great message!
i have seen many massage therapist in 30 years, margit is excellent . i have a disability and she works well with my condition, i have been seeing her once or twice a month. for over 2 years now, without her knowledge of the body in mind.  i would be living a life with out some relief of my daily pain. i highly recommend you se her,  margit thank you for helping us feel special.
addicted..... love, love, love this location. i was a big fan of my pb studio in redondo beach and missed it so much when i moved to az. i was delighted to hear a new nosco location was opening. veronica is seriously the best, so nice and personable i have no idea how she remembers everyones name. you are always greeted by a warm smiling face. abby is a fabulous instructor and makes you push a little harder than you thought you could. the team here is awesome and im so excited to ltb with them.
if youre looking to tone like you never have before, pure barre is for you! my body completely changed after committing to this workout  ive never been so lean! i did pure barre intensively before my wedding and have started up again just two months after having my first child!the teachers continue to find new ways to challenge us and make the studio a welcoming environment. pure barre is more than a place to workout, but a community of positive and inspiring people!
love pure barre and love this studio! all the instructors and employees are so friendly and fun! each class is different so you never get bored and its tough and exiting every class. i have seen such a difference since i started pure barre and when i cant go due to work or other commitments i am so disappointed. i recommend pure barre to everyone and it really is addictive!
i have only just begun my experience with pure barre.  i feel like i am stronger each time. i look forward to seeing the positive change in my body!! all the staff at pure barre north scottsdale are very friendly and informative!!!
i just started my pure barre journey, and took my very first class at this studio a week ago. the class was taught by one of the ownersa huge plus for meand it was challenging and a lot of fun. the studio is super cute and calming and i love that they always have candles burning. a lot of personal touches throughout the space. the staff members are really sweet and genuine. i was very nervous to take this well known tough class, and the intimidated feeling i walked in with dissipated immediately after being introduced to everyone. i have taken 7 classes in 8 days, and never once have i left the studio without someone saying good job and saying goodbye. they always remember my name. i have been to three out of the 4 studios the weyand sisters own, and its clear that their sweet personalities set the tone for each of their locations. its trueyour vibe attracts your tribe, and now im addicted.
embarrassingly, i found this place on my way to lunch at... panda express.  as i was eating my delicious, greasy bowl of fried rice, i made a promise to myself to come back later that day and take a pure barre class.  and, im happy to say thats exactly what i did and it was a great decision!if you have never done barre before, like myself, prepare yourself for full body soreness. every muscle in my body ached for the next three days, even though i consider myself a moderately fit person.  barre class will find all those little muscles that dont usually get worked out and push you to use all of them.  i always track my heart rate by using a chest strap whenever i work out in order to collect data on how intensely my body is working or not.  i didnt expect much from the small movement barre philosophy, but im happy to say that my heart rate and calories burned were on par with a rigorous spin class.  all in all, i loved my experience here and cant wait to go back next time im in the area.
love love love it! best teri burger ive had since moving from cali. ill be back a lot!!!!
i usually go for burgers at carls jr , five guys, or places like that but after eating here, im hooked!  the teriyaki burger was juicy and flavorful. they use really good meat!  my only wish was that it had a grilled pineapple, so i told the manager and they are looking into it!  next time ill try the wings!  they just opened so i understand that they may not be up to speed yet, but that will get better in no time.  2 thumbs up, 5 stars, 10 spoons, and all that!
such a good homemade burger place! i dont do mcdonalds or those fast food burger places kause its way too processed tasting! but burger factory does not at all taste processed!! on top of the flavor of the food..the service is not commercial!! its so personable..like youre at your friends house getting a burger!!
we have used coyote plumbing for approximately a year.  they are fantastic!  we have what some would consider high expectations of great service at a reasonable price.  they have delivered over and over again.  cory is always on time, professional, does a great job and is willing to go the extra mile.  cant say enough good things about them!
i have needed coyote plumbings services twice in the last month for my new startup business. first i needed them to cut back all the pipes from the hair washing stations that used to be here. then i needed an emergency patch when i accidentally drilled into an active line. both times the techs were on time, courteous, professional, and affordable. they explained exactly what they were doing and why, which i really appreciated. i will definitely call them first for any plumbing services i need. thanks, guys!
what can i say about rolling fusion,  but ive been extremely impressed with the food that this gourmet truck has been putting out. honestly for the price these tacos are pretty amazing plenty of food 3 tacos for 9 bucks with everything being made fresh with fresh ingredients all made to order with finesse and care.  my personal favorites are the ahi tuna which is alway fresh, light and flavorful.   i love the garnish of the thinly sliced succulent jalapeno on top to give it that bite of heat to set off all the other flavors.  the second favorite is the pork belly tacos yes.. pork belly.   this glorified bacon is cooked to perfection with a crispy crust almost comparable to a chicharon with a nice meaty delicious mouth watering interior.  the eggplant kimchee does the trick of bringing out these amazing complexity of flavors making you wish there were more than 3 in an order   hey im a big guy so if you are hungry, and want some mind blowing tacos, and you can find them...dont miss out rolling fusion they are amazing!
i love rolling fusion! my favorite is the fish taco! i love the combination of the crunchy fish, that tastes so fresh.  the avocado cream and sun dried tomato spread is delicious and smooth. the slaw is flavorful and adds an amazing texture. the jalapeno slice adds the perfect amount of heat!  i normally do not like tongue, but the great chefs of rolling fusion have made me a fan!

i dont think ive ever given a place 5 stars but the location, atmosphere and food were perfect for our sunny day trip to montreal. we were quickly seated as requested outside in the shade. the water was delicious and the staff quite friendly and punctual. i ordered a bacon cheese burger which was accompanied by a delicious salad. the burger itself was perfectly cooked and seasoned. something many places have trouble doing. it was one of those meals that leaves you satisfied but not full. definitely worth a return trip
on a recent trip to montreal with a group of friends, i was searching the web and yelp for a good place to eat close to my hotel that was not asian and i happened upon cafe du nouveau monde.  when i saw that one of their featured cocktails was my favorite negroni, my decision was made toute suite.seeing that the cafe is in the same building as the theatre du nouveau monde and that i arrived about 20 minutes before curtain, i was very pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately, albeit at a smallish table for two, but just right for a single diner.the cafe was in high gear with theatregoers, but my server attended to my desire for a negroni as soon as i had the menu in my hand.  the drink was delivered in no time flat, and my oh my, it was as good as if i had made it myself.  i shared that information with my server while ordering my meal, and was paid a visit by the bartender shortly thereafter for a nice conversation about proper balance and craft cocktails in general.  a very nice and knowledgable lady.  when i ordered a second one, it was just as perfectly made as the first.my food was exceptionally good from entree sauteed mushrooms on crostini to main grilled pork chop, a special to dessert affogato, served properly with grappa and a shot of espresso on the side.the cafe pretty much cleared out at curtain time, but it wasnt long before more people showed up to keep the place lively.  and while i did have a main server, others on the friendly and attractive wait staff had no problem checking in on me and i certainly enjoyed practicing my conversational french with them.i returned twice during my week in montreal, once for lunch with a couple of friends warm octopus salad for me, very good and for another single dinner sauteed shrimp entree, roasted scallop main and white chocolate cheese cake dessert, all delicious later the same day.  and yes, more negronis at dinner, each as good as the very first.i would have loved to return to cafe du nouveau monde again, but it being my last night in montreal, it was made memorable by the food, the negronis, the great bartender and wait staff.a la prochaine, cafe du nouveau monde!
talk about luxury! this place spares no expense on the atmosphere they have created! a modern day disneyland for adults and kids! from the pool to the media room to the countless bedrooms this a a top destination to visit on your next stay in arizona! this house was even rented out for the last super bowl by bono himself! its location is second to none right in the heart of tempe near the campus and minutes from scottsdale and downtown phoenix! the cleaning crew comes once a week and the kitchen staff are world renowned! i can honestly say this a place to come and relax and party whatever might be on the menu for that night!
a man once said, casa de smith has it all! but then he was promptly arrested, and prosecuted to the full extent of the law for uttering the biggest understatement in american history.lets start with great tenants, whose familyfirst, party also first mentality is better than average.  endless house amenities include, but are not limited to, a popcorn machine, media room, basement, basketball hoop, pool, pool table, hot tub, hot girls, cute dog, ugly dog and even a hummer golf cart.  did i mention the freshly cut, lush green grass in the front yard? its gotta be the most inviting residence in the great municipality that is tempe, arizona.whether its watching football with some buddies and sipping adult beverages or throwing wide gatherings with loud music in their party basement, casa de smith is a place that most anyoneoutside of the tempe city council and immediate neighbors could feel welcome, and enjoy their time while there. man, love this place!
wow, what can i say about this place.... amazing, wonderful, yugggeeee, comfy and friendly. great hospitality, 5 stars
there are so many different type enchiladas to choose from  all freshly prepared. the enchiladas verde were excellent and will always be my first choice.  you could taste the fresh ingredients.
so many enchiladas to choose from. we each had a different one and both were amazing! the portions are large, and try to save some room for the churro dessert, so good!  would most definitely recommend this place.
found this restaurant on a whim. we dont go out for mexican often, but when we do we have high expectations. this place was awesome. it had been open for 5 weeks when we were there and you can see the passion of this family. decor is fun and cute while still being high quality. place is clean and spacious. the beautiful owner tanya came out to say hello and make sure our meals were delicious. server was kind and gave us recommendations and checked back often. cant wait to come back and bring friends !  ps  wednesday all day is all you can eat .... come hungry and bring your family.   great find for a saturday night dinner.
a hidden gem for sure. the atmosphere and decor are authentic of mexican culture. very clean, very festive. their staff is very friendly and helpful. we ordered to go. i couldnt decide between the entomatadas or the enchiladas verdes so we got half and half, since the order comes with four enchiladas. while we waited i was served a sopa de fideo that was delish! their tortillas and sauces are handmade daily. was very pleased. will definitely come again.
enchiladas are some of the most diverse mexican foods there is.  las enchiladas de mama knows their stuff. they were cooked perfectly.  some places have chewy, hard, or undercooked sections of the enchilada; which takes away from the flavor, but not this place.  as great as the food was the service was fantastic and everything was done by hand no factory content. fresh as fresh can be.im not a big enchilada guy, but this place was excellent. they are new so i recommend stopping by and giving a new local business a shot at impressing you. i recommend the enchiladas verde wchicken and the entomatadas in a combo plate. they are awesome at letting you try a variety of their selection so you can enjoy the different flavors!great service, passionate cooks, and a comfortable atmosphere.
this is an amazing place with authentic mexican plates. they have an incredible variety of enchiladas and each one has a unique flavor. i live in california and there is no place there that can even compare to this restaurant. if you are looking for a place for truly gourmet mexican taste this is your place.
all their ingredients are freshthe tortillas are baked on site and very good. they give you great chips and salsa to start, and even a cup of some unknown but amazing little soup. plenty of comfortable places to sit with huge windows but the inside is still nice and shady. friendly staff. 5 stars.
this is my new favorite place! the enchiladas are out of this world! our plates came with fideo soup which was a nice bonus. as soon as i tasted it i said somebodys mama made this. you can taste the love in the food. i had 3 enchiladas: chile verde wchicken, mole wchicken and chile pequin w cheese. the pequin was hot but i love love love spicy food. it was incredible. the chef even came out and asked who had the pequin? i raised my hand with an empty plate in front of me. she was impressed, even bowed lol. not bad for a gringa! the beans and rice were spot on too. i usually need to add salt andor tapatio to my plate but everything was seasoned to perfection. cant wait to come back!!!!
awesome food, came to have dinner with my brothers and sisters at enchiladas de mama, homemade corn tortillas, good chile rellenos,  and great service
excellent quality food ,great service at a great price. the black beans and rice are perfectly prepared and the hand made tortillas were incredible.
i took my family to eat breakfast at this place this morning, and ive got to say that it was awesome!  i had the 1 special, that also came with a fideo soup, which was also amazing, so much so, that my son also ordered another bowl of it, after he ate his soft taco plate.  a must visit gem when in vegas for awesome enchiladas.
this new mexican restaurant gets 3 thumbs up from the three amigos.we tried this place tonight with a restaurant.com gift certificate in hand.when we walked in we were the only customers in this strip mall location.decor in this large establishment  is very mexican and maybe even a little on the tacky side with all the streamers  and the like in the air and on the walls.  i guess you could call it overly festive.  in all of our opinions it could use some toning down.they have only been open about 4 months and the specialty here is of course the enchiladas. our meal started with the typical chips and salsa.  chips were decent and salsa was chunky and a little kick.  we then had a great sopa de fideo.  a little salt  lime and the 3 of us finished our bowls. they offer about 9 or so different  amazing sauces and based on the 3 that we tried they were as good as you can get in this town. we tried the verdes, entomatadas  morita. see the pics of each.  when it comes to sauces they know what they are doing here and they are cooked to perfection  there are 3 price points starting at 9.95 for cheese or plain and then 11.95 for chicken or ground beef and finally 12.95 for beef or carnitas.  these are not your typical triple fold large tortilla enchiladas. they are  single taco size fold in half freshly made tortillas filled with your choice and smothered in sauce, queso  cream.  and you get 4 four now for a few dislikes from the gringo of the bunch.  the rice while just average had no flavor and was just too plain for a mexican rice.  also, they only offer black beans. this gringo does not like black beans.  right now they still have no liquor license which can be a killer for some mexican restaurants especially one as large as this.  we were told by our waiter who is the brother of the owner that they should have it by december 1st.we were told that on wednesdays they have all you can eat enchiladas, you pay for your first plate and then they will continue to bring you two at a time till your full.  they have a huge chalkboard full of lunch specials with all kinds of taco, quesadilla and the typical mexican combinations. for those hung up on pepsi as i am they only serve coke product here.we all wish this new find of ours a long life in this hard market and they will for sure see us again in the near future as they do have the best enchiladas in town.
not a typical mexican restaurant. they have a wide range of enchiladas with many great sauces to choose from. great and fast service!
the best enchiladas are here  look no further. this is a new place, just opened this summer  2015. with the exception of the mole sauce, all sauces are family recipes. the encachuatada and encremada are exceptional. very welcoming and friendly staff.
i decided to try this restaurant because it was near my doctors office, and it had great reviews. i was a little startled when i went in, and it was totally empty. i stayed anyway and am very glad that i did. it was delicious! it started off with chips and salsa. when i asked for hotter salsa, he was quick to bring me some. i had the enchiladas de chili verde with chicken. they were hot, hot, hot just the way i like it. my meal came with soup, four enchiladas, refried beans, and rice. the enchiladas werent rolled or flat which is the only way i have had them before. they are folded over like tacos. the beans were black refried beans and delicious. that was the first time i had refried beans that werent pinto. the plate was large and full of food. i couldnt come close to eating it all.they have the largest selection of enchilada sauces i have ever seen. of course, they have the standard options, but they also had sauces like pumpkin seed, black bean sauce, and japanese peanut. i just wish this place wasnt across town from me. i hope business picks up, so they can stay open. my only criticism is that i would have preferred the home made corn tortillas to have been a little thinner.
excellent customer service, very friendly staff, food is delicious the best enchiladas i ever had, i recommend this restaurant 100  and they have wed and sunday all you can eat enchiladas
i am glad we searched hard enough to find this gem. everything was so fresh and made after we ordered.  great service. they are new and werent very busy yet. i hope lots of people find them.
we were staying at the luxor casino and decided to eat some authentic mexican food and las enchiladas de mama hit the spot perfectly. ..the service was awesome and the food was perfect and the chile was excellent!!! the price was budget saving and gave us reason to return again before we leave las vegas. ..if youre looking for good mexican food this is the place especially if youre on a budget...i promise you wont be let down!!!!  by the way, they have all you can eat enchiladas sundays and wednesdays from  9am to 11pm...f.y.i.
las vegas has many options when it comes to mexican food. but if you really  like to enjoy true mexican gastronomy this is the perfect place to do it! the food was serve fresh and fast, the service that our waiter gustavo give us was outstanding. the place was very clean and nicely decorated. highly recommended and worth it to give yourself a chance a new wonderful taste.
isela has a bubbly personality and so sweet. great customer service and should definitely get promoted. never have a ever been to a fast food place and felt so welcomed.
totally stumbled upon this place by accident only to discover 20 flavors of ice cream! my husband and i eat got an ice cream, his was 2 scoops in a giant waffle cone, and it was less than 5 bucks and incredibly delicious. they also have pickles, water filling stations, bathroom tiles.. totally a bizarre one stop shop! cool little addition to the neighborhood, we will def be back!
very friendly owners and staff. always greeted when we come in. thrifty ice cream is simply the best and the cost is very reasonable. we love the alkaline water, which has so many benefits. the store is always very clean.  we actually enjoy going to get water, well the ice cream makes it even nicer!
i love this store and frequent it weekly. the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. i have all my friends and family going there for all their mystic needs.
i found this place walking past alberstons and when i stopped in i was blown away by how much stuff they have. the staff was really friendly and helpful, loved the music and atmosphere.
i live in north las vegas, but used to live by the store. i visited the store 3913 to buy a crystal. they had a decent selection and while i was there i found a book that i had been wanting to read. i could spend hours looking around, i just wish it was closer to my home in nlv. id recommend this place to anyone that is looking for anything holistic or mystic.
love love love this place!! everything in this store is awesome. they have everything from books to candles to crystals to jewelry. if they dont have what your looking for, they will be more than happy to find it for you and order it! the staff is amazing, i love them. they are so helpful!
ive visited all of the metaphysical shops in town and this one is by far my favorite. the staff and owner are honest good hearted people. they always answer all of my questions and if i ever ask for something they dont carry which rarely happens it will end up in the shop within a couple weeks. ive found other nice shops in town but the staff or vibes just didnt feel right. i only want to buy spiritual related things from people and places with good vibes and intentions. great people and great shop!
truly the best spiritual sanctuary one may seek. the atmosphere of this phenomenal store is fantastic and the employees very helpful. not to mention, the selection is the best i have seen in town and i have been to a lot. if you are seeking a place to calm your heart and mind, or a place to purchase candles, crystals, oracle or tarot cards, pendulums, crystal jewelry, or other spiritual tools, look no further. my only wish is that they open a place close to summerlin. since i have moved far north of henderson, i have regrettably not been able to come here as much as i would like. despite the 40 minute drive though, this place is definitely worth it! you will certainly not regret coming here. i know that neither i nor my friends ever did.
i buy a majority of my sparkly crystals and jewelry at for mystic minds.  the owner and her team are always very nice and super helpful.  this is a great place to pick up candles, cards, crystals, jewelry and to get readings.  go see mary rose...shes a fabulous, lovely lady!
amazing vibes, original products. fair pricing. i have only been in once but will defiantly return.
love this place. they have the best selection of crystals. they even have little id cards that describe each crystal and what theyre good for. it makes it really easy to buy them. the staff is always really friendly and welcoming.
love this place! awesome selection of crystals and very friendly and knowledgable staff. prices are very good also. love the dressed candles and the large variety of incense oils! would definitely recommend to family and friends!
so many crystals, incense, candles, books, herbs, and tons of jewelry. you could spend hours and hours in there and not see it all. the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. to top it off it always smells so good in there. lots and lots of parking.
this is definitely my go to place when i need a little soul time. everyone here is very friendly and helpful. its so peaceful inside and always smells great and relaxing. its a little hole in the wall place, so you might miss it, but everybody knows those are the best places.
first time at the crystal alley emporium, shannon helped me and was able to get everything i had on my list. i didnt really have time to look around but the store has a lot of stuff to look at. i will be coming back when i have more time.
great service. technicians went out of their way to explain all the repairs. free water, coffee, soda and wifi. i will back!
after replacing my front end suspension components on my early model ford expedition i took it to firestone to get it aligned. after countless times of bringing it back to make the steering straight again they made no difference. luckily this shop is located near my work and i decided to ask them if they could look at it. with no hesitation and a smile they were happy to do so. the employee took my vehicle in and did a inspection. he noticed that the toe adjustment was out and he fixed it, now my car doesnt pull to the left or right anymore! he didnt even charge me to look at it or fix the alignment that firestone couldnt get right. i will return for any work that needs to be done to my car that i cant do myself since they were truly honest! thanks honest1!
great shop! very comfortable atmosphere and knowledgable employees and technicians. i had an electrical problem repaired and four new tires put on and couldnt be happier. highly recommended!
ive had the pleasure to work with the team at honest1 a few times now and its always been a great experience. they do great work, and are quick to give me all options, including cheaper ones. the personal service here is unmatched. on one occasion, i needed to call into a work meeting. the owner let me use his conference room so i could take the call in peace. and afterward i found out he was on his own conference call during the same time in a separate location. i was so surprised to learn he put my needs above his. what a great service experience!
wow!  would never expect this to be here.  i grew up in cg and remember this as the beverage mart, which was a little run down.  the liquor factory is a hidden gem in cg that you must visit if you like or want to try good craft beers.  great selection, good sandwiches also.  nice bar and a few tables to sit at.  highly recommend giving this place a try!
a hidden gem with the best draft beer selection in the area. constantly rotating taps means there is always something new to try. fantastic service and knowledge on different beers. oh and the sandwiches? best value and quality in town with all boars head products. you cant beat it!
i took a chance today on a hole in the wall deli that opened 3 months back called bistro bar and deli in the liquor factory, located   930 e florence blvd in casa grande..i was looking for a deli that uses boars head products. i must say, the outside exterior leaves something to be desired, however the sandwich i ordered was amazing. much better than any you can get at subway, jimmy johns etc.  the family that owns it have been in the deli business from new jersey for 84 years. they will be adding hot sandwiches, potato and coleslaw salads in the near future. the prices are great! just a suggestion if you are looking for this type of venue close by. they feature wine and craft beers by the glass.
clean tattoo shop located inside the stratosphere. employees make you feel comfortable and artists are talented! i will return for more work!
this shop is awesome! leo is my artist and he is great! very knowledgable and friendly, and always does exactly what i ask for. i have been getting tattooed regularly for 14 years and leo is the only artist i will let touch my skin since i found him 5 years ago! the other artists are very welcoming and by the looks of their portfolios can execute any style of tattoo you can imagine. the shop is clean and bright and you dont get that too cool attitude like i have found in other tattoo shops i visited. i highly recommend ship and anchor tattoo! you wont be disappointed! thanks leo for always exceeding my expectations!
leo did a killer custom piece for me last year. great artist, great shop. the artists at ship  anchor are professional and welcoming.awesome experience  i will return for another next time im in town.
the best!!been going to leo for the past 4 years now. even though he is many states away. i no longer will let anyone else local work on me. ever year we go to vegas i stop in and get something new. not only is his work fantastic but hes extremely kind and patient. everyone at the shop is i highly recommend leo. see you next month my friend! staceynj
tattoo shop right on the strip with amazing artists. they have specialists in all types of tattooing and everybody seems well rounded. ive been tattooed twice there, once by davi soprano and once by leo villasenor. both are top notch and cool guys in general. i completely recommend this shop if youre a local or just visiting.
i love this shop i go there for all my tattoos and piercings. the staff is very nice and  friendly,professional environment. i highly recommend this shop to locals and tourists best prices best artists best work
davi and the crew are amazing artists. they are my go to shop. i actually fell asleep during my last tattoo on the inside of my arm. anytime im in vegas i have to stop and say hi. if i have the funds m, i get inked up as well. thanks for everything davi!!
jesse was my artist and he was very good. he understood the historical and emotional attachment i have with my original tattoo and he took great care to restore and preserve the history while enhancing and correcting it to give me the best possible tattoo. his line work is impeccable and i am so proud of my tattoo for the first time in a long time. thank you jesse and the rest of the crew for a great experience. i will definitely come back to get more art every time i visit vegas.
im happy to say that there is new sushi bar in town which has a great all you can eat option. luckily we were passing by on their first day of business so we decided to give it a try! i was originally just looking for some appetizers to snack on but the all you can eat dinner for 28.00 seemed pretty reasonable so i went with the all you can eat. i started with the kobe beef sushi roll. it had kobe beef, avocado and a sweet type of sauce drizzled on the top. it was delicious! the crispy buffalo shrimp was tangy . they were bite sized shrimp with buffalo flavoring. the 007 was like a california roll but with big pieces of shrimp and avocado draped over the rolls. i enjoyed these as well!bacon and scallop skewers were mostly bacon with tiny pieces of scallops inside. they had different skewers available . i would like to try the bacon and mushroom skewers next time. chicken katsu wraps were good especially for people like my husband who dont eat sushi. he was happy with the wrap and his cucumber salad .we ended the meal with some honey toast. it reminded me of hawaiian rolls with ice cream and honey on the top. it  was my first time having this dessert be prepared for sweetness overload!i liked the variety on the menu and that there wasnt a lot that was left out of the all you can eat. except for the sashimi but it was okay with me because i dont eat sashimi. i thought the picnic type of chairs were cute and comfortable. the service was on point and i cant wait to go back. my husband even found something he would like to try on our next visit!
this is the best all u can eat sushi restaurant i have ever went server are all nice and sushi and rolls r soo fresh and great u guys should try spicy tuna nacho and honey toast
this place is great! i am overly cautious of sushi places because of the raw fish but this place is clean and the sushi is excellent. its a small place and is decorated in true minimalist fashion. the service was excellent and the prices are competitive with other ayce places. the plum ice cream is excellent and not too sweet. the only thing is that if you need a place to sit with back support or are not fond of hard benches then youll have to sit at the sushi bar. definitely coming back.
im new to las vegas and a friend recommended this place. last night a friend and i decided to check it out, and it was one of the best sushi experiences ive had in awhile. the staff was beyond friendly and andy, the owner, was so delightful! we tried the white house roll, baked salmon, coco shrimp, softshell crab, poke tuna, and oysters. this menu was definitely worth it for the ayce price. the quality of the food was excellent, even better than most places in san diego! im definitely coming back here.
best sushi in town!its brand new and so worth a try. the chef special rolls are awesome, the service is great thanks sara and fantastic combinations keep coming...we will be back soon!
i am not a huge of fan of allyoucaneat sushi menus, but its very common in vegas.  however, i really enjoyed it here and would actually come back and do it again.  a friend and i checked this place out for the grand opening, and we really enjoyed the experience. thanks hanabi!  the restaurant has a sushi bar and modern bench style seating.  while hanabi is located in a shopping center, it reminded me of trendy hot spots youd find in bigger cities, which is cool to have in this area. the sushi was delicately and beautifully crafted i know because we sat at the sushi bar and watched into masterpieces that tasted as great as it looked. we were fortunate enough to see the owner, andy, work his magic on most of our orders.  you can order nearly everything offered on the menu, including poke salad, soft shell crab, and oysters.  i was most impressed by how fresh the food was  like so fresh, you can nearly taste the ocean where it came from.  because of the outstanding quality, i didnt feel like the rolls were heavy, but rather light and very satisfying.my only disappointment is that we didnt make it to dessert. honey toast, and allyoucaneat... i shall be back!
wow, better than expected, hanabi took the place of the 808 that was here, and i liked, but i was so surprised, and actually like hanabi better. better prices, more selection, excelent customer service. new, clean restrooms. everyone is so polite, so nice. we will be back, most definitely!!!!
if you love sushi, this is the place!!  if you love sake, this is the place!! the staff have been very upbeat and on point when it comes to customer service.  when you open your chopsticks and place the wrapper on the side of the table itll be gone before you even know it. chris has the most excellent customer service! first time here at hanabi, already fell in love
the food and service were magnificent.  they made us rolls that werent on the menu.  the blue fin from spain was unbelievable. the lamb ribs made japanese style was unreal. keep up the great food and service chef andy.
one of the best all u can eat sushi restaurant in town. food taste was really good and fresh. so many variety  of selections from sushi bar and kitchen.all of staff was well trained with polite manner.i personally love japanese food. and me n my wife always interesting to try new restaurants.this restaurant is something different from a common all u can eat sushi restaurant in neighborhood  u feel like u r in one of modern japanese restaurant in strip. very good atmospherei strongly recommend this hot new spot to person who want try fine dining experience in ur neighborhood!!!
i went with my family last night to try the restaurant for the first time and i must say i was really impressed! wide variety of menu to choose from even for ayce. everything was very fresh, delicious and nicely presented. i loved the atmosphere  very clean, modern and welcoming. i really liked the contemporary decor with the bench seatings, nice and fun huge blackboard on the wall they can utilize for house specials and allyoucaneat rules which btw the rules are the same as any other allyoucaneat sushi places. i didnt find it unwelcoming. the staff, especially the owner andy, was all so enthusiastic and pleasant. andy went above and beyond to make sure our dinner experience was to our satisfaction. another nice thing about hanabi was that they have cartoon channel up on 2 of their 4 tvs which my 7 year old son enjoyed watching while we took time enjoying the allyoucaneat to the fullest! normally he gets bored and ask to go home. he didnt this time and even said, food is good here lets come back! this will definitely be my familys designated ayce sushi restaurant whenever we crave sushi. so glad we found this place!!
first time here. the food and service was excellent. i had the sushi bento, and everything was delicious!
just had lunch at this new restaurant that took our other fave, 808 tapas... bummer they left, but this place exceeded my expectations. delicious food, friendly staff, and very clean!  now a new favorite place.
two words: cucumber salad.that dish alone was a work of art. if that 1 item was delicious, you know youre in for a treat for the rest of the menu :
this place is really nice! management even shook our hands and treated us like friends. my significant other loves the vegas roll. i love all the salmon! if youre near village square, its definitely a nice date spot!
items that lacked flavor: agedashi tofu  salmon cheese stick.  items that exceeded expectations: salmon poke, salmon roe nigiri, white house, crunchy rainbow, tuna  bluefin tuna. im not a fan of cajun albacore, but theirs was great. the fish is perfectly fresh. the service was perfect. chef andy has a great pedigree  took the time to chat at length about the food and his vision.
new local sushi place.  been here twice and it is easily the best all you can eat sushi place that i have found in vegas!  tons of options, both sushi and regular menu items.  the fish is very fresh and they show pride in their product!  the staff is really attentive and work well as a team to provide good service!as a side note, we really loved the crab salad that they use for their california rolls!highly highly recommended!
me and my wife are an avid fans of japanese food. she had lived in japan for over 25 years so she has been spoiled with amazing sushi. when she arrived in the u.s., she wanted to try some sushi here. we had found a couple of good but just above average japanese food since coming here. we decided to try out hanabi since it was close to the movie theater and we were in a hurry to catch a movie. we tried a couple of rolls and got out since the movie was about to start. needless to say, we went back to hanabi and tried the all you can eat. we brought my brother and sisterinlaw along with us from l.a. my wife was so delightfully amazed by their sushi. i myself was shock on how high the quality of fish they use. they are so fresh!!!  all we can say is amazing and delicious at the same time. i really cant recommend anything since all of the sushis and rolls were great. but if i have to choose a couple of items, i would go for the giant scallops and bluefin tuna. they are that good!  andy, who is the owner, is so friendly and attentive. i cant say anything negative about his restaurant nor his staff. jay, jun, jason and all the others were awesome. thank you guys for having us. it was a wonderful experience to eat at your restaurant. this will be our only japanese restaurant to go to. if they are close, we dare not to go elsewhere.  lastly, this restaurant is simply just short of being in japan. it is that good!!!!
i went to this place last night with my wife. brand new sushi restaurant. nice benches and tables. i liked the simple and modern atmosphere. cheves and servers are very kind and friendly. also the foods are great. we had all you can eat and the quality of fishes was the best . appitizers were yummy too. if you want ayce with the high quality fishes, visit this restaurant. you wont regret.
this brand new restaurants interior was so modern. servers were very pleasure and friendly. appetizers were so great. the sushi was so fresh. i cant believe they r using uncommon food such as toro, alaskan kingcrab, madai. i never seen those food in local restaurants. if you really like sushi, this place is no brainer.
i had to wait to taste the food here. all i can say is awesome. i looked over the menu  they do have an all you can eat for 28  22 for lunch. pretty good deal. you dont just have to have sushi you can also order beef, chicken  pork  of course, fish. andy the owner has worked  nobu  some other high end japanese restaurants. he has brought that quality, care  dare i say love, to his new restaurant. you can taste the freshness  quality. you can catch a ball game on any one of the many big screen televisions.

im so glad i found this place! its new in the area and my daughter and i found it by accident. we eat a lot of sushi and its close by. the place has an urban modern feel, everyone is very friendly and seems genuinely happy to see you! we ordered yellowtail sashimi. very fresh. we had a few different rolls, also very fresh and delicious. the service was fantastic so we decided to try the recommended desert of honey toast and it was unlike anything i have ever had. i will order it every time. there were many food and drink specials to choose from, we will make this one of our regular spots and look forward to exploring the entire menu.
one of the best run restaurants in vegas, no bullshit. the first thing i noticed walking in was andy, the executive chef, walking around to each table, making an effort to know each of his guests. the setting is very clean, and modern, yet nice to sit down and have a drink and some sushi whether youre by yourself or with friends. i tried a japanese stout which i didnt even know existed until i came here. it was so nuts i had to try and was not disappointed. the sushi was great. my favorite was the salmon roll which consisted of cooked salmon. i normally prefer the raw condition, but the sauce and tempura coating really pulled it all together. i also enjoyed the panko roll, which was nice and crisp but full of sushi goodness.all of the servers were on top of their game, friendly but not obnoxious. definitely coming back here frequently.
great food and a price that at first seems a little higher than most ayce places but once you see the variety of fish they offer justifies itself. i use do eat at ohjah and kobe as well as most other sushi west side places but this place replaced them all. got a custom roll and it was excellent. fish all tastes fresh.
this place has an awesome vibe and amazing food. i met the manager chris who took the time and made sure everything ran smoothly. he was very personable and i felt right at home. i will defenitley go back, especially for the buy one get one free saki!
the food was absolutely amazing. fresh tasting. we will be back. thank you jay our waiter excellent service. and most importantly to andy the owner that made sure we were satisfied......
this is an awesome new sushi spot. the fish is fresh and the staff is very welcoming. the interior has a modern feel to it. i defiantly recommend this place.
this place has amazing food, good prices, relaxing ambiance, great customer service and is by far the best sushi place ive been to in las vegas. the staff is so nice and they cater to you your requests. my wife and i have found our new spot. i will let everyone i know about this place. i highly recommend it to all.
went here for the first time after a bad experience at our regular sushi spot.. turned out to be a good change!! the restaurant was very nice and clean! prices are reasonable compared to where we used to go and i very much like that they have a childrens menu!! they offered a variety of sauces and had a nice selection of sushi!! the staff was very very nice!! thank you!! and please add low sodium soy sauce!!
animal, coco, red dragon and while house rolls were all awesome!! i am willing to drive across the valley for this place.
my girlfriend and i love this spot, soon as you walked in, it felt clean and cozy with plenty of lighting and fun little benches that were outside the usual chairs which gave the spot a lot more room than it seems. the staff and chefs were happy to greet you at first glance and say goodbye once you were all ready to leave. though they did have an all you can eat for a time limit deal, we opted in for single rolls as we werent as hungry to destroy as much after a movie and popcorn that hour prior. we started off with the 007 and loved it, fresh, creamy. then did something a little more spicy with our favorite ingrediant; avocado and what seemed like a tobascohot wing sauce appropriately named the 911. im a spice guy myself so it was well received.after that, we enjoyed the heated snow white roll that melted in our mouth and was clearly our favorite. the service was top notch and they were quick on the drink refills without a single issue. we stayed talking for a bit and although most places seemed pushy after a meal, they were happy enough to keep asking to refill our drinks, which was refreshing. we give this grand opening a great review because it was great service, great food and not too bad on the price for great atmosphere and a clean establishment. thanks for the good stuff, highly recommended, though go hungry for the allyoucaneat as youll definitely want to try out most of their great combinations.
awesome sushi!! great prices and all you can eat!! exceptional service in a neat traditional japanese setting.  even met the owner andy ...i think :. i would highly recommend.  we tried everything from the miso soup to the awesome spicy tuna on crispy rice! the chef prides himself on having super high quality tuna and beef options as well!
best sushi in town! the sushi will speak for itself!! the menu is extensive and the sushi is to die for! the restaurant has a traditional atmosphere with a modern edge. great place to watch sports on the flat screen tvs and enjoy all you can drink with your sushi! my personal favorite things to order are the crispy rice with spicy tuna, the spicy tuna hand rolls, and any type of their traditional sushi.
unbelievable stuff!  andy and his staff are gonna get a reputation fast around here for having topnotch food and service.  i had multiple rolls and capped it with the honey toast, everything was just delightful.  this place is a wonderful addition to our neighbourhood and we hope they stay for many years to come.  i am their newest regular.
this place is great. so good, i went twice in one week. last saturday, my friend and i were meeting in that area of town for lunch and to get piercings. we were both ravenous, so ayce sushi was the obvious answer. i checked yelp and hanabi had fabulous reviews. we are around 4:30 in the afternoon, and the place was empty. but that just lead to an amazing experience. we chose to sit at the bar and the ladies who manage the bar were prompt, polite, and gave great recommendations. when i went for myself second visit, we sat at a table, but our experience was just as good. our waiter was so nice, gave great recommendations, and even let us get away with using our one per person to order two of the same thing for one person. when it comes to food, everything was so fresh, creative, and the presentation was amazing. their sashimi was the perfect portions and they have lots of non sushi items too, so this place is great if you want to check it out with a non raw fish eater. you have to try the sushi bomb roll, the sunset roll, animal style roll, and the mona lisa roll. the cocosalmon roll was also very creative and good.this place is a hidden gem in village square and if your a fan of delicious flavor, you should check them out!
the customer service at this restaurant is amazing. for starters id recommend the fried garlic chicken superb for garlic lovers!, jalapeno poppers, and pork belly roll. we ordered oysters, yellowtail, green muscles, alaskan king crab, and toro which was all fantastic.  the sharaku sake was extremely smooth and sweet. my only complaint is that there isnt 6 stars to give to this place!
ive got a new spot for ayce and its hanabi. a bunch of roll options and fresh fish. it wasnt packed like some of the other places in town but i think its just because theyre relatively new and undiscovered. andy, the owner, is very friendly along with his staff. great environment, great food, great value.

finally! a great sushi restaurant in summerlin!!  nice bright setup, fantastic prompt service, fresh tasty sushi. sushi chefs andy owner and chris were delightful and engaged during our visit making sure everything served was exactly as ordered and to our satisfaction. as sushi fanatics, our group was overwhelmingly impressed with the qualitytasteand selection. huge menu! from the tuna poke to the kobe beef our taste buds were in constant excitement as every dish served never failed to impress.noteable musthaves: alaskan king crab, toro, citrus yellow tail all of the tuna is excellent, oyster, jumbo scallop phenomenal!, fried garlic chicken, a5 kobe beef not an easy find in vegas.great experience. this is my new goto sushi spot. as an added bonus the selection for your nonsushi eating friends was superb. let andy or any of the chefs know and they will cater to any request. our nonsushi eating friends what!? were pleasantly surprised by the selection and tastes they were able to enjoy.
im so happy we have a local sushi restaurant, in summerlin!!!hanabi was absolutely delicious! great rolls, sashimi and sushi. service is awesome and you will leave satisfied! the fish is fresh and selections are numerous! i also loved the appetizers. there is ayce all you can eat and a la carte. the place is inviting and as a true sports fan i love that u can watch it on numerous big screens.
if you are looking for the best all you can eat sushi in las vegas this is the place for you. owner andy kim worked at nobu and yellowtail which i love and it shows with the quality of the fish and sauces. great selection of sake and great sake!!!
the fish, fresh; just came in halibut!we were treated with a few chefs specials grace a chef chris; great guy. an overall delicious experience. close to home. will b back, soon.
i want to start by saying how amazing andy the owner is! we followed him from his old sushi bar to here just because of his hospitality, the variety and different rolls that you cant really find elsewhere, and the premium quality of the fish. he always had something new to try and he gets very creative with his menu! loved eating here! we will definitely be back.
finally a good all you can eat in the area! good menu and fresh fish. trust your server on their recommendations.  thrilled we dont have to drive so far for good ayce anymore.
amazing food great people so friendly. thank you for a wonderful meal, we will be back
i happened to have a really good experience here. i usually dont care about the level of service im receiving as long as the food is good, but in all seriousness, the waiters and waitresses were extremely attentive on my visit, which i was really appreciative about. i especially appreciated how the owner was really friendly!but on to the more important topic, food:the appetizers here were sooooo good. i forgot the names of them, but one of them had like a spicy salmon that you mix with seaweed. you mix it up and then eat together. the flavor was so good! i believe it was called salmon poke. who knew mixing the two would taste so good together?i went with a group of sushi eaters, so i cant comment much about the rolls since our meal mostly consisted of sushi. i really enjoyed the tuna, which after having visited japan, i get really weird about eating tuna here in the states because nothing tastes as the real deal. but the tuna here was surprisingly good! my favorite was the mackerel though i believe it was. it tasted extremely fresh and had the nice flavor you expect out of piece of sushi.my group also ordered a yellowtail collar that was so good. the meat was soft. it had really good flavor, and i seriously wished i ordered more of it.we also had kobe beef here, and it was sooo good. it shocked me to see that they had real kobe beef, but they even had an official certification for how legit the beef was.
las vegas has sushi places everywhere, but this was the best weve ever had!!  sushi was fresh and service was fast and friendly.  as soon as we sat down, the server asked if we wanted water to start with.  she also suggested sushi rolls which were popular.  we ordered the buy one get one free sake special with a beer which they suggested.  when we asked for the free sake they told us that the beer would cost extra which other places do not do.  we ordered honey toast for dessert, but they ran out.  the chef came out and personally suggested a dessert which was delicious!! we are definitely coming back and have found a new regular spot to eat at!!
awesome! great atmosphere. if you like spicy, definitely get the yellowtail special. sushi bomb is also scrumptious.
this place has excellent service. always clean and welcoming. owner andy make us feel welcome every time.  the food is always  fresh and delicious.
my new favorite sushi place in town. ive been to many sushi places in las vegas and i finally found decent place for ayce sushi.  so many food to choose from and fast and friendly service. thx to owner  andy and crews.
great sushi at a great price! very friendly  accommodating staff. will definitely be back!
went in for the first time. servers and chefs were friendly. sushi tastes fresh and flavorful. will return in the future to try the ayce! happy hour has great prices also!
great food. friendly staff.good ayce assortment. good happy hour.my boyfriend and i will be back!
the ayce was a great deal.   the service was wonderful.  andy kept checking to make sure everything was to our liking.  all the sushi tasted fresh and was well prepared.   the tuna and salmon were particularly fresh and tasty.   the soft shell crab was done to perfection.  was not a fan of the beef teriyaki or the bacon mushroom that someone ordered but cannot mark them down since generally i do not order those dishes when i go to sushi.
this place is awesome!!!! menu is great so much to choose from. i love how this place has so many option not a typical sushi place. you can eat all you can eat and not only eat sushi but eat entrees like fried rice and soups. all the food is made fresh to order. the service is great! i love yama sushi but this place beats it cause again the food is fresh and service is great. i was very impressed with meeting the owner as he was walking around meeting his customers and getting feed back. now thats great to see as he takes interest with what the customers has to say. you dont see that in alot of place. andys pretty cool to talk to, his humble, and very down to earth. their quality of sushi is very different, you can taste the difference. and that difference is that there quality is fresh. trust and believe me when i say andy is a proud chef and did explain he like everything fresh and clean. here at hanabi you can taste the freshness and how exotic there sushi is. it will leave a taste on your taste buds wanting more. i highly recommend this place to all the sushi lovers!!!!
great food and great service. the owner was very nice and i wish him the best of luck with his new business.!!
this place is a gem. the fish is always fresh and the owner is always here checking on the customers personally. he is one of the nicest restaurant owners and people you will ever meet. there is an all you can eat option and a la carte. they have very high end fish and kobe beef as well as more entry level priced options. if you are craving some exotic fish he will order it in for you. we have been here 5 times now and it never disappoints.
still love this place. yummy, great food, great people! !!!! amazing everything. it was my birthday and i could have picked anywhere in vegas and still picked hanabi
great place good sushi... no intimidating menu clean. a little gem if you are looking for sushi on this side of town.
the best sushi i have ever had. the owner andy  manager chris are the nicest most honest people ive met! they were very inviting even though they were going to close. did not feel rush at all. very modern with a traditional taste. they took the time to get to know us and my daughter. great with kids! this is my go to spot now.
great sushi place for lunch. have an all you can eat option but prefer ordering from the menu. the crunchy california roll was my favorite. good miso soup
undoubtedly the best sushi i have had in vegas for many years! with the coming and going of so many sushi places on the west side, it was a real treat to find hanabi. it was recommended by a friend, and has become one of my regular stops when choosing a place to dine out. the menu has a wide range of appetizers and rolls, some unlike other standard joints. my favorite has become the coco salmon roll. coconut shrimp tempura, cream cheese and cucumber wrapped up in sushi rice and seaweed. they top it with fresh salmon sashimi and that wonderful spicy japanese mayo. finally it is topped off with shredded coconut. cant get enough of this one! the staff is beyond friendly and andy, the owner takes his time to greet all the customers and take personal pride in the dishes being served. he, himself, was nobu trained. any sushi lover knows the quality that entails. dont forget to try something different here, like the seared pork belly appetizer, or the honey toast dessert. your palette will thank you over and over again. they stay open until 11pm, so not really too much of a latenight spot, but perfect when you get the craving for quality sushi for lunch, dinner or that late dinner when youre too busy doing other things and dont get the chance to eat until 9pm!
this place has the freshest sushi in vegas ! always a good time when we come here . staff is nice .. quiet environment and great location! try the fried jalapenos and the crab mania they are amazing ! i love this place and will come back many many times !!!
the sushi here was really fresh. larger selection of nigiri and hot dishes than a lot of other places. definitely going to be my new spot!
awesome new place! fresh sushi and a great menu! we had all you can eat and a bottle of wine. took our time and tried a bunch of items. everything was tasty and super fresh! will definitely be coming back as a regular.
i love hanabi!!! the quality and taste of the food is amazing! the owner, andy always makes us feel at home. zo and jun made us a special roll, we just told them what we liked and they made us a delicious creation! chris is also an amazing sushi chef! the 50 off special for december super nice. ayce is a great deal. you should definitely try this place, you will not be disappointed!
went for early lunch today. nice friendly quick service. chose the all you can eat option and it tasted fine. atmosphere was nice and clean with modern design. from the outside it looks small but inside is nice and roomy. great place for sushi before or after taking in a movie. id come back fosure.
hands down, the best sushi i have ever had in my life! and i have had a lot. i will be a regular here for sure!
this is probably the best sushi ever, if you talking customer satisfaction, this is the best service ever. owner andy, are always smile and humble. foods are always fresh, price are good and dont forget to try the desert. they have a special desert.
omg. the food here is amazing. i had all you can eat and each of the sushi pieces were thick. service is great, overall this is like a hidden gem. secret: try their udon soup. best udon i experienced in las vegas.
it was fun and great place to make and design your own cup. i went to vegas trip and found a deal on amazon local and it was really cheap. it was fun experience and had to go pick up from southern california. so had another vegas trip. i love vegas!!! and this place!!!!
i had my daughters 8th birthday party at bee creative ceramics. it was amazing! she had everything decorated and organized. she had put out all of the variety of ceramic pieces that was in the price range that was in my birthday party package so the kids knew what they could choose from. i didnt have to stress about a thing!! i loved it. oh yes... the best part was that she suggested a paint that the kids could make and take their art home the same day!
went in yesterday looking for a couple of bar stools. couldnt believe it, the bar stools i had found on line were 50.....over 300 in savings each. i was able to find 3 perfect ones and as luck would have it, they were just bringing out  the truck they received and i found the same lamp id been looking at on line as well!
its hard to find good italian roast beef out here in arizona ,but portillos brings me back to chicago. if the owners were smart they would come out to west gate as well.
i have to say that im thoroughly impressed with the service and quality of the food here.  having just opened up here in tempe, i assumed that when my coworkers and i decided to go here for lunch that we would encounter issues: no parking massive lines waiting forever for food that would be cold by the time we got iti was rewarded for my pessimism with parking attendants who directed us right to a parking spot.  the line was long but we all had our food in less than 10 minutes.  the staff was smiling and very helpful.the food....it was awesome.  i got the italian beef with hot peppers and it was phenomenal!  im pretty sure i inhaled it without chewing enough it was that good.  contemplated getting another sandwich but then thought the better of it. i will definitely be coming back, but it will be difficult to try the other menu items since the italian beef was so good
its portillos...you get the italian beef or the chopped salad.  both are amazing!  its what you crave when you are from chicagoland.
i am such a fan of portillos after having it at the first location in sdale and this location is just as great. the employees are all so welcoming and jolly :i think i love everything on the menu but if you want something sweet, get the cake shake, it is heaven in a cupi am having a salad tonight, the grilled chicken caesar... :as much as i wanted the drenched italian beef, i ate so much this weekend that a salad is much needed oh portillos, you shall see me all the time
husband and i went there last night......awesome experience!food was amazing.....i got the hamburger and he go the chili cheese hot dog and a sausage. we also got the fries! even though it was super crowded, our food was out quick! i cant believe how clean the place was with the amount of people that were there. every employee was busy and positive. we had a great experience with an employee. her name was stephanie. after we finished, my husband and i were just talking. she approached us and asked how our meal was, gave us some suggestions for next time and was just chatting with us. we were sitting over by the shakecake counter and i told her how i was debating getting a piece of chocolate cake. she told us how she helped make it from scratch that morning and that we had to try it. convincing me to eat any type of sweet is not hard, so needless to say i ordered a piece. it was unreal! super moist and the frosting was the best ive ever had! between the service, the food and the employees....we had a great experience. we will for sure be back!
i ate at portillos all the time when i was a child in chicago. the italian beef, wet, is to die for. great french fries, great food, great service, great atmosphere loud which is great for young families. if you havent eaten at this chicago staple, youre missing out! im so glad they came to arizona!
i fail to understand the criticisms on here.  its great to finally have a place that has great italian beefs in the valley. honestly....ive never had better italian beef than in chicago.  the 2 best are one place i dont even remember the name of....and portillos.  theyve brought the greatness to arizona.  the beef is tender and the beef and gravy super flavorful.  get it dipped or not....but always get an extra side of gravy for dipping.  you have to sop up every last bit with whatever remaining bread you have.  the shakes.  delicious also.  fries....standard but tasty.  its amazing to have a great italian beef shop out here.  ...and everything else....including the salads....cant go wrong.
when dick portillo opened his first dog house restaurant, im sure even he did not realize that his restaurants would become a chicagoland institution.  the beef and cheddar croissant is the best item on the menu, hands down.  if ya aint had it, then have it.  if ya dont like italian beef sandwiches, then go see a doctor and then have it!and their chicago dog is one of the best in chitown, so try it... youll like it.with multiple locations opening here in phoenix, it sure helps me to get over my longing for food from my ol home!  sweet home, chicago... er, phoenix!  yeah, babyyy!
the food quality is so consistent at portillos and the tempe location is no exception. went with coworkers and they all really enjoyed it and said theyd be back. i had the italian sausage sandwich with sweet and hot peppers dipped and it was outstanding. i recommended the combo sandwich to one of the first timers and he loved it. other great reviews at the table for the beef sandwich, fries, onion rings and chocolate cake shake. i dont remember ever having to chew a shake before, but this is awesome!
my parents wedding cake was portillos chocolate cake!!! im from chicago and nearly passed out with excitement when i found out a portillos was being built in arizona! when eating mychicago dog, dipped italian beef or drinking my chocolate cake shake, its like im back in chicago. i went 4 days in a row and sometimes go twice in one day! i cannot get enough!
love, love, love this place! we go every week now for a late lunch to avoid the crowd but its worth thinking about it all day!!
my first time coming here and it was amazing. awesome service. super fast. clean! one of the friendliest genuinely happy staffs. not to mention the food was delicious. fresh and very filling. fries were hot crispy and nicely salted. burger was charbroiled to perfection and super juicy. thanks for the awesome experience! highly recommend this place!!
oh portillos. so bad but so good. when i need a bag of grease i splurge at portillos, and their new location makes that easier to accomplish than the first in scottsdale. believe it or not, their salads are also huge and awesome, and they even come with a great little muffin. if you are a food snob then you might want to stick with them instead of the hot dogs!
as good as it gets for italian beefs in the valley of the sun! its a must try for anyone craving authentic chicago style food. what to get: italian beef add sweet and hot peppers and most importantly their cheese fries. they give you the side of cheese so you can dip or drench your fries at your own pace. although this is fast food, dont expect to be in and out quick on your lunch break. its always busy!
i usually dont drink the koolaid when it comes to the new place in town but i had  two frinds of mine from chicago swear by this place, and there were dead on. the place is huge with a super large menu but do not pass go, and get you the beef sandwich. you can add peppers or onions, i only added cheese to get the full taste of the beef. the bread is baked in  house and amazing. the beef was super tender and just done perfect. ive had italian beef sandwiches before and they were just okay, but this one will make  you a believer! i also had the tamale ina  bowl, that was a midwestern style tamale covered in chili. anotehr cool dish. i have been dying to go back since i went for the first time. go now. eat beef sandwich. then go again.
italian beef dipped with hot peppers....amazing! i could almost eat it everyday. got to have my fix at least once a week. hot dogs are awesome too.
officially a stalker of portillos.  officially.  my friend, who is a chicagoan, brought me here a couple weeks ago to pop my chicago dog cherry.  it was completely and utterly worth the drive!  i am a fairly plain hot dog type of person...ketchup, mustard, relish, thats it.   but i am one of those when in rome type folks.  so, i went balls to the wall and got the full on chicago dog with all the toppings.  tomatoes. pickle.  green relish. sport peppers. onions. steamed poppy seed bun.  best hot dog experience of my life!  these arent anything like stadium hot dogs, wienerschnitzel dogs, or those hot dogs that have buns that fall apart at family barbeques.  no siree bob.  i only wish i would have ordered two.  they make a mean arnold palmer.  having to wipe the drool off my keyboard here.i shared an order of their cheese fries with my friend as well.  their fries are of the crinkle variety and are in no way soggy or lacking in flavor.  perfectly salty.  perfectly crispy.   mmmmm mmmmm goooooood.  i could lick that cup of cheese sauce clean well after the fries are gone too. ive already been back for a second trip only 2 weeks later and had myself their italian beef dipped with hot peppers.  while it was also tasty, i am most definitely a chicago dog kind of gal.  this time, i also had their famous chocolate cake.  at first glance, this slice of cake looks like something like that would make the roof of your mouth stick to your tongue.  but it is moist, not too overly sweet, its perfectly chocolatey, and i didnt even need a glass of milk to go with it.  apparently, they use mayonnaise in their batter.  i will be back for more and i am completely in trouble if a portillos makes its way out to the west valley...but i wouldnt be torn up if it did either.
one of my favorite places to splurge.  i get the big beef italian beef sandwich but bigger than the regular with hot peppers and dunked in the beef drippings.  it comes out so moist and flavorful that my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  their french fries are also great, crispy and hot with just the right amount of salt.  i have tried their burgers and salads as well and they are okay, but i think i will just stick with the beef sandwiches from now on.
best chicago food ive had in az.  maxwell polish is great, onions are perfect and the sausage has really good flavor.  dogs are ok.  i prefer redhots over vienna beef any day.  burgers are legit.  i generally dont like chicago burgers and i didnt care for them here.  italian beef is sooo jucie and flavorfull with the right bread.  italian sausage is perfect, with the right amount of spice.  service is great. everyone is friendly and helpful.  they flew out chicago people to get this place going right!  they dont charge a ridiculous amount for the food like most chicago places.
so happy to have one of these right near my house. on second thought, maybe not so happy as its hard to pass by and not stop! portillos was always a popular stop when we were visiting chicago making the menu quite familiar to me. i have eaten here a few times and done both the drivethru and the restaurant. the service has been wonderful every time. i always get the same thing: italian beef, dipped, with sweet peppers and a fry. while they are called portillos hot dogs, the italian beef is really the star of their menu. having it dipped is the true chicago experience and adds that extra something to the already flavorful beef. the fries are also traditional chicago hot dog standstyle, and i like them, but they arent spectacular and who would expect them to be for a fast food joint?.
mmmmmm!!! i am a portillos fan from growing up in chicago. in fact, their cheese fries were a major contributing factor to my childhood obesity... lol. i love the cheese fries. so, it really brought me back to the good old days. i got a bacon cheeseburger and it just tasted so fresh and great. the bacon was not as crisp as i would like it, but the burger was fantastic. i would just get a cheeseburger next time. ive also tried the grilled fish sandwich before which was really good too.
im not from chicago, so i never heard of this place, but was glad to have a good friend from chicago introduce me.  the hamburgers are great and the fries delicious. i cant get enough of this place. ive started venturing out the hamburger and fries and tried the italian beef  its awesome     cant wait to try more things on the menu.  i need some portillos!
i had bought into the hype about the hot dogs from this place, so expectations were high. i had the chili cheese dog and it may be the best one i have ever had. i had a rare craving for one and it lived up to the hype. it is work the stop if you are looking for a great dog!
outstanding! as good as the portillos i visited in chicago a couple of years ago. huge huge joint, lots of parking, tons of seating inside and out, fast service, awesome food. superimpressed with the speed of service at the height of the lunch rush. many lines open and all moving quickly, and food came up quickly. i had a bacon cheeseburger  orings and they were both excellent. next time i need to have a chicago dog  one of the finest foods on the planet.
the phoenix metro area is just another huge suburb of chicago.  i recommend this location on a sunny day in january during a midwestern polar vortex halo; now back to my chocolate cake shake ...
i expected to pay a ton because i was thinking it was gourmet hot dogs, but their prices are reasonable.  try the strawberry shortcake. its a generous portion and tastes better than it looks.  the drive though is really convenient and the people working are pretty nice.  food is better than average.  i didnt mark them down for anything because the experience was good.
chicago dog  italian beef whot peppers  amazing. i dont understand the negative reviews. this place is a chicago food lovers machine. turning through an insane amount of hungry patrons per hour. order number 94 out the door!
two words: italian beef. get it dipped with hot peppers, and your life will never be the same. i live for italian beef sandwiches, and this place knows how to make them. add their tasty fries and you have yourself a very, very good meal. the wait is not too bad even when they are packed because the staff are fastpaced and highenergy. seating is pretty ample, too, and of the three times ive been since they opened, its always been a great experience. next time, ill have to give the hot dogs a try, but its so hard to skip on the beef...
soooooo good. this chicago girl was so excited when they opened a portillos out in arizona. i always get the big beef dipped with sweet peppers and mozzarella cut in half and large cheese fries! chocolate cake shake with no syrup! yum!!!! i havent had a bad experience yet and i have been here like 10 times already.  mmmm chicago food. they really have the best beef sandwiches and hotdogs!
first trip to portillos and will go many more times.  burgers are the best.  daughter purchased the sausage and raved about it.  she and her niece shared a chocolate cake shake.  happy that they serve coke products.  lots of room for lots of customers and it was lunch time.  very quick and efficient.  staff is just the greatest.  granddaughter loves hot dogs so this was the perfect venue for her!  she called it portfolios!!!
the hotdogs are delicious! comes with all the fixings like relish, tomatoes, pickles, pepper, etc. you can also get the polish sausage chicago style too! basically, it replaces the hotdog with a sausage. i just eat everything altogether... even the long pickle. trust me, its more delicious that way.i can see why this place is packed. there are lines and it may seem crowded at times, but its pretty quick to place an order and get your food.the tamale was also piping hot and very delicious. loved it. didnt expect this place to serve it but it does. and its pretty cheap.the burger was ok. just your normal burger. i mean, this is a hotdog place, in my opinion. so order hotdogs. i havent tried the salads yet but very soon, i will!
fresh, hot, cooked to order chicagostyle food. they do it right here. will definitely repeat. get the beef dipped, thank me later.
i have been here about 3 times now and have not been disappointed on any occasion. i love, love, love the chilli cheese dog and the salads are great as well. honestly i was a bit weirded out the first time i had the chop salad because it had pasta in it however it was super yummy.  the fries are always tasty and well salted. i love the inside of the place it is fun and funky.
loved the chicago dog! loved it!  i mean the neon green relish, peppers, pickles, tomatoes, etc...perfect! and then the cake...the chocolate cake.  super moist and should be shared!
we couldnt wait for our favorite chicago restaurant to come to arizona.  the best italian beef sandwiches ever.  the only thing that would make it better, is if they would open up a portillos in santan mall in gilbert, az.
chocolate cake shake  wowza! i really dig this place. i am amazed every time that i go in this restaurant, it runs like a well oiled machine. the employees at the registers are very knowledgeable about the menu, the staff when you go to pick up your food all seemed like they really enjoyed and wanted to be at work. its just an over all happy environment even when they are extremely busy. recommendations: first off  you must, and i mean must get the chocolate cake shake! if you cant tell i am a big fan! chopped salad is delightful, consists of chopped lettuce and small pasta noodles with chicken, bacon, cabbage, tomatoes and house dressing. it also comes with onion and gorgonzola cheese which i had taken off. the salad also comes with one of their spectacular warm lemon poppy seed muffins.   grilled tuna sandwich, tuna wlettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. you must love tuna to enjoy this sandwich. big beef, be prepared as this is a very large sandwich. its italian beef on french bread. the beef is well flavored and if you add cheddar cheese or mozzarella to the sandwich it is out of this world.  onion rings: they are not to thick or thin and they are not overbattered like most onion rings are. they are light, crispy and awesome!i have yet to try the hot dogs, i plan to on my next portillos adventure. hope you stop in and enjoy this place as much as i do. one last time.....get the cake shake!
everything here is excellent! if you have never tried an italian beef sandwich, this is definitely the place to be!! the best hot dogs too! salads are freshly prepared in front of you and they have a nice variety. dont forget your cheese fries, shakes, malt, and burger selection. if you do go the takeout route, their drivethru has two lanes and is always well managed. staff is always friendly and polite. enjoy!!
love this place! fell in love while vacationing in chicago and couldnt wait for it to come to the valley. our family fav!!!
by far the best hot dog joint in town! a must try is the italian beef sausage with sweet and hot peppers dipped in gravy sounds weird but it creates an orgasmic combination of flavors! melts in your mouth. dont be deceived by my poor photography skills as the photo does no justice. also the chili cheese dog and regular hot dog was tasty! the bun is top notch, it is soft, fluffy and fresh tasting you can tell its a quality bun!!! seriously best choice for affordable gourmet food and the service is phenomenal, fast and friendly!! this is foodie paradise.
im a big fan of chicago style beef and this place does it right. this is a must if youre in the tempe area and looking for a great sandwich or or great atmosphere. the service is fast without sacrificing quality. you can dine in and take in all the chicago nostalgia or be through the drivethru in minutes if you are in a rush and need a quick bite. great food, great experience.
leaving chicago was heartbreaking, but a portillos opened in tempe just weeks after i arrived in arizona! there arent very many outside illinois, so consider yourselves lucky.when i ate meat, the italian beef and sausage combo was my goto.now, restricting myself to fish only, im super happy with the grilled tuna sandwich.seriously, everything on the menu is dynamite.
man oh man, do i love portillos. before they moved into the tempe marketplace location, their other restaurant was located in scottsdale  a bit too far for me even if im at the halfway point!there are also a couple of other hot dog eateries around tempe, but for portillos its located right outside of tempe marketplace, so i can get my shop on after eating a hot dog and lose all those calories i just consumed haha! i come here with my family and we usually just order their hot dogs, my sister has tried their burgers and salads, but she wasnt a big fan of them.the decor is a throwback to the poodle skirt era hello 1950s!. its large inside, and can sit large groups of people within your party. they have booths as well as open seated tables, i like grabbing a booth because it just seems more fun and retro for some reason, but i also like grabbing a seat by the windows because it feels like youre in a cafe. the best way i can put it is if youve eaten at one of disneylands restaurants, you have that soft comfort murmur of people outside and around you which i really like. if you can brave the 110 heat, you can also sit outside in their patio which is equally as large. there are fans overhead and the area is covered by a ramada to add to ambiance of eating hot dogs and burgers in your patio or your neighbors. eating outside of portillos is really nice during our cool months though, its very enjoyable!when you go to order your food, staff will be there to ask if youve eaten there before, if you havent theyll explain the menu to you. when you order they write everything on paper bags  this way they know what you ordered and you wont get mixed up orders when you receive your food in the bags! you have to be attentive when they call your order out, they will not deliver your food to your table, so we usually wait around the window for our food or sit in the booth waiting for our number to be called. numbers are not called in order, its whenever the food gets out, so if youre one of those people who gets angry that number 85 got called before your 55, take a chill pill, because your food is coming out, just gotta have some patience!the staff also makes up rhymes when your number is called, its awesome! so far i usually order the polish hot dog with american cheese  but i can eat their crinkle cut fries and cheese sauce all. day.
portillos my love. any chicagoan knows and loves portillos! that being said ive tried many a replica restaurants of places i used to eat back home and usually they arnt the same something is always a little off, but not at portillos. fresh strawberry shakes or a cake shake if you dare. beef and cheddar extra gravy please! portillos makes being away from home just a bit more bare able.
i love hot dogs and now i happen to love chicago dogshavent tried them until portillos opened. i also got to try a few bites of my boyfriends italian beef sandwich but he didnt get the peppers at all so now i have to make a separate trip to try it with the peppers soon.  im obsessed with the jumbo dogs and also have to try it charred just to see how that is even though im not a crazy fan about burnt food.. the french fries were decent nothing that made me want to run for the hills and scream about it.  between the jumbo chicago hot dog and the italian beef i think that has me hooked enough. still need to try more on the menu since its pretty lengthy.  last night i got the chocolate cake shake and good god thats the first time i havent been able to finish a small shake. way too sweet for me. definitely something thats a one and done type of thing for sure. its definitely got all the frosting and such in the shake and the texture threw me off a bit since its not smooth. : not my kind of thing. weird for me to say just too much going on in that shake for me.
a few years ago i visited the portillos in chicago.  we stayed at the hotel next door and i cant say that i was excited about trying italian beef for the first time.  i left that experience blown away.  i went back one more time before i left chicago and prayed i would get a chance to partake in the italian beef again.  when portillos landed in tempe, i didnt expect the food to compare to the chicago locale.  i was wrong again.  its as if chicago came to tempe.  the italian beef is unbelievable.  i recommend upping the ante and getting the big beef.  the crinkle fries are good, but the breaded onion rings are phenomenal.   i also really like the hot dog and polish sausage.  and dont forget the chili with onions.  its damn good chili.its rare to see portillos empty, but even when theres a line inside or out, they manage to miraculously get your order to you in about 5 minutes.  tip 1if you dont like your big beef soggy, ask for the gravy on the side.  and theres no harm in adding hot peppers to your sandwich either!tip 2portillos doesnt serve beer, so flask it or stop by bevmo during one of their weekend tasting sessions for a little preparty action.
famous for the italian beef go ahead and get it with the extra gravy and sweet peppers.  now try to eat that without dripping on yourself.  they even have some vegetarian items that are pretty good if youre being carbonconscious.  but if you have to have some beef, this is a good place to splurge!
this place is amazing. i moved to az from chicago 15 years ago and i missed this place. try the beef sandwich dipped. the chicago dog is amazing. french fries are perfect. if you care about healthy food, go somewhere else. this is about comfort.
love this place for the italian beef sandwiches and fries, they are both amazing.  same quality as the locations in chicago.  big thumb up!
my husbands a picky eater and its hard to find a place we both enjoy. this place hits the spot for both of us. the burgers are yum, fries are perfection, salads are awesome, and dont get me started on the shakes and chocolate cake. i just wish there was a portillos in the east valley. the atmosphere is very family friendly and employees are very upbeat. the prices are kinda high for for a fast food joint, but its worth it.
this place has the best hot dogs and beefs in the phoenix area. i also really like how fast there service is and will never go to another place to get a hot dog. really brings me back to my days in chicago.
being from chicago i absolutely love being able to get a taste of home every once in awhile since phoenix isnt exactly known for its food.
im officially  obsessed with this place. the food is great, and they have the best arnold palmer around! you can tell the place is amazing right when you walk inand see how packed the place gets! : love love love this place!
deliciousness!! thats what i say after each visit to portillos!  this is a legendary chicago restaurant...entering this restaurant brings me right back home.hands down the best beef sandwich in the valley!  make sure to get it dipped for an extra soggy bun.   the fries are crispy with the perfect amount of salt.   top it off with a chocolate shake and you have yourself a meal!  the hot dogs are authentic and actually have a poppy seed bun....a rare find in az!  i love this place and will continue to come back again and again.  you can take the girl out of chicago, but you cant take chicago out of the girl.  thanks for portillos for giving me a little piece of home right here in az!
being from chicago and living in el paso now, you get these cravings for italian beef and chicago style hot dogs.  its a chicago thing.  visited phoenix and had to make the drive to eat here.  ate here two nights in a row for dinner. :had the combo, dipped with hot peppers both nights.  had fries and a jumbo hot dog as well.  have to give them credit for consistency.  ive eaten at a few of the chicagoland portillos locations and they all taste the same, theyre all good!  i asked for my sandwich wet instead of dipped at first but the manager didnt know what i meant so i just said dip it.service was typical portillos with their unique number calling system.  this place reminds me of home.
dipped combo is to die for!  never been a fan of subs, beef, sausage, or anything chicago style . . . but i will gladly drive 20 minutes for this place!  oh, and the fries?  crispy and hot every time.  tried the chocolate cake shake, not a fan.  taste was good but i couldnt get past the texture.  be prepared for a crowd.  looks like their salads are awesome, but i gotta be honest.  i just cant order one instead of the combo.
i normally get drive thru everytime because it is always soooo crowded! yes even drive thru but atleast the guys taking your order along the line know what their doing and have the right device to take your order so you dont wait forever.their fries.. just.. those are enough lol but their hotdogs are awesome and taste so fresh. i dont remember what i ordered but there was a bunch of stuff on it like carmelized onions and diced tomatoesi dont remember what else and the hot dog was definitely big enough to hold all those ingredients. good portions, and everything is always so flavorful and hot when you get it!
first heard about this place from my husband because he had it in chicago, so as soon as the scottsdale one opened we went...not a big fan of the hot dogsgasp but theyre burgers were pretty good..i loved the shake, and most of all the cheese fries!!!
been totally addicted to this place since living in chicago.  used to have to take day trips just to go to their moreno valley location in the middle of the california desert or order online to get my fix.  nice to have this location and scottsdale both right off the 101 to get my jumbo dog and italian beef on demand.  no matter how insanely busy they can get, service is always fast and with a  smile.  this place is a well oiled machine.  best chicago dogs and beef in the valley!
really good italian beef. definitely a must with the cheese fries. delicious!!!not a big fan of the chocolate cake shake, a little too sweet for me.
i grew up with a portillos down the street. so, you can imagine how thrilled i was when i heard a couple locations were opening up in phoenix. as always, the italian beef is a must. their shakes, cheese fries, hotdogs, and burgers are all to die for as well.
i visited this restaurant for the first time a few days ago. wow!!! its a retro 1950s chicagothemed fast food restaurant specializing in hot dogs, sausages and burgers. they also have an extensive salad menu. they play 1950s music and the decor matches. this is a fun place to take children to or a fun family outing.i thought the food was spectacular! i also tried the, pumpkin shake which was outofthisworld!i hereby confer a solid 5 star rating!
first time here. was actually headed somewhere else for dinner, but saw this place and did a uturn. chili dog was good. bread was nice and soft. fries were crispy and salty yum. asked what kind of shakes they had and was not disappointed when i tried their chocolate cake shake. double yum! ordered a tamale, too, but didnt get a chance to eat it since i was stuffed. will definitely come back here every time im in town. customer service was not bad. staff seem to be friendly. thanks for an awesome first time experience!
this place rocks! its like being back home in the chicago burbs. ole dick portillos knows how to put out great product even in the az! keep it up the great work and perhaps we can meet up again in cali?
taste of home!!! my familys roots are from chicago and i grew up eating italian beef sandwiches.  being so far away it was a rare layover at ohare that would get me this combination.   portillos is an amazing eatery that has a long, but fast moving line. i highly recommend the italian beef and cheese with sweet peppers,  wet. this means the sandwich is dipped into au jus and it creates a succulent bite!!! their fries are great and you can top it off with a chocolate cake shake!!!there are options for those that live the lighter fare and chicago hot dogs, but id go for the italian beef!!!!
get the pumpkin pie shake while you can!!! its the best! loving it tonight!tried the beef and cheddar croissant... not my favorite.  will stick with the classic italian beef on hoagie. brought my parents from chicago because the cant find italian beef in atlanta!
love it!  the dipped italian beef with peppers is so good!  the onion rings have a nice light batter...get cheese sauce to dunk.   get the strawberry shortcake to take home for later.   busy place but very efficient and friendly staff.
delicious! order the italian beef, extra gravy with mozz. cheese! crinkle cut fries! they also have awesome a stellar chopped salad, hot dogs, and chocolate cake shake! yum!! always hot good chicago style food :
my date and i thoroughly enjoyed our experience here at portillos.. she got the italian beef and i got the big beef. very nice flavor in the beef and the bread was excellent. highly recommended from the two of us for sure.
my husband and i went here for the first time tonight and love it.  very fun atmosphere and great food.  he got the big beef and i had the hot dog it was loaded with everything,  mustard relish onions tomatoes dill pickles and peppers oh so good and the small chili cheese dog also delicious.  we decided we wanted to try the cheese fries and i have to say ive never been to a place that serves you more cheese sauce then you need before and it was hot and not barely warm like most places serve it.  so good.  we cant wait to go back.
this place never disappoints.i dont go here often but it always puts a smile on my face when i get sloppy with the big beef sandwich with both hot and sweet peppers and side of gravy.  if the beef and cheddar croissant could hold more beef and not fall apart when it gets dipped then i would definitely say its the perfect sandwich.  being a man who respects chicago style beef and sandwiches, this place is probably the best phoenix has to offer.  i recommend it to anyone who is looking for a hearty meal with great chicago style food.
what a pleasant surprise.  from reading alot of the reviews, it seems people are expecting something from this restaurant that, quite simply, this restaurant is not.  this is a pretty cheap restaurant that even offers drivethru.  i had the ceaser salad and grilled tuna burger and ordered through the drivethru.  i also made some custimizations sub cheese for tartar sauce on the tuna; salad dressing on side, and they were all perfected.  the tuna burger was the best drivethru, nonmeat, item i have ever had.  and the salad was very good with an entire egg and tomatoes, items which i really like in a ceasar, even if not traditional.  overall, if you are looking for drivethru and want some new, unique options, then this is the best place in phoenix area as far as i am concerned.
love this place!so happy they have one close to home. burgers,chicken sandwich, hot dog or beef you u cant go wrong. everything is delicious, the cake shake is amazing if you like chocolate
ive come here multiple times with my family and we all love it! theyre beef is really good. i get their italian sausage every time i come because it is soooo good! their french fries are pretty good too. the atmosphere in the restaurant is friendly and fun and its pretty big too so come with as many people as you want. i definitely recommend this place to all of my friends
try the beef and cheddar croissant with sweet peppers! its my favorite along with the cheese fries.i have tried many items from their menu and have been satisfied with every single one.
whenever we pick someone up from the airport this is the first place we bring them. love the burgers and italian sausage. the french fries are awesome.  never had a bad experience.
omg such an awesome place,  i went with a co worker and we got the hot dogs with everything on in garbage salad and then a mint chocolate chip shake. we also had fries and onion rings and omg everything was me good and this was my first time here
beef sandwich, dipped, with sweet peppers is so good. makes me think back to growing up in chicago. fun place to share with the kids.
hot dog paradise.seriouslywhat could be better than a delicious chili dog on a fluffy poppy seed bun?  when youre at portillos, theres nothing else that compares.  at this point, i think that this is my favorite hot dog joint in town.  this is also my wifes favorite spot for her chicago dogs.lots of seating heregreat service in early 60s diner surroundings.  you have to come here and have a bite.  inside and outside seating available.
how can you go wrong with this place? one of the last few good chain restaurants. go with the combo and the cheese fries. you will not be disappointed.
chicago food at its finest,now i dont have to move back
holy cow was that good food! we just moved back to the east valley and discovered this huge hot dog  italian beef  burger place on the outside corner of tempe marketplace. i love italian beef so i had their combo with extra gravy.ohmygod!im coming back to try everything on the menu, but i may end up just getting the combo again. because meat party in my mouth!
italian beef is a chicago staple, and there is a reason for that. delicious beef sandwiches and the salads are surprisingly great. get the chop or the poppyseed. goes well with your beef sandwich and hot cheese fries : the free muffin is actually pretty delish too!
visiting the phoenix area, i was pleasantly surprised to see a portillos restaurant, one of my favorite stops when im in chicago. this location doesnt disappoint  food and service are excellent. a great value, i had two jumbo hotdogs, fries and a large coke for just over 10. waited maybe 3 minutes for my order, and as usual the hot dogs were nothing short of amazing. i recommend the jumbo dog, if you arent familiar with chicago style hot dogs...they come with onions, relish, tomato, mustard and very hot sport peppers. if you dont like any if those ask to have them left off. also, try the italian beef, there is none better.my only complaint...and a tip...avoid the small parking lot by the entrance. it is a tight squeeze getting in and out if there. plenty of parking in the general shopping center lot with less hassle.
i tried something new and i am so glad i did. the beef  cheddar croissant is the most delicious thing evar! i cant even. nommmmm.
ate at one in chicago a few weeks ago and was glad to see there are two in the phoenix area. the standard chicago dog with everything tasted just as good. tried the italian beef and was juicy and tasty. a welcome addition to the area!
combo sandwich with mozzarella and hot peppers, with cheese fries and great iced tea!  as good as chicago!
so glad we decided to try this place!  the hamburger was good but the big winner was the italian strawberry shortcake and iced tea. perfect for a hot summer day!!!
great service and great food. the hot dogs are juicy and the salads are fresh. i have gone there twice and loved it both times.
the name says hot dogs but that is like calling squaw valley  a place with snow. best italian beef sandwich this side of chicago and the ladies in my office vouch for the good salads. the milk shake is a sold b, but the onion rings are top notch and not to be missed. clean and a good staff.
great food! exceeded my expectations when i found out i was meeting a friend at a hot dog restaurant. i will be going back and i will be spreading the word about this place!
went to portillos in chicago and found one nearby. super beef sandwiches, salads and fabulous hot dogs. great atmosphere for kids and families. highly recommended.
great place if you like chicago style food, i lived just south of chicago for over 30 years and now live in phoenix.  i love going to this place. the chicago style hot dogs are amazing. everything there is great.
i grew up, well later in my life but many many years of enjoyment here! my favorite is the  beef sandwich and i loved the pasta, unfortunately they did not bring the pasta to their 2 arizona locations but we will live. also love the polish, a maxwell street favorite that my grandfather sold at his deli when we was 13 years old working for his dads deli on maxwell street!  happy to have a touch of chicaholand in the valley of the sun!
originally from chicago and have eaten at almost all the portillos.  must say it is as good as the chicago locations....everything is good there, but the beefs are the best.  love it.
id never have imagined finding a midwesternchicago staple so far away from the midwest! this az location is set up exactly as the other ones id been to in the chicagoland area  you can see everything done behind the counter, the lines and tables are the same, etc. thankfully when i met up with one my friends here the lines were nonexistent and it wasnt terribly busy. first things first  gotta order a cake shake! she wasnt aware of their existence, so at my insistence she ordered one  hallelujah! i also got a plain hotdog with peppers to liven things up, and i knew a cakeshake wouldnt hold me over until dinner. the employees were nice, the place was clean, all wonderful. cannot wait to return for a more proper chicago meal.
this place is amazing. my friends wanted me to try this so i did. i got 2 hot dogs with fries and their chocolate cake shake. the hot dogs were one of the best ive had and i loved the crinkle cut fries. i added ketchup, mustard, tomatoes and onions and honestly it was all on point. i was not disappointed. the price is fair too. not too expensive. next time i will try their burgers.
i was pretty hesitant to step foot in portillos the other day wmy work colleagues, because im not a huge hot dog fan. but to my relief, they do offer other items such as hamburgers, sandwiches and salads so i did actually cross over portillos threshold.their space is fun with lots of neon signs and other knickknacks to peer at while ones stuffing their face. everyone had a smile on their face and worked efficiently. i had their breaded chicken sandwich wfries. fries were soso, as they seemed to be the crinkled ones from a bag of ore ida, but still lightly fried and hit the spot. my sandwich was great; not too much breading and wonderfully seasoned! i do wish they offered to go condiment cupslids instead of the dinein paper cups for ketchup, etc. youll need to ask them for sealed packets!im so glad we stopped here!
i wanted to write this review and just repeatedly say get the italian beef dipped with hot and sweet peppers. with that being said dont forget the cheese fry and chocolate cake shake. ive had the ribs delicious, tamale delicious, hotdogs delicious and a lot of other stuff which all was delicious. with that being said get the italian beef dipped with hot and sweet peppers. it will change your life for the better. lastly, this is exactly the same as in chicago. i thought for sure there had to be a difference but i was wrong.
being a chicago native. nothing can beat chicago food. this and als beef in north scottsdale will give you best italian beef sandwiches in az. this is a must visit for good chitown food
love this place. great atmosphere and yummy hot dogs. my dad loved the old fashioned feel.
this place is the real deal chicago style. i was born and raised in chicago so i know what the food is supposed to taste like. i love the italian beef and maxwell street polish!
spending half my life in chicago i am used to great italian beef sandwiches, chicago dogs and fries and this hometown chicago chain never disappoints! my husband and i love to hit it after a day of playing paintball.  my husband gets the combo sandwich with italian beef and sausage but i stick with the dipped italian beef. their maxwell street polish is great as is their fish sandwich.  and if you are a chocolate lover get a piece of the cake to take home youll be too stuffed to eat it there. glad to have some real chicago food out here in arizona!
if i was ever on death row and had to chose my final meal, it would be portillos italian beef, dipped, with mozzarella and sweet peppers and a side order of cheese fries. ahmayzing. the taste of back home that my soul craves.

awesome. love the speakeasy concept. great drinks. great place to come, kickback and relax.
le 4e mur takes the secret drinking spot to a new level.  its modeled after the speakeasies which became popular during prohibition and it does that very well.  in summer they also have a terrasse which is hidden from the street and feels very secluded.  they make some excellent cocktails which may seem expensive but they are strong so you get value for your dollar.  there is a small food menu but make plans to eat elsewhere because its mostly snack food so it wont fill you up.  getting the address is very easy.  all you have to do is visit their website and register.  they will then proceed to send you the address and instructions for how to enter.  the only question is will you figure out how to enter the bar?
this place is every bit as good as any quality cocktail bar in new york. it would be a popular, thriving destination even if relocated to orchard street or greenpoint avenue.for the past 15 years, my girlfriend and i have been enthusiastic supporters and patrons of many of nycs best cocktail lounges, including milk and honey rip, sasha, attaboy, employees only, the dead rabbit, dutch kills, little branch, end of the century, the mayflower, white star, up and up, death and co, and on and on.just like the best of those joints do, the boys at le 4e mur get the many details just right: the service, atmosphere, decor, music are well done. but most importantly, they make a great cocktail. our visit to le 4e mur was the highlight of our trip to montreal.
le 4e mur the 4th wall was among my best bar experiences in montreal. im from ny and decided on a solo spurofthemoment trip to montreal. on my first evening, people on the streets told me to go to la distillerie. i met two amazing bartenders there who pointed me out to this place, le 4e mur only a few blocks away. its a hidden place though right off the main strip, and if one has been to those type of hiddenspeakeasy bars you will definitely spot it. good luck.now the experience and the drinks:my bartender, sorry mixologists, for the night was eddy  one of the best there is. i told him where im from and that im brand new to the city and just exploring it, and he went well beyond making me feel welcome. he made me some of the best drinks ive ever had and he gave me the insider names of some of the other best bars in montreal. the bar is absolutely first rate and holds up to many of the bars here in nyc  from the decor, the drinks, the service. but this is always remain one of my favorite bars because of the people. 6 mixologists started this place and you can tell how much heart it has. many great bars in nyc have lost that heart and gave in. i hope when i come back to le 4e mur in the future, i can still sit down and have a shot and a hearty conversation with those 6 mixologists.
montreal never ceases to amaze me. my infinite affection for this city only grew once i was ushered into this super dope speakeasy. the cocktail selection is pretty decent, though the space is somewhat limited. overall however, very impressive.you can walk up and down st. denis a million times and never know this spot exists. definitely my type of place and a must visit, especially if you enjoy wowing your coterie with hip spots around town.sante!bean
i heard about this bar on a few montreal blogs and decided to check it out on a saturday night after seeing a long line outside nearby bar la distillerie. the entrance is unmarked, so of course i walked by twice before i found it. there was a bouncer in front of the door and he let us in. the vibe is very prohibitioneraspeakeasy, with dark and stylish decor. its the kind of place you want to sit and stay a while, and service was professional and on point. it reminded me of bars like pdt in new york, but without any pretense or attitude. the place was busy and there was a good mix of people, young, old, francophone, anglophone, some very casual, some very dressed up etc. the cocktails i tried were delicious and priced quite reasonably around 1114 each. i could see a place like this in toronto charging way more. the red lady was a vodka based cocktail that was pretty fruity and sweet. i preferred the other cocktail i tried forgot the name which had gin, tea, egg whites, vanilla... excellent presentation. each drink comes with a garnish, for eg. one cocktail came with a teainfused mini madelaine cookie, another came with a tiny cone of popcorn. the drink menu is pretty extensive and im sure if nothing speaks to you, you could ask the bartender to come up with something to your liking. there are burlesque shows on saturdays and some other nights. on the night i was there, it started around 10:30pm with long gaps between numbers. i think they often collaborate with a dance school called arabesque. the vibe was classy and fun. there was even a clown number arabesque has clown classes apparently. the mc joked it was like their own little cirque de soleil:p le 4e mur is definitely a hidden gem in montreal and a win in terms of service, ambiance, and interesting cocktails.
just exactly what i needed. an attorney with an honest approach and relentless. my confusion and anxiety were handled with a confident smile. mr. albees council in my case was priceless. i felt at ease and even enjoyed some laughs during a highstress point in my life.highly recommended to anyone, family, friends and fellow yelpers.
mr albee is accessible and answered my questions when i called.
this lawyer goes the extra mile for his client and does everything possible for the clients case. mr. albee is upfront and honest in his consultations and advice. he is also reasonable in his fee and goes that extra mile without charging you for it. that is refreshing in a field of lawyers that like to run up bills and overcharge. mr. albee is not like that. he gives great advice and representation and he will fight for you too! i always recommend him; he does such a great job.
if you are looking for an awesome twist on asian fare you find the right place. they even have a roll with tempsura fried banana and lobster!  they have great noodle and rice bowls too. i was there for happy hour and had that roll and one of their hh drinks! !  a cocktail with soshito peppers vodka and yuzu juice. amazing all around. coupled with an attentive staff and great atmosphere, you need not search any longer for a great destination for lunch or dinner. check it out! !
best sushi in the burghif you are looking for great service, chill atmosphere and amazing food, look no further!my husband and i stumbled upon this hidden gem last night and had one of the best dining experiences weve had in a while.pan has a great selection of craft beers on draft, and an extensive wine selection.we started off with the edamame w truffle soy sauce, angry snapper pan maki which was to die for and the lobster monkey pan maki.for our main dishes we had the drunken noodles w scallops, and the hanger stirfry.we sat at the sushi bar and it was nonstop entertainment from start to finish.this will be our go to sushi place from now on!

had a fabulous meal at pan. i had the drunken noodle bowl and the kuro buta belly. both were amazing but the purees that came with the pork belly were truly memorable. i cant wait to go back and try more.
this new restaurant is exceptional at all levels, from service to the quality of food. the drinks were amazing as well! the sushi rolls were made to perfection, and happy hour at the bar offered a great variety of choices.
our second time to pan. the sushi is the best i have ever hadfresh and wonderful flavor combinations. we loved the lobster and green rolls. the bowls are unique twists on asian cuisine. today we stopped in for sunday brunch and pans take on eggs benedict and hash were phenomenal. cant wait to go back!
spent a happy hour on the patio and the drinks, food, and service were fantastic! all around we had a wonderful experience the food was so flavorful! we ordered the spicy tuna roll only 4 during happy hour! to start then had their chang mai chicken plate and the special bowl i believe it was pork belly the house reed curry and bok choy. yum! there were such great flavors in the food without any overwhelming heat. since it was happy hour we two of the diamond vodka special drinks, peppered diamond and sparkling diamond, and they were both delicious!  on top of great food and great drinks our serverchristina maybe? was so wonderful! perfectly attentive and answered all of questions!we will definitely be back soon! cant wait to try out the brunch menu!!!
such a great place! i recommend starting with the  year of the mule cocktail...very tasty. the dumplings and tempura shrimp are great starters but my hat is off to the edamame...the truffle soy makes this an incredible dish. the drunken noodle bowl was also very good. the staff is friendly and service was wonderful. i cant wait to go back and try more!
short review:their sushi ranks as one of the best sushi places in pittsburgh. this is what you need to know. stop reading this and go eat. i went with a large group of friends so we could all try a little bit of everything.full review:sushi: very fresh with interesting combinations of flavors, the very definition of fusion sushi done perfectly.my favorites were the seared scallops with coconutlime sauce and the peppered tuna with smoked jalapenomango sauce. the only bad thing i can say about their sushi is that the rice falls apart easily. but seriously, the flavors are so well thought out and perfectly compliment each other. the scallops were meltinyourmouth tender and tuna was fresh. i actually recommend trying the sushi without any extra soy sauce. i feel that the creativity of the rolls were perfect on their own.small plates:shrimp tempura: fried to a nice crisp without feeling heavy. the sauce was delicious and not too spicy. this was the first thing that came out for us and we knew that this was going to be a great food experience.pork belly: the pork belly itself is well seasoned and melts in your mouth. however, they do provide some fried buns to go with it that i felt was unnecessary. i usually like having normal buns, which cuts through the extreme fattiness of the pork belly.service:fantastic. extremely happy workers. seriously, good food made better by happy staff.overall. i absolutely enjoyed my experience. i think what they do best is their sushi. i will be coming back here soon for their happy hour.
lazy sunday, wandering butler street for a spot to eat. stopped in here to find the best dining experience ive had in recent memory. the server was extremely personable and made some excellent recommendations. food blew us all away. the music was surprisingly noticeable, with enjoyable selections. cant wait until our next visit! 5 stars doesnt seem enough!
great food.  must check out the downstairs patio and upstairs!
the ambiance was great! the sushi was fantastic and the meal was incredible!  the cheese cake dessert was to die for!  came for my girlfriends birthday and was blown away! we will definitely be back again!!
this was our second time going to pan in the last 8 days.vto be honest, i normally like to read reviews on here before checking out new places, however, pan was an exception and i was so glad for that! i am literally shocked at some of the reviews on here because everything about that restaurant is amazing! when my boyfriend and i went there the first time, we ordered hanging tender  hanger steak, which was cooked to perfection rare as it supposed to be and a pork belly plate. pork belly was absolutely devine with this out of this world ginger puree. ive never had ginger puree before and, to be honest, it was so good id rub that stuff all over myself i know, tmi. while we were waiting for our order, one of the chefs brought to us a spicy tuna and avocado appetizer dish, free of charge. i am not sure if the name of it, but it was quite delicious. we also had drinks: asian fashioned, thai tonic, and straight up gin martini. they also were pretty good, asian fashioned wasnt my favorite tho.last night we went there again. this time we decided to split cheeks bowl. the size of it was good for two people. at the first sight, it looked like a pad thai dish, but flavors were so much more mature with a nice kick to it. for drinks, i had a year of mule, which had an interesting spin on the standard moscow mule, as well as lemonlime gin martini wasnt on the menu, bartender just whipped that out because of my preferences for nonsugary drinks, and it was outfreakingstanding!, and my boyfriend had asian fashioned and lemongrass mojito. once again, we were approached by one of the chefs who offered to us a pumpkin cheesecake, on the house. it was to die for! and that comes from a woman who doesnt even like pumpkin flavors.pricewise, the place is definitely inexpensive taking under account the quality of products and the attention to detail. just to compare, we went to a quite pricey restaurant at omni hotel in downtown 2 weeks ago, and one of the dishes we had there was hanger steak that costed 30. hanger steak from pan was only 14 and it was, by far, way more superior in flavor and preparation than the one at omni.all and all, i cant wait to go there again. i am so glad this place is in my neighborhood.
have been a few times, most recently this past weekend. had a great experience beginning to end. service was attentive and friendly, food was good, music was not too loud. the tempura shrimp appetizer is a standout, and the pho was good too. other reviewers have noted issues with food and or service but this was our third visit and was solid. both the host and head chef stopped by the table to ask about our experience, so maybe theyre looking to right the ship. well definitely go back.
last week i bought a groupon for the new restaurant pan to celebrate my friends heather and ben getting engaged. i wanted to go some place that was close in our neighborhood but a bit fancy. i have heard good things about pan from nextdoor and from other lawrencville friends so i thought it would be a nice place to celebrate.  it is nice when the first time you get to go to a restaurant you get to save some money too! the groupon was 40 for 80 dollars worth of food. really i was a little hesitant because i didnt know if 80 would be enough for 4 people, boy was i mistaken. i made a reservation on opentable for 7:15. we were promptly sat in the lounge area. my friend came early and was hanging out there and we just decided to stay. they have really comfortable chairs back there and accommodated us by pushing the smaller tables together. at first i was like, ummm....are we really going to eat like this? it turned out to be really fun and a relaxing way to eat. the chairs and the tucked way atmosphere allowed us to laugh and have fun and had a feel that we were in our own little area. how we did food was we just ordered plates and would get them and then order something else. we ended up trying a lot of great things this way and since it was staggered the tables were not full so it was not overwhelming. our waitress monica was really good to us. she had a ton of suggestions and her ideas on substitutions were on point each and every time. our table loved that she was around to offer advice but wasnt hovering. she was awesome. small plates: dumplings: pork, napa cabbage, ginger, sesame, soy.we didnt go crazy and try something that bizarre. we ordered a pretty standard appetizer. dumplings. the dumpling plate came with five dumplings i ate the extra!. the sauce was pretty standard. the dumplings were plump and the filling flavorful. i was surprised that the dough was a bit thicker than i usually have had with dumplings. the thick dough was not a distraction but something different. we liked them. i would say that they were standard and a good thing to order to please a lot of people.pan maki: barely fried shrimp: light tempura, cucumber, avocado, tobiko, jalapeno miso. yummmy. i loved the fried shrimp with this roll. what flavor! this roll was a hit with the table. our waitress monica told us to sub in some spicy mayo. yes, yes, yes. what a good idea. this roll was a little large and hard to handle with the chopsticks wait, is that a bad thing??. i would definitely suggest this roll. it was enough for us to have two pieces each. yum. dragon:eel, tempura, avocado, crab, scallions, eel sauce. this is my go to roll. i love eel. i will pick this roll each and every time. i kind of slipped it in as a choice and didnt ask the table. i know, it was bad of me but it turned out well and everyone liked it. again, the roll was a little bit large, but again not a problem. very flavorful and i loved the eel. even though dragon is my go to i really think that i would want another of the barely fried shrimp. weird! i really enjoyed that roll....i kind of want that now. meat plates:korean fried chicken: fried chicken, wasabi slaw. this was awesome. the fried chicken came in three large thigh pieces. boneless. thank god. the boneless kind was awesome because we cut the pieces in half and each got a half and then a quarter. the chicken was fried to perfection. perfectly crispy and so juicy on the inside. the sauce was spice and a bit sweet. i liked to just get a little bit more on my piece and would just rub my chicken piece on the plate...i was not the only one that needed more of that goodness. the wasabi slaw was also on point. we all kinda wanted more of that. it had a lot on the plate, but another scoop for us would have been nice. it was great and crunchy. awesome! kuro buta belly: schezuan braised pork belly, butternut squash, buns and a little tomatoonion with balsamic vinager drizzle. monica suggested us to make a little sandwiches with the pork belly and the squash. this was a great idea. the pork belly was a large square that covered the half of the bun that we each got. i made my little sandwich with some oniontomato and the squash. i will say that that squash was surprising and delish with the pork belly. the squash was something that i enjoyed so much that i kept on taking swipes at it. these little sandwiches were really good. i think that pan had some of the best pork belly that i have had in a really long time. the slices were thick and large. the schezuan sauce was not salty and had a nice mild flavor that did not overpower the pork belly. get this, you will not be disappointed. bowls: chang mai cauliflower: thai aromatic rice, roasted cauliflower, brussel sprouts, crispy tofu, coconut  red curry sauce. . monica suggested we sub chicken for the tofu. do it. we needed more meat in our life. this was something that i let someone else order and then looked at the menu a
pan was awesome! great atmosphere, food, staff, restroom. nice open kitchen, i thanked the chefs, and server. started with roasted vegetables and kale with sesame ginger sauce, then green pan maki roll, soy paper wrap, cucumber, avocado, seaweed salad. then korean fried tofu with the best housemade kimchi ive had in a whilespicy!. with the chang mai cauliflower we had a filling inexpensive, delicious vegetarian meal. highly recommend for plant and animal eaters alike. great place! pan has an awesome app and website. check it aht!
just saw this show with my wife tonight and we could not wait till we got home to post a review. we both went into this show not knowing what to expect and we were blown away.  the actors and actresses display great passion and you could really feel their emotions. it amazes us how they integrated three stories into one show. there isnt a bad seat and expect to allow your eyes to wander so you see the action on and off the stage. this is a nice gem the mandalay bay has. i hope it is a success.
this show was amazing. we sat right next to the stage on the side and next time i want to be in the middle. the mash ups of the stories  songs were done so well and the talent all of them was spectacular spectacular! i am happy to know it is here for the long run and will be bringing back all of my friends! cheers to musical, broadway, dance in las vegas and what a great use of the space at light night club.
satine and christian, romeo and juliet, daisy and jaystarcrossed lovers destined to sad endings all.i am a huge fan of baz luhrmanns movie moulin rouge and i also enjoyed his version of the great gatsby.  when i saw that this show was opening, i bought a tickets and attended last night.  i was blown away by the talentgreat singers, dancers, a fine small bandall making for a very fun show!there are a couple of things with the theatre that make the staging both good and bad depending on where you sit.the largest part of the 100 minute show focuses on characters from moulin rouge.  before the show begins, christians typewriter is center stage waiting for him to sit down and start writing his love story of his time at the moulin rouge.  from there, the show mixes parts of luhrmanns romeo and juliet and his great gatsby.  since the show is performed in the light nightclub, the seating and staging are very different from most shows.  the room is wide but doesnt have a whole lot of depth as its set up for the show.  there are two runways that come out into the audience and there are stairs in the middle of the floor seats.  throughout the entire show, performers move up and down those steps and the stairs in the nightclub seating area also.  there is action going on throughout the entire nightclub area at different times.  you have to turn around and look behind you at times to see some action and if youre in a booth facing the wrong direction, youll have to turn around.  such are the limitations of doing a show like this in a space designed for another purpose.  my seat was against the right runway and i was very pleased with where i sat!songs features from moulin rouge are: sparkling diamonds, your song, elephant love medley, come what may, el tango de roxanne et. al.  the costumes were well done and it was interesting to see juliet wearing angel wings.photography is welcome as long as you dont use the flash.  video is also permitted.  this show could easily become my new phantom.  i will have to return and return to enjoy this music and the stories that are so good!if you have not seen moulin rouge, id recommend watching it before coming to this show.  if not, watch it after youve seen the show and things may be a bit more understandable.  and note, you must be 21 to see the show.  unless youre a gray hair like me, youll be carded before entering light!bazvegas
wow!!! i am not going to lie, when the show first started i thought to myself theres no way anyone can do these 3 great movies justice. i was completely wrong. the cast was absolutely phenomenal! what i found so amazing about the entire cast was how they could completely change character in a blink of an eye and all of their voices were incredible. if you are a fan of bazs moulin rouge, the great gastby andor romeo and juliet or just have an appreciation for great talent, this is a must see! the only complaint i have is that the venue isnt the best for this show, if you are sitting on the sides you will not be able to see certain parts of the show so make sure you pick your seats in the middle.
loved this show and my 4 girlfriends, who did not even know they were going when i brought them could not stop talking about how great it was after.  vocal and dance performances were amazing. creative off the charts.   i was a afraid to take the risk and bring others along because it was so new, but very glad i did.  we sat on the second tier off to the side.  i think the best seats seem to be second tier right in front of the bar.  the show was continuous drama with no pause.  the waitress never came by to take our drink order and everyone was too glued to their seat to get up to the bar thats a good thing.  i wont blame drink service on the show, but i hope the management gets its act together, because it would be a shame if small things like that would keep the show from being a success.  if the club wants to make some money from drink orders, they need to figure that out.  drink prices were as expected in vegas.  also the promo video and video posts on the internet are not very good.  the reason i gave it a go was because i heard it was a hit in la.   i miss rose rabbit lie, and this was another but very different try to do something similar.  this was much more theatrical than rrl.  its more like a funky musical with world class talent in a more intimate setting.  also ive never seen moulon rouge or romeo  j, ive seen gatsby but i was able to follow it.  the movies were my girlfriends favorites.
all the accolades this cast, crew, and production team are getting are well deserved.  the cast is crazy talented, the writing was spoton, and the use of the theater and space was very clever.  these 3 baz luhrman movies moulin rouge, great gatsby, romeo and juliet were masterfully retold for the musical theater.  i could easily see this show on broadway actually and would probably do very well!  this was a high energy show with incredible vocals, a tight live band, and a few really talented dancers.  its heavy material not exactly uplifting and perhaps writing in a bit more humor would ensure an even longer run. i would encourage anyone considering this show to go! sit anywhere  the cast uses the entire space.
incredible incredible show!!!! i cannot believe this show is getting shut down and has been poorly promoted. it was an outstanding show. fabulous talent and up close and personal immersion into the show. honestly one of the best shows ive seen in vegas. see this if you can!!! i wanted to bring people back to see it and am so sad it is being discontinued.
this was an awesome show! baz is my favorite director. i really enjoyed how the movies and their songs and storylines were all mashed up together. it worked geat. the energy was fabulous and the venue was perfect, small and intimate. id totally go see it again :
my fiance surprised me with this show for our date night and it was absolutely amazing! i had not been to a life performing arts show in years and this one blew me away! it has all of the great love stories wrapped up into one and they do a beautiful job of seamlessly molding them together! great job!
use this company!!!  i needed some drywall work done when my kids put a huge hole in my wall.  daniel was able to repair this quickly and efficiently and it looks like nothing happened!  i also recently needed assistance with putting up an above ground pool and was referred to integrity home services.  daniel was extremely professional, quick, honest, and extremely fairly priced.  i also had many honeydos that never got done, and he also took care of that building furniture, washerdryer repair, etc..  he is extremely knowledgeable and i will not call anyone else for my household repairs!
daniel came and did a lot of small projects around my home. he was very professional, and worked hard. i was very nervous because of the hacks in vegas, but he was amazing! i will call him again and will refer him to everyone i can. such a relief to have a handyman that can be trusted!
our experience with integrity home services was wonderful. i were amazed at how quickly my projects were completed and finished exactly as i asked. the quote was accurate and under my  budget. thank you and you will be hearing from me again.
daniel came and did a lot of small projects around my home. he was very professional, and worked hard. i was very nervous because of the hacks in vegas, but he was amazing! i will call him again and will refer him to everyone i can. such a relief to have a handyman that can be trusted!
great service! daniel is very professional and thorough. would highly recommend his services.
daniel is the best. renovated an existing kitchen cabinet in order to place a large microwave in it to look custom built. excellent service, honest clean, would definitely hire again. reasonably priced and knows his stuff. use him, hes wonderful.
daniel provided fast, high quality service.  he absolutely went above and beyond.  my front door was kicked in late one night and he had it secured the next day.  he then took care of every aspect of getting the door replaced as soon as possible.  this was a great experience.  he called after each visit to ensure that i was happy with the work.  i am confidant that he conducts his business with the utmost integrity.  i highly recommend him.
daniel was great!  he was punctual and professional. he went above and beyond with the work he did in myhouse. i would definitely recommend him.
i was very pleased with both the quality of the service and the customer care provided by daniel.  he returned my initial call in the same day, was very prompt on the appointment time and the work he did was very good.  i believe the pricing is quite fair.  the next day, i even received a followup call to make sure i was satisfied.  it was an great experience and far exceeded expectations as weve tried other similar handyman services and have been very disappointed.  i would definitely recommend!!
too bad i can give only 5 stars.  daniel deserves 10.  while performing an outdoor job for one of my neighbors, a flying rock accidentally hit my patio door, causing it to shatter.  daniel came to my door, introduced himself, took full responsibility, and stayed involved every step of the way as the door was repaired at his expense.  integrity is not only a part of the business name, it identifies the fine man who owns the business.  highly recommended.
highly recommend. very professional and courteous. ill be using integrity for all household repairs.
daniel is my handyman of choice.  he is very professional, timely, courteous, dedicated to excellence and does quality work.  i have used him on numerous occasions to make repairs and updates to my new home, to include: painting, bathroom remodel, and various repairs.  you cant go wrong with integrity home services!
daniel is great! he helped my husband and i with a remodel project when we didnt know where to begin. he is honest with fair pricing and has been very responsive. we will definitely use him in the future for our home needs. a!!!
integrity daniel has been the greatest help i could ask for ..  he was ontime everyday, did professional work, was courteous and kept me informed of the whole process.  i even got progress emails and  his rates were very fairly priced ..  i would recommend daniel and his services to anyone ..  integrity is more than just the name of his company ..   his  pride of ownership  really shows in his company and his work  ..
daniel extremely prompt and precise!called looking for help to reduce the noise from wind against our bedroom window.  also, to have some curtain rods installed as well.  daniel ended up stopping by same day and did an excellent job.
daniel is outstanding. i had an issue with a sliding door coming off the track several times.he looked at it, told me that the rollers were in great shape and cleaned the tracks for me. once that was finished he adjusted my water heater.he checked out a couple of other home issues which he said were normal and didnt need work on.a dishonest person couldve easily charged me for unnecessary repairs but daniel is an honest business owner. and the work he did do was top notch.i highly recommend daniel for any handyman work around your home or apartment.
im selective when giving reviews, but i feel that daniels handyman services are worth the 5star recommendation.  he was able to adjust my heavy glass shower door by filing down the bottom so that it would open and close properly. though he charges by the hour, hes upfront with letting you know how long the job could take so its still your decision whether you want to go ahead with it or not.  he was creative enough to think of a solution that saved me the huge expense of a new glass door, and he also helped me replace a defective garage ceiling light getting the cover off can be a pain. just ask daniel what kind of home repair or project you need done, and hell tell you if its within his abilities.  hes professional, honest, communicates reliably, arrives on time, and pays attention to details.  he cleans up after himself, and he even said he wouldnt charge me if his idea for fixing my shower door didnt work.  i would definitely use integrity home services again for any other home problems i may have in the future.  from my standpoint, daniel is all about quality customer care and satisfaction so give him a chance and see for yourself!

raul has been our landscaper for the past two years. he is reasonably priced and comes every two weeks to cut grass, pull weeds, etc which helps us not get notices from hoa for having yard issues.  extra tree trimming is needed on occasion and hes always willing to do whatever requests we have.  hes dependable and very professional.
raul and his crew are reliable and take great care of our yard.  they do bimonthly cleanup and pruning.  in over 2 years weve never had a problem in any way.  i highly recommend montoyas landscaping!
raul has been maintaining our yard, front and back for at least a year now. he does an excellent job. we especially appreciate that he shows up on time and is very professional. we highly recommend him.
i actually noticed this place when i was walking along liberty and noticed the produce stand.  on nice sunny days, they put out fresh veggies a large variety of peppers, tomatoes, etc. there a a ton of tomatoes, more peppers, squash massive!, mushrooms, onions, cucumbers, you get the idea. there is also a fridge with fresh spinach, carrots, broccoli, romaine lettuce. the lady that runs the place was super nice and was telling me that they had just opened up less than a month ago and have plans to open up a smoothie bar. so that got me real excited. love the fact that there is a truly devoted place for some fresh, local produce in bloomfield. their prices were really reasonable and boy if you are a tomato fan you will find all sorts of these guys here!  not to mention, they sell ripe avocados  3 for a 1!! their unripened are a 1 each so i would hit this place up if you want to make some guacamole asap.definetely will come back!!
the green market is a perfect addition to this neighborhood.  its the only place i can reliably get fresh, healthy produce.  and im glad they stay open later than most other stores and on weekends!  the selection is much bigger than you would expect from a small space.  thank you gina!
the lady who runs this store is so friendly and sweet. we often stop, great prices on produce and quite a variety of herbs and spices. i still cant get over how much we got for so little . everything is so eye appealing and fresh and flavorful. i look forward to stopping in more often through different seasons, i wish i wouldve discovered this place earlier.
awesome.on time. knowledgeable. professional and reasonable. recommend them to everyone.
the handymannextdoor does great work.  they are always very prompt and get the job done right! theyre  very professional!  kerry is always quick to return calls if he doesnt pick up on the first time! i definitely would hire them again!!!
i have used handyman next door for many projects around my house and they are great! they tiled my kitchen floor. i had them change out the tile of my large master shower and around the large bath tub as well. they helped with hanging 2 new 14ft ceiling fans and checked the improper hanging of 2 other fans from previous owners and rehung them. i have had them paint my house. they helped with replacing 2 sets of poor quality glass doors that were falling apart with uv glass doors. they helped with changing door knobs and locks. some landscaping lights they have helped me with because i am not very good with that stuff. they did some stone work to top my pony walls in front of house and in back yard. they hung a flat screen t.v. on a swing arm in a guest room. today i had to take apart my bathroom drain to clean the plunger and the plumbers caulk came loose in the drain; handyman next door had time this day to come by and fix it for me. better than calling the plumber at higher prices for small stuff. they have also replaced outlets that were wearing out from poor builder grade circa 1999. they are clean and on time. i always communicate with the initial person who i set up the appointment with if i have a question and they always get whatever it is taken care of or answered. i am so relieved to find a service to be so helpful! almost like having sons to help the mom around the house.  almost. thanks a lot guys!
colorfully delicious and absolutely adorable drinks make for a perfect dessert when in vegas. although it is a candy store, the drinks are not overwhelmingly sweet and are easy to drink. i got the 60 oz lollipop passion goblet for 36, which is a fair price for liquid fun on the strip! it is also a great drink to share with great friends, and you get a souvenir goblet to take home with you!!
the drinks were delicious and the staff was very nice. erez the manager has very helpful. i feel in love with the goblet. i would definitely  go back when i visit vegas again.
i recently heard this place closedhope not. yes, it is a little pricey and if you dont like sweet drinkseh, youre probably not going to like it. i really appreciate the different kinds of drinks! its cute! my go to fave is this green apple martini with pop rocks or something of the sorts around the glass rim. the customer service can be a hit or miss...who knows, maybe its the heat. theres been times that weve had a great bartender who thought outside the box for us we wanted to take our drink to go, so they dont have an plastic fishbowl type glasses, she found three plastic cups and put our drink in. and then there was the waiter who clearly didnt want to be there. i recommend sitting either by a window or outside on the patio to enjoy the vegas strip or the people on the strip! ;
the most delicious drink ive ever tasted and for 38 dollars it did the job so i cant complain. im so happy i was able to try it seeing all of the other sugar factories have closed. i loved it and its definitely a treat if youre in vegas
split the massive cocktail between 4 folks and its perfect! our adorable bartender even topped us off which is a rare thing on the strip. overall, a fantastic splurge.
chef nick has been doing meal preparations for me for about 4 months and i am beyond happy with his work.  he personalizes the meals to meet my personal goals and every meal is different.  highly recommend.
chef nick has been my personal chef for some time now preparing literally every meal i eat.i eat 5 meals per day with extremely particular nutritional requirements. preparing these meals requires an incredible amount of attention to detail. chef nick is amazing and seems to handle this with ease.in addition to the food, hes just really easy to talk to when you need to make any adjustments, and hes incredibly reliable.if youre looking for a personal chef in the las vegas area, you probably cant do any better.
chef nick is amazing!!! he has been a huge part of keeping me fit, full and freeing up my time. i get meal plans from him, they are inexpensive and very yummy!!! he is always in a positive mood and i feel his services are well worth it. i havent had a bad meal yet, and when i just dont prefer an ingredient or flavor profile he adjusts with a smile:i would recommend him to anyone with a busy schedule, strict diet or someone like me who is just too lazy to cook. lolthank you chef!!!!
i am very pleased with chef nick. extremely professional and the taste of the entree he prepared for my husband and i was divine!
super fun. go with an open mind. its an interactive show. this is not only for super military super soldiers or call of duty individuals. it can be enjoyed by anyone that wants to have a fun time. fun for date night, parties, work group building activity or even by yourself. i had a blast breaching doors, sweeping the room for intel, moving my team fromthrough combat zones and killing zombies.
first combat simulation i have ever been on as a none military member. its 2 hours. you get geared up. get trained up then put in squad. you search a city for intel and orders to eradicate zombies as you encounter them. sights, sounds and high stimulation by seasoned special forces real deal team leaders. if your a thrill junkie you better get here.
this place is pretty dope. plan to go with a smaller amount of people just for a better experience. we went with a large group of people and found ourselves sharing the lot with everyone. it was still loads of fun, but it could have been more fun with less people. it also looks like this place has just opened, and it seems like all the kinks have been pretty much fixed. i couldnt sense anything going wrong around me. definitely worth checking out!
one word: awesome!!! we were given this as a surprise gift and i was a little nervous that i wouldnt be able to handle the course or he equipment. however, the staff here was super friendly, knowledgable, and fun. they made me feel very comfortable about going into battle.my fiance, whos super into call of duty and zombies, and i were blown away by how realistic everything was. the visual and sound effect were fabulous and a bit scary at times. theres nothing like the sound of machine guns, explosions, and screaming to get your blood pumping. the decor of the course was very detailed and ad to the intensity of the game. obviously, i knew everything was pretend, but in the midst of clearing a various rooms and alleys, our pretend seemed very real. my fiance, fatherinlaw, and i went in with the operator package, which in my opinion is totally worth it. it was super cool to get picket up on the strip in a big badass military truck, change into full geared fatigues, complete the course with real american heroes all the guys there are exretired military, ranger, or navy seal of some sort, and then leave with a dog tag usb filled with pictures of you and your team. the experience was awesome and totally doable for girls, even the pansy ones like myself. i liked it so much that i am seriously contemplating about doing some bachelorette event here, which is also something they offer. cant wait to come back for some more zombie killing.quick tip: come in work out gear. dry fit would probably work out really well. no flip flops allowed, and i would recommend sneakers.
awesome my son went and said it was the best zombie experience in the world ragnarr was a great instructorcommander. next time we will be in vegas we will definitely come back
best experience ever!! it was so much fun .. i got really  scared and excited killing  zombies. .   the staff was awesome.  theyre the best. so nice...!!  they even gave us a ride in this cool adventure combat ops bus   so cool!            definitely something u have to try!
its a great experience and you will have fun killing zombies. if your in vegas and looking for something fun to do, you need to check this out.
too much fun. this puts you in the video game. gear up just like going in to a firefight and train with special forces. then the show cranks up. clear rooms, shoot zombies, jump through window,, hell yes this was fun.
once inside you are greeted by a super friendly staff who is there to do one thing, make sure you have the best experience for your money in all of las vegas. after entry you are brought in to a stagingbriefing room where you are informed of the rules of combat and other legal mombojumbo. now the fun begins you are introduced to your instructortour guide to enter into your zombie apocalypse scenario. you are issued your gear which will vary based on your package but all configurations are exceptional, then a informational run down how to operate and function your weapons. you then break of into groups and are given an informative crash course on close quarter combat cqb scenarios. now your experience begins. i dont want to give away too much but it is action packed from the get go. if you are a gaming enthusiast, gun enthusiast, action junkie and so on this is the place for you. dont waste your money on any other activities in vegas...this is it!
worth it! locals and visitors of las vegas must experience this! no experience necessary! its fun and youll enjoy it! teamragnars
mind. blowing. the aco team is absolutely fantastic, making me feel comfortable and safe the whole time i was sure i was going to get bit by a zombie. its obvious they put thought into every small detail, from the lounge area, mural of postapocalyptic las vegas, pristine retail space and vip zombiekilling vehicles for pickups. once you enter the warehousebattlefield you are immediately thrown into a vivid training camp full of every detail you need to survive. the staff here are not actors, they have extensive backgrounds as army rangers, navy seals, special ops, green beret and delta force ops and tell you about their amazing service. you receive 45 minutes of thorough training prior to entering the battle zone, but even when you step foot onto the arena for your mission, your leader is there at every turn guiding you through every operation. you end your mission feeling an adrenaline rush like no other and ready to do another mission again and again. fully immersive, you are in a whole new and terrifyingamazing world at aco, and it is unlike anything else in las vegas.
there was some miscommunication when making the reservations for my girlfriends birthday. they were so understanding and nice that they upgraded my ticket even though i got it from a discount site. that package included free hotel pick up on their combat truck saving us from that long walk in the desert heat and photos. they also had a surprise waiting for her at the end. the employees are suppppppper friendly and welcoming. i even got to met one of the founders. total thumbs up for a oneofakind experience for gamers and adrenaline junkies.
great experience and very realistic.  starts out with training on weapons and clearing rooms, moving as a unit etc, the the fun starts.  youre taken into a post apocalyptic world to clear houses, find intel and capture terrorists.  the zombies are aggressive and quick, not like the slow movers on the walking dead. we had wombat as our team leader. he was awesome and kept the action moving.  ragnarr was also with us, he was funny and kept things moving by acting as the sweep and making sure no one lagged behind.  the set up is impressive with houses and alleys, littered with debris and junk cars.  were not talking one room shacks, these were like real houses, multiple rooms, kitchens, bathrooms etc.  fully furnished with tvs showing snow, which gave it an eerily realistic feel.  guys pull security while the rest of the team searches for intel.  you can call in an air strike with some impressive sightsound action for an indoor facility.  the neighborhood is large, we cleared a lot of buildings, including cars and a rv.  be warned, its physically intense, youre moving the entire time.  it was also mid august, and it was hot.  we had 1 guy go down from the heat and had to be taken out.  bring water if you can, youll need it.over all a great experience and will be doing it again.  they say its different every time depending on who the leader is etc
this experience was beyond amazing! combatsurvival simulation with real rangers, green berets  navy seals as squad leaders! if youre in vegas you cant miss this, worth every penny! 2hr long experience with training from real combat hardened veterans who lead you through a zombie infested town. you get to shoot, clear buildings, call in air strikes and fight terrorists and zombies with blowback air soft guns that recoil and feel almost like the real thing. took my girlfriend and she loved it, great entertainment for any age. definitely coming back next time im in vegas!
just got back from vegas for my bachelor party, and doing this zombie apocalypse simulation was a highlight. my entire group was buzzing about it the rest of the weekend. its an incredibly fun, highadrenaline experience!as other reviewers have noted, the staff is fantastic. the special ops guys who instructed us  led the raids were great guys with impressive combat experience. also, at the end the fun guys and gals dressed up as zombies mingled with all of the participants, which was a nice touch. these masochists they dress in thickly padded clothes inside a hot building and willingly get shot with airsoft pellets for your amusement are the unsung heroes of adventure combat ops.i dont write a ton of yelp reviews, but the one thing that motivated me to come here and do so was that so many staffers were asking for feedback at the end. i just got the feeling theyre earnestly trying to make something new and cool vegas visitors to enjoy, and i wanted to give them a shout out for that.
what an informative, super fun for everyone! the staff are experts  approachable for qa. i highly recommend this experience when you visit fabulous las vegas!!
awesome training, instructors fun to be working with. tons of zombies to kill. best urban combat experience
a must do when you are in vegas! lots of high intensity fun and the staff is great. i couldnt recommend it enough and cant wait to come back.
first off, im not a gun nut or a huge fan of the zombie motif thats taken over in the past ten years. but this, by far, was the most fun experience ive ever had. to come and get an authentic military experience by ex green berets secret ops soldiers that train you to be tactical unit was cooler than i ever could have imagined. you get ar assault rifle air pellet gun and you clear a neighborhood full of zombies and terrorists. its an adrenaline rush like none other and i want to come back every year and do it again and again.
the most thrilling event ive ever been to! real life combat situations with fun and informative instructors! go team wombat!
i had such a great time with my friends from the downtown podcast! it was a great team building excercise! would definitely recommend it!
most amazing experience ever!!!! whether you are local or visiting this has to be on your to do list!! tip buy the 2 mag package and go crazy!
the place is totally awesome!!! spent the last few hours kicking some zombie ass and having a lot of fun shooting and hearing my friend scream like a little girl. this place is boss!! ragnars the man!!
by far the coolest experience i have ever had! so incredibly realistic! the guides are amazing at training and directing. this is a perfect experience for gun fanatics, zombie fanatics, shooting game fanatics, adrenaline junkies and just about everyone. my heart was racing and i was fully submerged through the entire experience. i cant wait to go again! everyone should try this at least once in their lifetime!
amazing experience. knocking down doors and busting zombies makes a fun vegas day. recommended for anyone willing to man up to take down some undead.
came here for a bachelor party and had an amazing time! the staff was super friendly, and they really got into it. ask for ragnarrrr and wombat  they are awesome. great experience and the best part? you get a workout while shooting at zombies!
awesome staff!  great props!
this was a unique and super fun experience. its more than just laser tag. you learn tactical stuff and while were nowhere ready for real combat...its fun to pretend like you are. its an engulfing experience with the instructors in full character. the zombies definitely scare the crap out of you and its fun having a mission to find the intel. definitely recommend for a special occasion or date night with that someone you really want to impress so you can, ya know, later on in the evening.
the most epic day that my family and i have ever experienced. we did the born adrenalin package for my dads birthdays, and the whole day was action packed. the best way to get out and experience vegas with a fast pass and avoid the bickering of which event to do. if you and your friends or family are a bit of adrenalin junkies and you want the day taken care of i highly recommend this program. at the very least check out their web page and see what cool stuff they provide.
had an amazing time here for my friends bachelor party. great people, great experience. would definitely recommend!
just amazing! it was very easy to get into character and have a great time. great for team building! wonderful staff and set construction.
awesome experience for my close friends bachelors party. this was like a show but we were actually a part of it rather than just an audience. you first go through a brief special ops training and then jump straight into the action.
come, bring your friends, get ready for an awesome experience!!  like the other reviews, they train you then take you through a realistic scenario.  zombies were crazy!!!
came to celebrate bachelor party, and it was a lot of fun. military style gear, the set up and staff were fantastic.
this is fantastic. we went there for a bachelors party of my friend and we had a blast.these are professionals and create a very professional environment. its a gang of people who have spent time in places like afghanistan fighting real terrorists. you get immersed from the very beginning and feel like you are going to be a part of a real military mission. all your senses including smell will feel that you are fighting with an apocalypse.even lobby design given you a good sense of what is coming up.its a unique thing and i have never seen something like that before. go do it and you wont regret at all.
the one stop shop for the ultimate vegas experience. these guys and gals are as professional on screen as they are off. their military fundamentals mandate a backbone and due respect for their comrades and guests alike. highly recommended. hobbit is the man.
it was awesome! the staff is very friendly. you are lead in combat by people having real experience fighting for us army. i went there with friends for a  bachelors party and they had prepared some extras for the bachelor. if this is your first time playing with asg air soft gun have no worries, you will get a crash course on how to shoot and move in buildings. beware that you will get sweaty and your goggles may get foggy for this reason i recommend taking your contact lenses instead of glasses if possible. the whole experience was immersive and thrilling. there were minor things that may upset some a little, like helmet flashlight was out of battery for some people or mentioned foggy goggles, but if you ask me they make the experience more real  shit happens and you still need to deal with zombies one way or another. beware that asg are no toys and friendly fire is not off, for safety reason i would recommend covering as much of the skin as possible or you may leave with a minor bruise.
we just finished the zomvie apocalypse experience, and this was amazing!!!  seriously. i have a few of these type simulatioms under my belt.  any time you go and shoot real life zombies, youre going to have a good time.  so, im just going tobtell you what elevates this experience to the best.we did the operator package, which, yes, is the most expensive.  we got extra combat toys, like sights and lights on our gun, and extra ammo.  plus, they decked us out in camo, picked us up in an amazing badass shuttle, and gave us over 250 pictures on a thumb drive.  everyone nearby stopped when our shuttle pulled up.  its that cool.during the actual zombie murderin, our operator really went above and beyond.  i felt like he was attentive to everyone.  he made sure everyone got turns to kick in doors, radio in to have buildings blow up, and helped when i couldnt change my magazine!  the actors were so into it. ive been to other experiences, where you can see the zombies in your next zone laughing and hanging out.  it can take away from the experience.  not here.  the actors are way into it, and you can tell they love what they do.  i loved everything about this place.  if you are on the fence, do it.  i would have loved even the basic experience package, but we loved the add ons.  youre in vegas!  if youre going to go, go all out.
awesome experience! didnt know what to expect going into it, but turned out to be a blast! fast paced, clearing rooms, shooting zombies, an all around great time.
thats definitely the most fun spot ive been to when in vegas. i went there for bachelors party and i highly recommend it. you are on for a treat! realistic zombie killing is an awesome experience and they do a lot to make you feel freaking terrified which i was numerous times!
i had the best fun i have ever had while in vegas. it was an adrenaline packed experience. if your in vegas i highly recommend coming and experiencing this place.
so much fun, had a blast, highly recommended. well organized, great staff, amazing experience. we of course saved the world, with no casualties. only advise wear drift clothing.
much better than losing at the tables. fantastic time with my group. team leaders are real world warriors you will learn about intercity fighting and tactics. staged zombie scenario very well the fighting felt real. definitely recommend
my husband and i had a lot of fun saving the world from zombies with adventure combat ops. i didnt really think i was going to enjoy this, but my husband was really excited to do it on a recent trip to vegas. i was surprised at the realism of the sets and the professionalism of the staff. we both had a really great time! thank you!
went here for my boyfriends birthday and had a blast! from the moment i got there, i had a great experience. the decor in the waiting room is nice and fits the atmosphere perfectly. after being greeted by friendly staff, our group was taken to a tented area, where we went over some guidelines with gator and wombat, who both have military backgrounds, and fun personalities! our combat officers helped us gear up in vests, helmets and an airsoft guns, and then began to teach us how to clear rooms and what to look for. after that, they took us to the next area and we began our experience. without ruining too much, ill just say the setting is perfect! everything had a zombie apocalypse feel, and the zombies were great actors. the whole experience was roughly 2 hours i think, but i can assure you its worth every penny. after returning our gear staff approached us about our experience and asked what they could change or add to make the experience better. honestly, i loved it and cant think of any changes it would need. make sure you bring a tip for your officers! gator and wombat are amazing and my only regret is i didnt have cash on me :
worth every penny and highly recommend it. you are split into teams of three and then was given an alpha and bravo team. then the fun begins, 2 hours of fun and interaction: learning the drills, shooting, entering the rooms, proper way to use the gun, reload, aim and fire. you are given a mission to find the intel. once prepped you enter in the battle field. you go through about a dozen plus building clearing every room and killing zombies. again its worth it.
awesome time. intense and i now feel better prepared for the zombie apocalypse. run by quality folks
wasbat and gator were our team leaders for the day, they were both incredible! i was part of a large group of female veterans who came in this past friday to shoot some zombies and save the world from a sure apocalypse! i was on wambats team. we were trained on how to enter and clear a room rather, we brushed up on the training we already had. i am a double amputee and chose to participate from my wheelchair. i was thoroughly impressed with how completely accessible everything in the building was. i was usually the 2nd or 3rd in the room but always ended up watching the front door or the window. it was a simply amazing experience. full of adrenaline, quite a few laughs and many new memories.
ms. veteran america 2015 finalists were on board to experience the ultimate zombie killing experience!  this started even before we got to the location.  we were picked up in a deuce and 12 which was incredible!  and then ushered into the adventure combat ops location where we were greeted by professionals  we see you jax  army cst!!...it was great meeting you!!  then, we met our operatives!  operative gator and operative wambat!  both special ops veterans  so we knew we were in good hands!  being that all of us ms. veteran america are veterans  this felt right at home....except for the zombies!  they  were awesome!  we sweated out our hair and that was fine!  we unleashed some major damage on zombies and no one was hurt!  we certainly appreciate the experience and wambat and gator were consummate professionals  we enjoyed it immensely!  well be back!ms. veteran america!
just went here for my surprise bachelor party day. completely amazing!! great scenario and the team leaders are really funny and make training quick and to the point. the zombies are insane!!! it is a must go, do, and see. dont think it is your average or any above average scare house. zombies rained from the skies and came out of the ground. definitely ready for the zombie apocalypse when it comes because of these guys! next time i visit i am for sure coming back!!
absolutely amazing!!  i can not say enough good things about this adventure.  wombat and gator were perfect leaders and we really enjoyed learning from them.  they are real special ops and they actually teach you military techniques to clearing a room and going about as a team.  this was a dream fulfillment to learn and practice this stuff, it was so beyond cool.you start with a pickup in a badass van and its a quick drive to the location.  it really hypes you up so i def recommend the pickup.  then you get right into the adventure and if you get the commando package which you must get, or the operator you get dressed in full head to toe military garb complete with a realistic feeling gun.  it was so amazing, we all looked crazy cool and it really helped with the feeling of actually being in a fight.then you learn all these amazing techniques which you will use on your adventure and then off to kill zombies you go!the sets were off the chain amazingly done.  everything looked and felt so real, great effects!  both the commanders and the zombies were so into it.  everyone there really seemed to love their job and what they were doing.  you must have at least one member upgrade to operator to get the gorgeous photographs taken by doralynne.  you will want to remember this experience forever and show it off to your friends.my friend group has done 5 room escapes and 2 zombie shootouts and none of those even come close to comparing to this experience.  you must try this, it is one of the most memorable and best experiences ever!!
we came here for my friends birthday and this might be the best thing in vegas!  the entire aco team was super friendly and helpful.  wombat and gator gave us some really professional training in combat tactics, demonstrating how to work effectively as a team and stay alive while taking down the hostiles.  those zombies didnt stand a chance!  ha ha .. actually, i gotta tip my hat to the zombies too .. they were super, good spirited guys who would die in spectacular fashion over and over .. much to the pleasure of myself and my team.  one of those walking rot sacks almost made me shit my pants jumping out of the shower at me, but .. i fragged him.  nothing like a life and death encounter to get the blood pumping! :pthanks aco ... awesome business .. cant wait to come back and find out what else you guys have going on.
hands down the coolest experience!! op team leaders wombat and gator made it so legit and we were laughin at the same time. on top of all that, they were so into makin the experience rad that they amped up the threat level a bit more because there were only three in our group only downfall was we ran out out of ammo!! them zombies were awwwwesome! also, never knew there were parkour zombies, lol  will definitely try and make a trip back just for this place...forget the strip!!
my experience here was amazing. from the gentleman who checked us in to the great photos chelsea took. the operator team leaders are the real deal. they teach you real tactical military training before youre put into the zombie apolocalypse. the experience is real life like. our team leaders were wombat and gator and they did a superb job. they made sure everyone enjoyed themselves and were safe at the same time. this is a must do whether youre visiting or if youre a local in vegas.
my family and i had an amazing time! it was incredibly realistic. you are supplied with body armor and rifle air soft gun. before you start the experience, you are given an hour training from real special op veterans. they show you how to clear houses, stack, look for intel, and most importantly; how to kill zombies!  it was my brothers bday when we went. he is getting ready to deploy over seas soon and i wanted to be sure he had something to remember before he leaves. he had an incredible time and it was a bday experience for him to remember.
had an awesome time at adventure combat ops! all the staff was professional and our leaders had years of military training and real life experiences defending our country. we had an hour of instruction and training that they made fun and exciting. then it was time to search houses and alley ways for zombies and intel. we got to shoot zombies actors and they would fall down in front of us. some were harder to kill than others. they took pictures throughout the whole thing which u can purchase on a dog tag computer drive at the end. the experience was a little pricey but we got tickets on groupon which helped. we were celebrating my sons 22nd birthday and they even sang happy birthday zombie style. this was worth the money. it was realistic with the lighting, radio, music, and scenery. just an amazing experience! ty combat ops!
our team had an amazing time!! they really set the scene for a zombie apocalypse!! the training by gator  wombat was on point...cant wait to go again!!
went with a work group from vegas. it was allot of fun. the only thing i think they need to do is make the orientation shorter so more zombie killing. the end was good where all the zombies came out, took off their costumes and greeted everyone. everyone was really pumped about making us have a great time. its also cool they invite vets out with ptsd etc to have a good time.
in vegas and tired of cirque de soleil shows? adventure combat ops is two hours of nonstop action and fun. go!
great people. would do it every time im in vegas. everyone was very outgoing and friendly. highly recommend.
father  son time!!! what s wonderful experience to remember with my son.  staff did an awesome job from start to finish. very personable, friendly and informative.  these instructors know their stuff... no joke this is s must do in vegas.  i recommend the operative package, which includes the pictures. the pictures came out awesome.  the experience gets your adrenaline going, nonstop action. tactics taught and used apply to real life law enforcement operations.  we had a blast!!! oh and the zombies were exterminated!
truly a must do in las vegas!! i went on a whim with a friend and could not have had more fun. the staff works hard to make it a realistic experience and the effort shows. the facility was very well thought out and the gear was top notch. id highly recommend doing the gear upgrade because it really adds to the experience. the operative team leaders made sure that all participants had an enjoyable experience. make sure you tip them because their enthusiasm and real military background really makes the experience finally, id like to commend the zombies. you can tell that they all really enjoy their job and they put forth the effort to make it a fun and realistic experience. thank you adventure combat ops for ending my las vegas trip on such a high note!! i really cannot recommend this place enough. and thank you to my operative team leader, gator, for a great time.
had a great time, really exciting and fun experience. staff was great to work with and really knew their stuff. highly recommend for a group activity!
i had a great time.  i loved the instruction by the instructors who were actually members of the military.  they prepared us well for the mission.  shooting the zombies and terrorists with the airsoft rifles was a guilty pleasure.  the simulated apocalypse world was creepy and a challenge to navigate and accomplish the mission in.
we came, we killed some zombies, there is some room for improvement, but over all great time, the operator gator was by far an amzing operator that was perfect as a character for the venue, from the tatts and his amazing funny personality.   his personality made me laugh quite hard durring the zombie breif, and the girls i brought loved him.  he made the experiance... this will make for a great team on team capture the flag range...
wombat, gator and jax are experienced former combat special operations soldiers.  they actually are your team leaders guiding you through the zombie apocalypse.  you actually feel like your going through it and you get into it!  i know my heart jumped a bit at times just because it kind of brought me back from when i was deployed!  its a two hour event and you are in your feet moving..starting with an operations order in what your mission will be and how to execute.
came here for a bachelor party event.  staff was super friendly, they came and picked us up from the cosmo and gave us a ride back. wombat and gator were true professionals and we are thankful for their service in protecting this country.  there are no words to explain this experience.  it was such an amazing time and adrenaline rush.  the zombies kept you on your toes the whole time while clearing out buildings.  this is a must if you are with a large group. a great team building and camaraderie experience.
had a outstanding time going thru and killing zombies. this is a must do in vegas. i defiantly recommend this. the staff are great, and the tier i leaders are great guys... they brake everything down so easy so everybody can enjoy it. everybody has military experience, great to see vets still getting after it. get in and kill stuff.rltw lasvegas specops rangerup adventurecombatops suasponte veterans zombies operativegator
absolutely amazing! i havent had that much fun in a long long time. our team leader wombat was amazing! him and gator made everything easy, simple, and straight to the point! aco is an absolute must to do in vegas.!!!
im literally blown away by how much fun i had. it was so much better than i expected!!! i cant wait to take my brother and sister here for christmas, they are going have the best time ever.
wow!!!!  we always are looking for fun new things to do in las vegas and this activity really takes the cake. as someone who has zero experience with guns or video gaming, i didnt really expect to enjoy this experience and only made the reservation since i thought that it was something that some visiting family members would like doing.  to my surprise, i had a fantastic time and already am planning to take another group of friends here on a future visit to vegas.  we all loved how the team leaders, gator and wombat, really worked hard to make sure that everyone got involved in the action and had a great experience.  in fact, everyone in our group of 5 absolutely loved the experience and thought that it was the highlight of our weekend in las vegas.  if you buy the basic package through groupon or elsewhere, i would suggest that you upgrade to one of the higher level packages when you arrive so that you can get extra ammo and wear the combat gear.  we upgraded one level and it definitely made the experience a lot more fun.  we all were out of ammo by the end of the event, so we were happy to have the extra set of rounds.  the photos from the experience also were excellent.  we bought two sets to take home and have had so much fun going through the pictures.  gator was our team leader and he was perfect.  he made sure that everyone was getting in on the action and kept us all on task.  he also has a great sense of humor!  the zombieland set up is outstanding as well lots of little houses, an abandoned rv, abandoned cars, smoke machines, awesome music, etc.  the zombie actors also were excellent and really kept us on our toes.  you never know when and where a zombie is going to appear!if you find yourself in las vegas for any reason, i would highly suggest that you make your way over to adventure combat ops.  you wont regret it.
unreal experience, the obstacle course was unreal, sound effects the whole nine yards! the boys took great care of us! thank you for an incredible experience that ill never forget!
been to vegas many times, and this was one of those times ill never forget.  had the best time shooting zombies.  gator  wombat were both awsome making it a little real and fun at the same time.  if we had the time, we probably would have turned around and gone a second time it was so much fun.  also was very cool to know that reallife american heros are the ones teaching and guiding you through the course.
best facial ive ever had! 10 out of 10! all homemade products for each customer, it made me feel really special and like she cared about me as more then just money coming in. she was constantly checking on me to make sure everything was okay and i really appreciated that. but i think my favorite part was how homey it felt, it smelled great and was warm and decorated perfect, i just loved it so much. rebooked already. then to top it all off she texted me saying how much she appreciated me and that made me feel great. i love linda and cant wait to go back!
wow! where to start.. im so in love with this place : the facial is truly one of a kind which is my favorite part. linda knows her stuff! she customized everything just for my skin type which isnt too easy since i have problematic skin. my skin glowed and was so clean. she has magic hands and a skill like no other. if youre looking for a facial that will wow you this is your gal. she even gives you a scalp massage before your session is over which is one of my favorite parts. cant wait to see her again and see what fun products shes got in store for me next time. thank you linda for always caring about my skin : ps. the massaging facial table is def a plus :
i have had many facials over the year and lindas organic facial was one of the best ones i have ever experienced !!! she individualized the facial according to my skin type and took the time to explain everything she was using.  hands down she was amazing!!!
absolutely amazing, awesome holistic organic facial plus an overdose of pampering by esthetician extraordinaire and lovely, caring person linda.  your skin is treated to the utmost of healthy vitamins and nutrients specialized to your skin.  lying on the cozy vibrating heated massagetable for your back is delightful.  her treatment room has a sweet ambiance withmini lights and decorations.  she shares with you the products she is applying step by stepand their benefit and is very knowledgeable.  you are in a state of pure relaxation while being pampered from the magic foot serum, booties, massage from tip of toes to top of your scalp!  w o w !!!  linda offers you apple cider and some treats and you leave with a goodie bag not to waste any skin care product that was remaining from your vip facial.   the entire atmosphere of this holistic spa is beautiful.
came here shortly after it opened, hubby and i had been anxiously awaiting its opening as we live very close and love mexican food. i got a pulled pork burrito, hubby got steak and chicken burrito. lots of fresh toppings to choose from, staff was patient in answering our questions. gaucamole was an extra 65 cents to add into the burrito. total came to about 25 dollars for two burritos, an order of chips tortilla chips and salsa which was very mild but yum!, an iced tea and a sangria non alcoholic. we were extremely satisfied with the quality and amount of food and will definitely be returning!
ive been to the pomo in phoenix a few times and never had a pizza that didnt rate 5 stars. luckily the brand new downtown gilbert location is just as good. i came here for lunch on the day they opened today! and chose my favorite, the napoli. fresh, delicious and everything i want from a true italian pizza. friendly service and a nice dining room make this addition to the heritage district restaurant scene a very welcome one. highly recommended.
we came on night 2 of this location being open.  i have been to a lot of opening weeks of restaurants and you never know what youre gonna get.  all i have to say is that is if they are this great on night 2, i cant wait to come back!  the best part of our experience was the bartenders, nikki  tyler.  they were fantastic!  we ordered food and drinks and everything was amazing!  we will be back.
went there today for 1st time, they were super busy yet so accommodating to our request to b seated inside. got a seat right by the pizza oven  were able to enjoy watching entire cooking process. our waiter, jimmy was very attentive, took our drink order  gave us time to look over the menu. we placed our order, appetizer  pizza. excited about our arancini order, when here comes the manager to let us know they were not available... she quickly offered to pay for any other appetizer, actually she paid for two of them!!! we chose  the bruschetta trio  meatballs which they were delish!!!! the entire experience was amazing... other business should learn from pommo pizzeria!!!! cibo e servizio eccezionale!!! sara di nuevo di sicuro.
checked this place out because it was new and fell in love! awesome pizza and really nice atmosphere! not too expensive either. our server was alexa and she made the whole experience great!! her and the pizza are why i will absolutely be back!
this was our first time to poma and wont be the last! all the flavors came together perfectly with the pizza we ordered.  the evoo  i could have drank   so delicious!  for an appetizer we chose the saffron rice balls, equally amazing.  server, mark, was super friendly, attentive but not overwhelming or pushy.  yes, you can get cheaper food elsewhere  but without a doubt, at pomo you get what you pay for and the quality here is top notch.  gilbert, you got it right with this new restaurant addition to downtown!
i live across the street and have been eagerly waiting for pomo to open. i just left and couldnt wait to write my review. so delicious! the ambience is awesome and the food and service are just as great. we ordered bruschetta probably the best ive ever had and 2 pizzas. we sat in the patio and as my nephew was biting into his pizza, he noticed a mosquito stuck in dough. obviously, thats not surprising seeing how we were sitting outside. we told our server about it and asked if maybe we can just replace a slice. they actually remade the entire pizza and didnt charge for either of them! totally unnecessary but they went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. also, they have a delicious peach tea. i cant wait to go back!
beautiful place, amazing food, great service! the pizza is real italian pizza and it is lovely!
this is the place to get pizza that is as close to real italian as it gets. the meatballs were awesome too. they treated us like family and the waitress talked with my wife, who has breast cancer, like they were sisters. she really made my wife feel special. a place we will gladly visit again!
here we go!!!! another great italian real pizzeria in arizona !!!! great food good service.... nice location
downtown gilbert, arizona has just been graced with the presence of one of the best pizzerias in the planet, and its only minutes away from my house. not sure if thats a good or bad thing. the pricing is very reasonable and worth every penny with the quality of the food you order. great flavors with excellent dough right down to the crust. plus, the massive brick oven serves as the centerpiece to a great dinner out at downtown gilbert. lastly, tip your servers well, because the service is some of the best out there!
knocked my socks off!  in the two plus years i have been in az, this is the first time i have said this.when you walk in you see this beautiful gold sparkly italian pizza oven.  the place is very small, only a few tables inside and a few tables outside.  there is a good size bar to sit and  sitting area around the oven you can eat and watch them make the pizzas.the staff is externally well trained and knowledgeable and can pronounce everything on the menu, which is good because i could not.  we started with the mini meatballs. to die for!  its the sauce, all about the sauce, and those meatballs are so good.  do not know why they do not offer spaghetti and meatballs.  next we ordered the bufala verace and the don alfonso pizza, again to die for!!! and we had to get desert, we never do that.  i cannot tell you what it is called but it is a sort of jello, custard,  pudding thing, drizzled with caramel and a strawberry and blackberry.  to die for!!!!  there is no way of describing the taste, you have to try it yourself.glad we went when we did because soon it will be a hour wait.  but still worth it.
i live in chandler and have recently discovered the great downtown gilbert area, which beats our downtown silly for food and things to do! what a pleasant surprise. tonight we tried pomo and its a great addition to the area. my wife had tagliatelle bolognese and gave it rave reviews  less authentic restaurants would smother it with too much sauce, but from what i could see, it was just the right amount. and the peas are an interesting addition. i chose the carpaccio di bresaola, which is arugula on a bed of carpaccio, with parmesan. it was delicious... nearly as good as the exact same salad i had in venice a couple of weeks ago. the only slight changes id make would be to tone down the lemon vinaigrette and add a little more parmesan to offset the pepperiness of the arugula. still, really nicely done. i saw that pomo has an aperol spritz on the drinks menu and went for one of those. its just as good as any youll find in italy. finally, kudos for the level of service. attentive but not fawning. and the mural of the street scene in napoli makes for a great view as you eat.
went to this location for a friends birthdaygroup of 6 on a wednesday. we were seated immediately. id like to start off by saying this is the closest thing to authentic that i have found in arizona. the atmosphere is wonderful and our waiter coincidentally had an italian accent which added to the experience. this place is a little pricy but its well worth it. perfect for a date or leisure meetings. pizza is a good personal size and the trayi forget the name of assorted cured meats and cheese with garlic bread goes great with a glass of wine. do yourself a solid and check this place out.
we have been looking forward to this location opening for quite some time. we had eaten at the downtown phoenix location and it was delicious. it probably wasnt a good idea to eat here on their first friday after opening though. when i called in i was told it would be about an hour and twenty minutes for our party of 8. when we showed up 1:15 into the wait we were told it would be another 67 minutes. after a conversation with an understanding and appreciative manager we were seated in about 10 minutes. im a happy camper. the food was delicious!  their meatballs are fantastic as is the calamari and shrimp appetizer. the pizza though, that will keep you coming back. enjoy but beware of crowds.
one of the best food experiences i have ever had! we had an hour wait, which we knew it would be with being so new in gilbert. once our table was ready, we waited for about 1015 minutes without anyone coming up to us to get drinks. without us complaining, the manager came up to us and apologized right away and told us he was going to take care of us. we ordered a pizza and kale caesar salad. when our food came out, they also brought us their specialty pasta, pasta del giorno, which was amazing!! the pizza was awesome too! we constantly had amazing service all evening. the manager came to check on us frequently. after we were stuffed, they offered to bring us dessert. they brought us panna cotta and tiramisu. i probably would have never thought to order panna cotta had i been the one ordering dessert, but it was absolutely incredible. i will crave it until i go back. tiramisu was one of the best ive had! we walked out with full bellies and big smiles. this place is a must go. even when they are still working out the kinks of a new location, the service and food was well worth the wait!
my husband and i are gilbert locals and frequent the heritage district often. we have been looking forward to the opening of this new restaurant for weeks. we went in friday night and thought immediately it might not have been the best idea with the hour long wait. we decided to stick it out and went to the bar to sit down for a drink while we waited for our table. the bar was very full and we were fortunate to find two seats outside. this might have been or best decision of the night. the misting system was beautiful and dropped the temperature down by at least 20degrees. we sat outside and everyone around us seemed to be really enjoying themselves. the bartenders name was tyler and he was very enthusiastic and talkative with all the customers even while being very busy. throughout the night he would engage and educate all of the customers outside about drinks and the food at once just for fun. he recommended a cocktail that had tomatoes in it. i was hesitant but it ended up being one of the best cocktails i have ever had. we were going to wait for a table but we were so impressed and entertained by the bartender that we decided to stay outside and enjoy the show with our meal.my husband ordered the don alfonso pizza and i had the pomo. both were fantastic and definitely good enough reasons to come back. however, anytime that i return in the future, i will make sure to look for our new favorite bartender in the heritage district before getting a table. this place is a must see!
i love pomo. like to the point that my friends make fun of me. being from the east coast, i love italian food, but im sorry its just hard to find decent quality out here. i found it at pomo. sure, it can get pricey, but i have no problem paying more for great food. service is great, the bartenders were quick to remember my name and have never steered me wrong.
our first time at pomo, but already knew how great the pizza was. had to give it a try, and it was amazing!! the service was awesome jimmy  was our server and was on point!!! will definitely be back!! so glad pomo made it to downtown gilbert ..
pizza was so good! cocktails were amazing! quick and good service will definitely be back!
where do i begin? this place is fantastic and the service is phenomenal. i had called ahead to put my name on the list for a larger party. upon arrival, my name wasnt on the waiting list 2 hours after calling, the staff apologized and put us back next in line. we had to wait an hour extra, but the servers kept coming out to check on us and provide drinks. once we entered to our table, pomo had set up a variety of free appetizers for us as their way of saying sorry, not only that, the waitress that was serving us was probably one of the best that ive had in awhile! the food is incredible, the appetizers were amazing, and the desserts were fantastic. pomo definitely showed us that they cared and i commend them on their respect and admiration towards their customers. will definitely come back in the future! do not miss out on this place.
amazing! certified authentic by the italian government and the napoli pizza association.
my girlfriend and i had been anxious to try this place and we are glad that we finally did.when we arrived, the dining room was on a wait so we decided to sit on the patio.  i am not usually a fan of patio seating but this was rather comfortable.eli, our server, was awesome in every way.  he was very attentive and made some great suggestions.  eli kept our glasses full throughout the meal and whenever we thanked him, he said my pleasure, which was a nice touch.we had the mista, don alfonso, and a nutella pizza for dessert.  all of it was top notch.  we will definitely be back.
had a great time with my fiance last night waiters name was chris b i believe. our waiter was great, atmosphere was great, i got to even show a trick with opening a bottle of wine place is top notch
top notch pizza place!  everything was delicious, staff was super friendly special shoutout to our waiter, eli, who was outstanding!, great vibe throughout and the manager seems like a very nice guy.  i think pomo is a wonderful addition to the heritage district!  well be back!
ok now the first thing i thought was,  oh great all we need in downtown gilbert is another italian eatery and do you know what? yes we most certainly do! this restaurant has some of the most delicious pizza you will eat in gilbert. and for dessert we had tiramisu. now im not a fan of tiramisu but this restaurant knows what theyre doing when it comes to dessert as well. this restaurant its a wonderful addition to downtown gilbert.
having been to the scottsdale location and loved it i was excited to try the gilbert one ! it was delicious with a new nice patio and bar. we had to wait 20 minutes for a table but got a drink at the bar outside. it was hot outside but they had misters on and its pretty comfortable. we ordered the kale salad, meat plate and each our own pizza. cant wait to return!
amazing food, staff, and manager. will be going back again and again. we had the pomo pizza, and the meat balls.. it was so good and the bartender brian made the best drinks!!
umm, delicious! my friend and i tried pomo as i was getting ready to leave arizona and move back to pennsylvania. it was slightly busy we went around 7 pm, but we saw a few seats open at the bar so we sat there. bartenders were extremely helpful and gave us very generous portions for a great price! we split the calamari which was fantastic. we both got pizzas. i got a margherita pizza and yum! crispy, cheesy deliciousness! great environment and atmosphere. loved it! if i were still in az, i would definitely be returning!
been to all of pomo locations.  phoenix, glendale, scottsdale..... this one is my favorite.  beautifully designed restaurant in every detail.  the atmosphere takes you to italy if only for an hour!!  even a good portion of the staff is italian.  great pizza, pasta, antipastos, etc...  great job guys.  gilbert has a real gem....
the service tonight by kato was great and he really makes this place fun and enjoyable to sit at the bar! food is always awesome along with the other bartender who is very handsome! i think his name is alex, he always does a great job greeting everyone with that beautiful smile.
another delicious joint to use an excuse to visit old town gilbert. joining some amazing eateries, pomo is making its mark in stone oven pizzas. the menu has an abundant list of options to make your pie hit the right note for you. visited last night with some friends and had a great experience. the seating was quick, the service was attentive, and the food was delicious. impressed with their fresh bruschetta and starter options. all pasta is fresh and handmade. salads and soups are also entree choices. they have several italian beers on top along with a wine and cocktail list. their fresh brewed peach tea was delicious. our table ordered two pies  margherita and a prosciuttoartichokemushroomolive one. they both were eaten up quickly and the crust was spot on. i ordered a kale romana salad with grilled shrimp. very good, a little dry. kale needs dressing help always. my husband had the pasta. he and i were both surprised how much he liked it. he comes from an italian family and has a wife that makes her own pasta and gravy so he will sniff out the frauds. he loved it and would absolutely go back.
went in with a friend to try the pizza.  nothing short of awesome.  thea was absolutely awesome.  fastest handmade food i ever had.  will absolutely visit here again ... very soon.
great service, delicious food, friendly staff, lovely ambiance.  the pizza was delicious, perhaps the best ive ever had, also had the gnocchi which was great.  the friendly staff was a breath of fresh air after just having been treated rudely at barrio queen.  training your front of the house staff goes a long way!
i came in after waiting 2 hours to get a cold breakfast at liberty market. they took me an hour before they actually opened the food and service are excellent. christine provided a worldclass level of service! i will be back!
pomo in gilbert delivers just as the location in downtown phoenix.   i came here not sure if i would be experiencing the same service and high quality pizza i have come to love from the downtown location.  and they fired on all cylinders without a hitch.  first off, it gets very busy so plan on waiting accordingly 45min1hr.  nice thing is they take your phone and text you when ready so was nice having a drink across the way while we waited.  for the reviews on here about the place being small. well thats what makes it awesome. the downtown location i feel is even smaller but i love the closeness it brings to the restaurant and keeping the feel of downtown gilbert a modern local feel.  the pizza was excellent. quality ingredients with a perfect done crust. the service was just as outstanding  they were extremely busy during my visit, but everyone not just our waitress made sure sure all our needs were met.  i love pomo downtown phoenix and safe to say pomo in gilbert is a hit.
tried pomo for the first time at their new gilbert location.  my wife and i were out for dinner with friends and wanted to try something new.  we had the brucheta trio and the toto sapore.  our waiter was friendly and polite.  he answered our questions about the menu and offered suggestions to help us decide.  it was a busy saturday night during peak hours but the food and cocktails came out in reasonable time.  it took a while to capture our waiter to order a second round but i give him a pass as the place was quite busy. the brucheta was fresh and the pizza reminded us of a trip to europe earlier in the year.  the pizza was thin and authentic itallian cusine. overall the experience was great.  total cost was about 25person and we felt good about tipping generously. tried it again for lunch a few days later with similar results. would definitely recommend.
amazing pizza in downtown gilbert... must have the margherita pizza and the bruschetta too. nice spot to meet friends
as an italian citizen that come straight from italy i have to say this is the true deal.if you want to eat real italian pizza this is the place to go;the crust was perfectly done ,crunchy on the outside,nice and thin in the center.all the ingredients are on point,fresh and tastefull. if you want an american pizza this is not for you!all the names in the menu reflect the same names you can find in an italian menu,from antipasto thst means appetizer to all the different pizzas name ,simple and italian like they are supposed to be.a quik reminder that bread and balsamic vinegar with oil is not an italian thing,so seems legit they dont do that.the waitresses were all super nice,groomed,very knowledgeable and fast.we waited for like 15 minutes and our pizzas were delivered to our table ,hot and delicious. i did ask for a after dinner liquor,classic italian one and my waitress didnt know what it was,but hey not worries i didnt expect for him to have a knowledge of every single italian food,or wine,or beer or liquor.i give this place 5 star,if i could i would go for 10.best place for a real italian pizza,if you complain about it maybe you should just stick with dominos or pizza hut.
i think this is the best pizza i have ever had so far! thin and flavorful..yummy! had tiramisu for dessert and it was delicious.  i took my leftovers home and my boys loved it!
awesome pizza, friendly staff good prices! the downtown gilbert area is nice and this place has a patio that has a great atmosphere. i even brought my two kids 5 and 3 who loved the cheese pizza.
best pizza and excellent service, good location and its a wonderful place, good selection of beer and wine
seriously the best pizza i have ever had! i had margherita pizza and creme brulee for dessert. great service, delicious food, laid back atmosphere. this is my new favorite pizza place! highly recommend!
the peppino pizza is probably some of the best pizza i have had in the phoenix valley.
we went to a farmers market and afterwards needed to grab a bite to eat, we walked down the quaint downtown street and stopped in at pomo.  we had never been nor heard of it but were greeted with smiles and sat promptly.  chris was our server and gave us great recommendations after he learned it was our first time here.  he gave us the low down on how the pizza was cooked as well as the fantastic options we had.  the food looked fantastic as we watched it come out get delivered to our neighboring tables...we were anxious!  it was well worth the wait and the portions were perfect!  thanks chris for the excellent service and recommendations!
i was very impressed by my entire experience. my fiance and i were seated right away, although there were at least 2 dozen people waiting outside for a table. our server was very polite and friendly. he kept our water glasses full, and brought our drinks out right away. he recommended the toto sapore. it was excellent! and it only took the kitchen about 5 minutes to bring it out. the crust was chewy, but with a slight crispness. the sauce was perfect, and the pancetta was delicious. i am the type of person that dunks every bite of pizza in ranch dressing, and sprinkles parmesan cheese excessively on every slice, but, im pretty sure parmesan and ranch would have ruined this pizza. it was perfect the moment it came out of the brick oven.
this was my first time at pomo. it was so awesome! we had the porcini pizza and tiramisu.  they were both so good. i cant wait to go back!!!
great addition to the burgeoning restaurant scene in gilbert. excellent service and delicious food. we got the meatball app, a salad, pizza and a bottle of wine...everything was fresh and yummy!
best pizza coast to coast.   i read all the reports of the best pizza in the country and ate at many of them.   i thought scuola vecchia in delray beach florida was the best.  the sauce and crust at pomo is amazing.
wait was 45 minutes for a table, so my friends and i sat at the bar. great pizza and bruschetta! plus the bartender was very friendly and fun. she answered all our questions and even had the bruschetta cut into thirds instead of halves, so each of us could sample them. :
arincini or rice balls were excellent as an appetizer.  we also ordered the capriciossa pizza which has ham, artichokes and mushrooms which is surprisingly awesome and the vesuvius calzone deep fried. this place has excellent pizza with fresh ingredients.  nice beer selection and wine list by the glass was long.  we had good service
great pizza!  great atomophere and the food ... the food!  i say the best pizza in arizona by far!
went to promo on a saturday night with another couple for dinner. we had a little bit of a wait so we decided to get some drinks and an appetizer at the bar. the bar is very large and very comfortable.  the restaurant itself is fairly small and there is a decent size patio as well. the bartender on duty was very knowledgeable as well as friendly. we got four glasses of wine and a bruschetta plate and it was very good.  shortly thereafter, we were called to our table. once seated, we were promptly greeted by a very friendly and upbeat server. she was also very knowledgeable about the menu and made some good suggestions. we decided to get two pasta dishes and two pizzas for the four of us to share. my husband and i decided on the tagliatelle with meat and peas and a margarita pizza. both were absolutely delicious. our friends enjoyed their selections as well. after our main entrees, we did opt for dessert although i probably shouldnt have because my hips felt it the next day. we had the creme brulee and our friends had the cannolis and both were very good. a few more glasses of wine were also had as well. when we were finished, we walked away saying what a great night it was. food, atmosphere and friends.
this place is amazing!! my husband  i split pizza  lasagna. the pizza was very yummy, and the lasagna was the best we have ever tasted! our child has severe food allergies, and next time we go they will make her a dairy free gluten free pizza as they carry her dairy free cheese! we will be back for sure!!
best little casual italian dining in old town gilbert.  i crave the porcini pizza, thin crust sicilian style pizza with imported porcini mushroom, eggplant parmesan that melts in your mouth and nutella chocolate flourless cake! always great service!
anything stefano touches is absolutely delicious.  this, like the other pomo pizzerias, is the real deal with wonderful napoletana pizzas and high quality ingredients.
pomo pizza is the best napoletana style pizza. it does not compare to oreganos or any pizza place. they make delicious appetizers as well and they have white pizzas and the red sauce pizzas. delicioso!!!
i was delighted to find out that jimmy johns was in delivery distance to my job. after reading the reviews i was a little scared to order from this location. twice! i have ordered twice in the past few days and both times i received exceptional customer service the guy even laughed with me on the phone .., delivery was fast and friendly and quality of food was perfect! no complaints here! i would recommend this location to anyone :
we came here for a team builder, and had an awesome time.this place is nondescript... like seriously, it feels like youre going to need to escape the waiting room. instead, you are led to an intricate study built with such detail that you soon forget the unassuming exterior. the clues are complex and interesting, and the reveals are downright exciting. it requires teamwork and serious thinking, but flows really well overall.they dont leave you in there forever. it took us a little over an hour, which is very fast for this room. if you need help, they will give you clues we did not allow them to, but try to do it yourself.see if you can beat our record of 1:06.
i went with a group of friends and we all loved it.  it challenges your mind and encourages you to think out of the box.  i will definitely be back!
what a fantastic adrenaline filled experience! the staff was very friendly when we arrived. they were great at explaining the rules and providing us hints when we really needed them. you will be given some very well hidden clues to escape a room. definitely accessible for people of all ages, as long as you bring an open, creative mind and a willingness to work with others. i recommend this place to any groups looking for something out of the ordinary to do together. we got to build off of each others strengths and use plain and simple team work.
wow!  we came as a family and were blown away from the very first moment of stepping into the room.  i love the victorian era and this felt like i was transported back in time... what great fun to be exploring in someones study as we figured out clues.  thank you sleuth box  for a fun adventure!!!
such a great experience. we were a little intimidated and didnt know what to expect but they were super friendly and explained the process, even gave us hints along the way when we were feeling lost. it pushed us to think outside the box and work together as a team to figure out clues. i would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something to do on a weeknight with some friends. will be back again to try out the new rooms, even the haunted room theme.
did this for a teambuilder for work and it was one of the best teambuilder activities that i had participated in with our team. the room was challenging and the ambiance was incredible true to its era. highly recommend this for any family or work outing!
i went to the sleuth box for a team builder and it was such an amazing experience. great for working together, and i cant even count the number of times we said wow while in the room. i cant recommend this place highly enough. just an awesome experience. you will only regret not going sooner.
i went with a group of people from work. it was great! i was originally concerned it would get boring or not be that interesting. i was totally wrong! it is so well done. it was interesting the whole time. it was challenging but not so hard that its not fun. i definitely recommend it!
its hard to believe, but true  this is one of the most fun times ive had with a group of complete strangers but very friendly and nice strangers! : our group used teamwork and communication to get through a challenging and enjoyable puzzle room. so much more fun on a date night than your typical ol lets go to see a movie. a special thank you to the owner and staff colton  you made us tourists feel very welcome! :
a coworker of mine recommended this place, so i had to check it out. i was impressed. it is clean, and has a wide variety of choices, yet simple menu. i like that you can choose toppings  such as mango and cucumber. the variety of chickens kung pao, teriyaki, etc.. are delicious. the staff is friendly. recommended :
i got a cleaning for my house party. was surprised i was able to book instantly and have the cleaner show up the next day. the cleaner did a good job and was on time. i certainly did not expect this because the cleaning was just a regular one but she was able to remove many tough stains my apartment management said was part of wear and tear.
i got a cleaning when i was moving out of my place which was dusty and not in the cleanest conditions. but the cleaner was able to clean within the recommended hours and help me avoid a charge. i like how the service is so transparent and convenient. highly recommended!!!!
my roommates and i got a cleaning service for the whole apartment before we moved out. we got almost all of our security deposit back!!!!!!!! this is just fantastic
my friend recommended this service because it has next day booking. i like how theres a cleaning checklist for me to know what the cleaner will clean. this is transparent and allows me to check that the job is well done. i thought the black splash needed some touch up and they sent another cleaner the next day free of charge to complete the cleaning. the satisfaction guarantee impresses me and i will use this again.

i started coming to one kicks gym in march of 2011, and have had no regrets! i started training in muay thai since 2007, and have been to many different gyms, but none of them were like one kicks gym. at one kicks classes are set up by experience and students are matched up or paired with other students that are in the same level so that learning is easy and fun! you will learn basic, intermediate and at times advanced techniques. master nick, master lookchang, mark dickman and jon fitch are great instructors who are approachable and patient in teaching students form, technique and strategy! once you start going to okg, youll feel like you have another family! i love this place and highly recommend it to all who are interested in getting in shape and working on self confidence!
the crew at one kicks gym really is like a second family to me. master nick and master lookchang have really pushed me beyond my limits as a fighter, and theyve helped me develop a style that is unique to me. the list of champions is growing, so come be one of them!
great gym for both muay thai and jiu jitsu.  they offer classes for kids starting at age 4 all the way to adults.  master nick and master lookchang put a lot of effort into making sure all of their students learn respect and the proper techniques.  family atmosphere where all the students and teachers work together.my kids have been going to one kicks for over 3 years and there isnt a better gym in town.
if you are looking for the best muay thai school in las vegas, search no more... one kicks gym specializes in all skill levels from first timers all the way to ufc and bellator pro fighters.  master nick and master lookchang are super knowledgable, both with 20 years teaching kids and adults.  the gym is clean and located in a great, central location for everyone in the valley.  no more excuses, take a free class today!
i had been wanting to learn to fight for years and finally got around to looking at various gyms throughout southern las vegas.  i checked out a few different places, but then a buddy of mine who had been training at one kicks for a couple of years talked me into coming there for a class and i signed up immediately afterwards.  for the past year and a half i have been training in muay thai and have learned so much from master nick and master lookchang.  they really take the time to work with you on your technique and make sure youre learning correctly.  when i first started i was a clumsy mess.  id fall down a lot. i couldnt make it through class without getting completely exhausted, but with all the training ive received and conditioning ive been honing up my skills pretty well and gradually advancing in rank.  im quite confident now that i could defend myself against an aggressor if needed.  even if fighting is not what youre looking for, its also a great way to stay in shape.  since i started training last year ive dropped my body fat by 8 percentage points and lost 10 pounds.i really like the environment here too.  everyone is an equal.  it doesnt matter if youre a professional mma fighter, an amateur fighter, or someone who has no intention of competing at all.  everyone is friendly and welcoming towards each other.  ive even had some of the pro fighters take their own time to help me out, without me even having to ask, when ive been there practicing by myself during an open mat session.  ive heard stories of other gyms having cliques and people falling into their own little elite group of friends, but you wont see that at okg.  it really is one big family here and im very happy i made the choice to join and meet so many great people who have taught me so many skills ill be able to use for the rest of my life.

opening day was busy, but i went through the drive through and had quick and accurate service. food was hot and fresh, biscuits were flakey and the chicken tenders were on point and juicy. and chicken lovers know that chicken tenders tend to be a bit dry, but the ones i got were nice and juiccaayyy! will be back! its in the winco plaza right across from costco. 1 chicken place in gilbert...until bojangles comes along!!!
great chicken hot and juicy! tenders not as juicy as chicken but thats normal. shrimp is yummy. great varieties of sauces. if you like chicken this is the place. excellent location. ill be back.
oh my god i went again. this is not good for my arteries. i got the spicy 2 piece dinner, with a side of mashed potatoes and cajun gravy, and it includes a biscuit. then i added an additional biscuit, becausei could die tomorrow, and what if i never ate an additional biscuit? lets be real people, biscuits atpopeyes are...flakey, crumbly melt in your mouth soft...a little salty on the crust from generous amounts of butter coating... the chicken was very crispy and did not have a huge layer of fat and skin right underneath like kfc does. lots of flakiness and crumbs from the breading and its delicious!! but i will still to my chicken tenders because its just my preference. i would however always recommend to get an extra biscuit per chicken piece. its that good.
great having one close by. its brand new so there will be some hiccups but nothing detrimental. ill probably eat there more than i should.
popeyes beats the pants off kfc.  we prefer their spicy chicken and have never been disappointed.  we usually have to go to the priesteliott location.  popeyes is like whataburger in that once youve had either or both popeyes and whataburger, youll throw rocks at kfc and the likes of mcdonalds.  hey, popeyes, why not open a location in south chandler east of the freeway???
jai vraiment aime leur sushi, tres bonne qualiteprix. jai deja essaye les autres sushis bars a lasalle et souvent ils ne sont pas frais.                                       lendroit est tres propre et le staff tres sociable.         je recommande!
sushi was fresh, quantity was as expected and each piece was flavourful. delivery was on time and price:quality ratio is on par with the best ive had.  recommend for lunch or dinner with friends and family.
great prices and fresh food! a must stop for your next sushi order! a great little spot!
the aurit center for divorce mediation is a pleasure to work with during some very difficult times in life.  michael is a skilled mediator and attorney  he cares about getting people through the divorce process in the simplest and easiest way possible. very knowledgable and makes you feel at ease. mediation as a whole is the way to go. far less expensive, no fighting, and you never go to court. highly recommend.
the aurit center helps make a very difficult situation, bearable. in every way, they try to make the divorce mediation process comfortable for those involved. i dont understand why anyone would go to court when they can just use mediation. especially, loved the snacks in the office. michael is an excellent mediator. and karen is always a pleasure to deal with as well. unfortunately, lack of proper communication diminishes relationships through time and i occasionally have real estate clients who call and ask for a divorce attorney. i immediately send to the aurit center before things get out of hand and the return response thanking me for doing so is tremendous!!  highly recommend!!
i highly recommend michael at the aurit center for divorce mediation to be your professional mediator.  he is incredibly helpful, knowledgable, responsive, and understands how to navigate the out of court divorce process. divorce can be an extremely long and distressing fight, but the aurit center makes it an efficient, simplified experience. the resources they share with you about helping children through divorce are excellent and show how much they care about your familys well being.
my mom recently fell and cracked her pelvis. ethan was extremely helpful in getting her the services she needs to get her back on her feet. thank you so much for all the help you provided.
nick is awesome! he cleans the windows for my business, inside  out, at a very affordable price. i love how he just comes in periodically and asks if i would like our windows cleaned. he does a very clean and neat job, and never interrupts the ambiance of the business. i would recommend him to anyone.
rarely would i rate a buffet place 55this place is amazing, both in terms of food and also in terms of the environment. when we came in we were greeted by a friendly waitress who offered to take us around and introduced us to the place and their offerings. the place is huge, bright, and nicely renovated, a huge contrast from kinkaku that i recently went. they have a large soup, salad, and dessert bar.you get to order from a ipad which is great because you get to see how big the portion is and whats inside the dish. they food came within 5 mins which im pleasantly surprised. good orders for lunch: udon, short ribs, unagi sushi, sakura sushi lots of salmon, crab meat wrapped with bacon, pudding cups, and shaved ice. the service was awesome as well. the place is heavily staffed, and the waiters regularly collected our empty dishes and filled up our water. i have already recommended tons of people to come try out this place because im blown away by the amazing service.ps. they have a group lounge that can fit 60 people with a karaoke bar
food is great here. youd never expect that ordering pho at a sushi place was a great idea, but here its great. service is a bit slow, but its mainly because they have a reliance on their ipad menu, which is neat. salad bar is nice, the desserts are sub par however. didnt get a chance to try the shaved ice maker, but that looks really neat.not much else to add, this restaurant hits it pretty well on the mark, just the slow service got me slightly.but 55 because of the washroom, you gotta see it yourself.apparently theres a sit down bar inside, im not sure what function that might have if the community doesnt exactly flock to this place, but is neat. i think that have plenty of attractions for people celebrating parties, because i think i saw a karaoke room.
my new go to sushi place! sushi was great, huge variety of other dishes,  convenient salad bar for the hangry girlfriend.  sushi came incredibly quickly and the service was polite and attentive.  very clean establishment
this is the place for sushi in waterloo.  easily compares to great sushi places in toronto.  service was very friendly,  place was very clean,  sushi and sashimi were delicious and very fresh.  in their washrooms they offer mouthwash,  body spray and other random items which was very generous.  atmosphere is modern but relaxing. on top of their extensive menu they offer bingsu shaved ice with condensed milk,  rice cakesjellies and ice cream which i havent seen anywhere else in an all you can eat or buffet style restaurant. honestly after going here i dont think i will go for sushi anywhere else.  the price is also very reasonable for the amount of choice included. go; you wont be disappointed
ive been to other 168 sushi places mainly in ottawa, but they must have redesigned their business model. the service was really attentive, quick and the food was well presented. i enjoyed the soupsalad bar, nice added touch. one thing they do well is work with people with allergies. i am allergic to shellfish, in particular shrimp. not only did they ensure none of the tables food came in contact with shrimp, but they also made special order rolls so i could actually enjoy some of the rolls ive never been able to have... they just make it without shrimp. i was really appreciative of that, plus the 5 off when paying with cash makes it that much better!
one of the newer places that opened in waterloo. its close to campus, has good sushi, but also offers a variety of asian food from steam buns to pho. the decor is classy, and the restaurant combines a mix of traditional selfserve buffet with ipad ordering menus. they also offer a decent selection on their drinks menu if you have a bit more money to spend, but i think the best part about this restaurant is that they have excellent service. my friends and i have been treated well every time we went. our servers name was tony and he was probably one of the most diligent servers weve ever seen. props to this place :
the selection and food here is actually pretty good. they have dim sum which is a 1 for me. also, as others mentioned, you have to check out the washroom.  however, what really blew me away was their service. my friend is a vegetarian, and the manager was really accommodating. when we put in our orders with the ipad, she ensured that all the vegetarian dishes and rolls would be cookedprepared separately from the fish, and without any fish oil or eggs.
unfortunately they were out of brisket, but since its their first day and we came off hours i read this as a good sign high demand. my wife and i both had the pulled pork and ribs with their coleslaw and cheesy potatoes on the side. for dessert we split a slice of cheesecake. the entire meal was delicious and i was pleasantly surprised to find it easily comparable to some of the better bbq places i have eaten at while traveling to kansas city. we will most certainly be regulars here and may even come back this evening to try the next batch of brisket.
had the pulled pork sandwich...was awesome. the coleslaw was great.   a friend was eating the cheesecake...stole a bite...that was very creamy was very happy...food was all great.
ate at got que the first day they opened and we had a great experience.  i literally got the last brisket sandwich of the day and i have to tell you i thought it was excellent!  my kids shared a pulled pork sandwich and they just loved it!  the cheesy potatoes were awesome, however, probably could have used just a touch longer in the oven.  i dont care much for bbq sauce yet i thoroughly enjoyed the sauce that came with my sandwich.  i did get it put on the side but used every last drop!  i cant wait to go back to try the cheesecake and baked beans.  for their first day i would say that they did an amazing job and have done a great job with their customer service!  i will definitely eat here again....and again.....and again!
hubby and i decided to give the new place a try! we love bbq and were excited a place was opening just a block away! the restaurant is very basic on the inside, as it just opened a couple weeks ago. let me just say, what it lacks in flair on the walls, the food makes up for it! its all home made, no frozen or prepackaged stuff and the brisket and ribs are to die for! i was a little disappointed they ran out of cheesecake bc i heard it was delicious! cant wait to come back again!
great new bbq place next to frys marketplace. i had the brisket and potatoes and it was delicious. their sauce sealed the deal for me. check them out and help support our local businesses.
just ordered the family size pulled pork meal... absolutely amazing!!!!! i couldnt stop eating it... it was fresh and hot and omg the cheesy potatoes are soooo yummywe will definitely be backthanks guys your doing a great job
its so good!! we had pulled pork, ribs and brisket for our meats. the cheesy potatoes were to die for! they are new, they run out of food so get there early! i am all for small business shop local, and supporting the community. the one complaint i heard was they use store bought buns, big deal! we go there for the meat, not the buns!! the manager, ricky even went around table to table asking everyone how their dinner was. from what we overheard, every single customer was raving and are mostly repeat customers!  glad we have a new place to eat at!! try the cheesecake too! you wont be disappointed!!
this place is fantastic! i went in on the opening day and had the brisket. it was so good! ive also had the pulled pork and cheesy potatoes. all amazing. theyve even become business members for the pta council in the area, so they catered one of our council meetings. the owner is very kind, the kitchen manager likes to get to know everyone, the rest of the staff is very friendly. its overall a wonderful experience. today, i took my daughters and they shared a half rack of ribs and some cheesy potatoes. they loved it. im always recommending them to everyone. i cant wait to bring my sister when she comes into town!
great place! brisket sandwich is my favorite! service is great, everyone is very friendly too. i will recommend and will be back for sure.
very good food must try! the their bbq brisket is amazing  and my husband loves both the cheesy potatoes  are to die for .you better there soon their food is so good  they run out!!
the food is amazing. its a very basic restaurant, no frills, just good food. we have been there multiple times a d always got good que.
probably the best barbecue ive had in az. the meat was so tender it melted in my mouth. the cheesy potatoes were delicious and dont even get me started on the cheesecake. the man behind the counter was very friendly. great food, definitely a new favorite place to eat in surprise.
excellent moist brisket and pulled pork, friendly staff. would go weekly if i lived in the area. put this on your list for great smoked bbq made on site.
stopped by today for lunch.  moist brisket,cheesy potatoes and coleslaw delicious!.  id read previous comments on the brisket and potatoes which were excellent but i have to say this is probably some of the most favorable coleslaws ive had in the last 10 years. excellent service and yummy food!!
fantastic. we had the pulled pork with extra carolina sauce. moist just the right amount on tang. coleslaw very fresh.  i would prefer a coleslaw with some vinegar tang.
excellent barbeque! tried both the pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches. the smoke flavor didnt overwhelm the meat, which is a failing of many home smokers, and neither did the barbeque sauce which was flavorful. both sandwiches were moist and delicious. although i did not try the side items i look forward to sampling them on my next visit.if you need bbq pork ribs to go, both half and full racks are available.
i just moved here and my mil picked up some food to go and i was amazingly shocked at how good this food is. the ribs dont get much better than this. the potatoes...yum.  dont even get me started on the home made cheesecake.  all awesome!
super friendly staff... i go here every sunday and i get greeted as soon as i walk in and as my food is being prepped, the staff makes small talk with me... the food is very tasteful and you can tell the guy knows what he is doing... i have no idea why some have said the ribs are dry... ive eaten many racks from here and have yet to have a dry one. the brisket is made perfect and yes you get it served on a hamburger bun because thats how its supposed to be served. its bbq, the star is the meat, not the bread. i will continue my sunday tradition especially during football season.
i went in on a sunday.  the pulled pork was tender and very tasty. the cheesy potatoes were great too. not a fancy place but very clean and comfortable .owner was friendly and was concerned about providing good service,he did.going back to try some of the other items.glad to have them in the neighborhood.enjoy!
the barbecue is excellent!!! loved the cheesy taters!!!quick and great service!!! i highly recommend this place for some good ol barbecue!!!! : :
amazing bbque meat is tender and the cheese cake is to die for. the people are nice and friendly too
omg i keep going back havent found not one thing that was bad. the best bbq place in az! the ribs are to die for! the cheesecake is really good. you have to try it. and the cheesy potatoes are like something ive never tried before coming here they are amazing! cant come into this place and not buy all 3. the ribs are soft and smokey.
this place is the best bbq spot on the west valley.  the ribs are a smoky heaven of flavor. the cheesecake is to die for.  i cant wait to go back and try the pulled pork.
so delcious with great service! so tired of no sense of urgency and horrible attitudes. everyone in this building had a smile and said hello to me. the meat fell off the bone, the cheesy potatoes are trouble because i wont stop eating them! i hope they stay forever! thank you for opening!  mike
they just opened yesterday. so far so good!! the bartender was super friendly and the beer was cold so were the machines but hey...they just opened. :d  this bar used to be the old cavalier. since they remodeled it, its super clean with a contemporary flair. lots of super cool old las vegas pictures on the walls. the kitchen wasnt open yet but we will definitely be back to try it out!! the train that goes around the ceiling of the bar is pretty cool. welcome to the neighborhood!!!
super impressive ... started with the frings appetizer awesome...onion rings perfectly cooked, fries perfectly cooked.  then i moved on to the braised short ribs. o m g!!!!! mouth watering! happy belly here.  and lets talk about kimberly the server. amazing! i will be back definitely.:
first time at the old vegas tavern. its a great place. great food i had an amazing club sandwich and the coldest beer in town. excellent service by the bartender rob. he rocks and makes you feel vip! i am definitely coming back
i have been seeing nina here and have followed her from another location.  she is the absolute best! she is very meticulous super sweet and friendly! every time i come here everyone is so welcoming, as if your part of the family. i am always greeted with a smile. nina never rushes and they never rush the girls to get to the next person, which i appreciate and im sure others feel the same way.  i have sent others here and have had the same experience with nina.  she is a sweetheart.  i highly recommend coming in.
i echo what leslie said in her review. im so excited that i found this place! been coming here for a few months for pedicures. so far i have only seen nina who does such a great job that i always ask for her. i have ingrown toenails which need some tlc, and they get it. she is thorough, patient and very sweet. i never feel rushed and am always happy i came.
the best hot dogs ive had in my entire life!!!! since leaving lv its hard for me to even eat any hot dogs now. the ingredients are unique and very gourmet, not your ordinary hot dog stand. tied with fuku burger as my favorite food truck in vegas! ash hoff ownerhead chef offers many delectable culinary creations. ive had just about everything on the menu and its all so scrumptious never been disappointed once. hot dog wise, the general lee is by far my favorite. the rebel dog is a chilli dog with a twist crispy haystack like onions. my new current favorite is the nacho dog. aside from hot dogs they offer the innovative lobster corn dog a fresh lobster tail battered and fried, drizzled with chili aioli a lime and micro greens, its worth the price!!! street tacos, their own line of sauces great for your own personal cooking and fries. ash is always experimenting and trying new recipes so theres usually always a special menu item. cant wait til they get their own fixed restaurant. he deserves it and vegas or somewhere in the states needs it. if you ever catch them out somewhere even if youre not hungry stop by and just say hi. aside from eating there its always fun just chilling at the truck with the crew.
great food, great service and great vibe from the truck crew, these are not your ordinary hotdogs. i order the lobster dog and it was excellent. the best dogs in town, im defiantly coming back to try the other hotdogs in the menu!
my boyfriend and i had a hot dog craving and found this cool hot dog truck on yelp! we got the nacho dog and the general lee dogi think thats what it was called, and the lobster corndog. all of them were fantastic! i loved the lobster corn dog because it was something i had never tried and i am glad i did! my boyfriend was a huge fan of everything as well. the owner was a way cool dude and had an awesome personality too! we will be returning in the near future! thanks again! :
everyone loved their food!  had the lobster corndog, 51, nacho dog, the rebel, 9th island!  we loved them all!
wow. this place is so good i would never come to hustler without going to this wiener coach because any wieners station never be as good as if i would rather go here in a fivestar restaurant i live in vegas i am a local but if i ever want to wiener i will always go to the wiener dude wheres my hotdog hotdog ill go to the hot wiener dog bye
after we had an amazing time at larry flynts hustler club we walked out and had a nacho hotdog and lobster corndog. so delicious! we love the food and do this everytime we come here.
ive been to this truck a few times. who doesnt love a good hotdog? my favorite was the general lee. until this weekend at the great american foodie fest. i tried their new bangkok dog, loaded with fresh carrots, peppers, cucumbers, and a thai peanut sauce. my only complaint was that i gave half to my wife and didnt get to eat the whole thing! hope this one makes the regular menu board, yum!
best hotdog ever me and wifey had the chilli hotdog and tge hongkong dog both were tge best ever clean and nice place a lil expensive but who cares food was good
these girls know their way around hair!  i trust melissa to do anything with my hair, and she never fails to do great work.  if youre looking for a stylist this is the place you want to go.  great work and great prices!
i love matriarch salon. mel is so professional and a mastermind at her craft! i always leave there feeling fresh and new. i also get my brows done there she uses european wax and my brows have never looked better!
melissa at matriarch is amazing! ive been photographing her hair work for years now. bridal, fashion, whatever. always amazing and always getting better and better... if thats possible. i recently worked with her on a bridal shoot and i was blown away with her creation. also, she is one of the nicest people ever. always passionate about what she does and making people look amazing.
so happy they reopened! was there on opening night and the food was still outstanding! love the flautas!
our family stopped by the new location this last sunday evening and had the best time chatting with the staff and the owner, dave even stopped by to give us a personal hello. the dinner was deliciousi am a bit of a snacker so i had the taco topped with sliced avocado and my husband had a huge portion of fajitas and the cookie ice cream dessert was devoured by our 6 year old in about 2 seconds flat...over all fantastic food and service. thank you for your hospitality!! we are looking forward to our next visit.
so glad they finally reopened up this location.  we were here on opening night and have been back probably 45 times.  so good!  we are big fans of the food here and i have decided its time to break away from my normal two rolled taco meals and try new things.  i have!service is always great and their chips and salsa is delish!
wow! yum!!! so glad that scottsdale carlos is back!! have already been five times since it opened. love the new building and location!! the bar is very cool and i hear live music is starting soon. cant wait!! great to go eat and then see a movie or go shopping.
we had a meal there on sundaysat in the barwe had dj for a waiterhe was attentive and awesomewe had the most delicious food..i had the tamale with red sauce and rice  beans...its highly addictive ..the chips and salsa are fantastic.....wonderful experience....the food they serve has sooo much extra flavor it will blow your mind....
wow!  i took my mother who is visiting from out of town for lunch and we had an awesome meal chicken taco salad.  my daughter had the mini tacos and she loved them along with the rice and beans. the service and food was excellent!  the resturant space is very cool and trendy.  i plan to go back this weekend to have a few drinks at the bar, looked like a fun place to hang out at night.  i will be back for sure!
always loved carlos obriens when they were at scottsdale road and bell road.i pretty much get the 9 combination with a green burro and substitute the tostada with another taco to give me 2 tacos.i love their open face cheese crisp and the pollo fundido which are 2 chicken chimichangas with sour cream and cheese on top.their complementary chips and salsa are great but dont eat too much before your meal arrives so you.this is my go to mexican restaurant when my family cant decide where to go even though my kids dont care for mexican food a great deal.i could probably eat here everyday if i could.live this place and glad they opened back up in my neighborhood area.will be back very soon or when we are near by.
i was reading some of these reviews of cob and i have no idea what these loonies are saying? i went here last night and had a fantastic experience. i got the always amazing 13, bit of everything plate with a beef tamale, no cheese. it was perfect. this food is like family style food made with love. if you are looking for some hole in the wall, found in the bario, this may not be for you as it is food you bite into and your eyes close and you say,mmmh. the new place is pretty cool, it had a blade runnerski lodge feel to it. i also had a hornitos margarita, which was the perfect capper on this lovely evening. cant wait to come back and try the desert. i dont want to forget the service, everyone kept our drinks full, extra napkins, and made sure we were enjoying our meal. keep up the great work cob. ill be back.
dr. monica brown makes house calls, which is a godsend for owners of old pets that get unbearably anxious going to a vets office. dr. brown has excellent rapport with animals and their owners. she is thorough, patient, and unhurried. we are grateful to her for her help keeping our spoiled old dogs in as good health as possible. she is wonderful.
saying goodbye to your pet is never easy... our sweet kitty had advanced stage kidney disease. after all the joy he brought to our lives, it was the least we could do to make sure he didnt have to suffer in the end. we wished to have inhome euthanasia to minimize the stress on our beloved riley. dr. monica brown was just wonderful. she was very professional, compassionate, and helpful. she had a busy schedule on the day we needed her but was still able to make time for us. we were so grateful!
dr. monica brown had been treating my moms two huge labs for various ear problems because they refused to go out the front door shes a mobile vet. when it came time to put one down, she came out with an assistant because the lab was so huge and it was a very dignified, very compassionate sendoff. she wasnt in a hurry and made us feel that we were the most important thing on her schedule that day. fast forward a few months later and it was time we had to put down our dog cancer and so dr. brown came out the same day we called and we went through that painful process once again. this is the perfect solution when your animal is sick or dying and moving them in a car is not something you want to subject them to. she explains everything thoroughly, is very gentle, and afterward she makes a nice paw imprint as a keepsake. shes a very good vet and she will make you glad you called her.
its too bad the other reviewer had such a bad experience.i went in there because my dealer had told me i needed brakes right away, before they damage the rotors.  i had forgotten about it for a couple months, then thought gee, i better get it done.  i brought it in, and it turned out i didnt need brakes, i still had about 30k miles left on mine, i just needed brake fluid.  so nice to find an honest place for once.
thanks to the guys at fletchers for squeezing our car into a busy weekend.normally i do my own work but i am starting a business, and just dont have time anymore.they proved they are not just minions by matching the labor estimate of another further shop, and still squeezing us into their busy weekend schedule.  it was a groupon weekend for them.thanks again, now i just have to adjust to a clutch that doesnt slip.
delicious soul food. hospitality extradonaire.  a must for all you military and civilian folk.
although location could be a bit shaky. the food and service is great! pork chops is perfect! keep up the good work!
the food is great and the cook is sweet as can be. you cant get any closer to a home cooked meal then this place.  the restaurant is clean and the decor of southern feeling. i have went there twice on two random times lunch and dinnerand both times the food was on point. the customer service was outstanding. my husband and could have went anywhere for dinner last night for our anniversary and we choose this place.  you will not be disappointed you will get the best southern home cooking, clean environment, 5 star customer sevice with good prices you cant bet. ask for the fried catfish, and the is  gumbo ridiculous!!!!! oh and the sweet tea is the real sweet tea.

great new location. they have tons of current issues, best collection of back issues, and lots of toys and collectibles. this is the best spot in the valley for comic books.
the best comic shop in phoenix.  theres a spending requirement for credit card use.  bring cash if youre only hoping to pick up 1 issue.
im sad were moving out of the city, because this is by far my favorite comic shop since atomic comics closed.my wife and i inherited a diverse collection of comics from her late father, and this was the only comic shop that would take the time to go through the collection with us and help us figure out which ones were worth getting appraised by the cgc.clean, bright and friendly staff. you folks are the best.
great ambience great staffgreat beer selectionawesome food selection. today was the grand opening and they didnt disappoint. staff was very knowledgeable on their beer selection. the hostesses very polite, welcoming and accommodating. staff was very knowledgable about cocktails, the beer list and food menu. even the food runners were very welcoming and friendly :
solid food. great beer list. this should be a great place to watch sports. cant wait to see what it turns into.
not your average las vegas strip food stop! seriously the best food for the best prices on the las vega strip! great cocktail menu and phenomenal food! the chef and manager both stopped by our table to make sure everything was great, which was a nice touch to the service. great spot for people watching and enjoying the strip.  the spicy cheetoh cheese is just something you have to experience...
this is my new spot for lunch. right on the las vegas strip. big space, fast service, a diverse menu of quality eats at a affordable price. i started with  the cheesy puffs, two orders of lollipop  wings, salt and pepper and buffalo.  buffalo wings were my favorite of all the appetizers. the cheesy puffs were like a mozzarella cheesy puff fried then rolled in hot cheeto crumbs.  the beer menu is legit too. they have a huge selection. i tried the innis and gunn rare oak. def one of the best beers i have had. the hazelnut beer i tried was really good too kinda like a nutella beer.
omg love the atmosphere during dinner you have a beautiful view of aria and cosmo and of course people watching!! we got carne assda fries and devoured it and then had an awesome burger the triple bbb with pulled pork, my friend celeste had nice piece of salmon, great experience!! thank you to the staff and kitchen for a great time and great food
had an amazing lunch at this new location on the strip!! ordered the rib eye. it was cooked to a perfect medrare. beer selection was on point! patio view of the strip was awesome, the service was the best ive had in a while. from the hostess to the bussers. they were all accommodating and knowledgeable of the menu.  ill def be back and will recommend to my friends and fam!! peoples republic is where its at!!
definitely will be back for the beer selection and food. service was great. a bunch of tvs to watch sports. they changed the tv so i could get the cubs game on. awesome
this place has really good potential. great location on the las vegas strip, really good food and 32 beers on tap! the staff is super friendly and quite knowledgable about there food menu and their beer selection. sat at the bar and the bar staff was really attentive and awesome definitely coming back here again.
this place is awesome! shoutout to tate! great, enthusiastic and friendly, dude! new favorite place on the strip!
decided to check out peoples republic because i saw it on yelps hot and new list. i loved it! fantastic service and delicious food! the server, brandon, was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and quick. he gave us great recommendations and never left us wanting. the food was delicious. started with the pepperoni flat bread which was perfectly cooked with a nice crust. perfect appetizer or light meal. the cod tacos were fresh and cooked just right. you can just tell that the fish they used for the tacos was top notch. it was tender, flavorful and not overcooked like most restaurants do. i also had a taste of my husbands classic burger with cheese. yum! im not a burger fan at all but i was tempted to devour his burger. i usually dont order burgers because the meat is either tough or flavorless. this was not the case at peoples republic. good quality meat and great flavor!  i cant wait to go back and try out the other items they have on their menu. i have my eye on their ribeye but figured a ribeye would be a bit much for lunch. no worries, ill be back real soon! good food, good service? how can i resist?!
shane i know i wouldnt spell her full name correctly was awesome! she was so personable and professional. she was willing to hangout and chat with us but still worked with others just as much. we approve of the place and had a great time. its only been open for a few months so it was a little slower, but it was a better experience than most of the other bars we stopped in.
amazing server tisa was just an amazing person, great service, the food was amazing i love it.
in from new york. a gazillion places on the strip, but this place is absolutely fantastic. the drinks are tasty, beer selection vast and the food is amazing. please try the carne asada fries and the steak with garlic mash and string beans!
i think i have a new favorite brewery in town. the beer was excellent, many styles that are not overrepresented in charlotte, delicious cream ales, locally roasted pure intentions coffee browns, a wild strawberry sour, etc etc. the beer was great and a refreshing change of pace, hopefully this is the start of many interesting innovative beers. i also liked the lower priced half pint pours so i could taste more without overdoing it, also nice they had quality nonalcoholic sodacoffee options. the facility was great, drinking amongst the brewing equipment, a great industrial feel, its tight, which i like at breweries because then people pierce the personal space bubble and talk to eachother. they also were very smart and put small bar space and stools on what would normally be unused railings, comfortable, lots of seating, but be happy to share a long table with strangers. an ok amount of outdoor seating, and the obligatory food truck parked right outside. music was folksy and mellow and at a great talkable volume, i think i will be returning often.
free range was our 7th brewery visit in two days and it was a sure favorite. they dont do flights but they do 12 pints for a great price. at first we were hesitant but the caroliner wild ale was on point and went down as fast as any tasting glass i had all week. great new, fresh, and trendy vibe. the bar tenders were tentative and on point. great service!
tasty brews with creative names. great atmosphere. whats not to like?!same brewery, different daynever thought a pickle beer would be so highly satisfying, but i am highly satisfied. p.s. they got me drunk
every beer i had was really well done session ipa, coffee stout, farmhouse with cucumber, great open and light vibe inside, great staff and one of the owners, jeff, was cool to talk to. favorite brewery in charlotte so far.
awesome spot. great beer, atmosphere, and cool staff.  i had an american ipa, the hop to my heart my darling, and it was really good! not too hoppy and even has a hint of citrus.they have art, music, and games. looking forward to coming here again on my next visit to charlotte!
the best new brewery in charlotte! lovely atmosphere and delicious beer.friendly servers, dogfriendly, spacious tap room and corn hole. i love this place and worry the word will get out and ruin it, but oh well, its the best!
i have been going to alicia for the past year now and she is absolutely amazing massage therapist. she has a very good feel for the body, i dont have to say a word as she very quickly figures out all the spots that needs attention. she clearly has had a lot of experience and cares about the wellbeing of her clients. i highly recommend alicia.
alicia is a healer. she takes massage to the next level and soothes whatever is aching and but then goes a step beyond and diagnoses the core issue and fixes it. treat yourself to a healing session with alicia, you will be glad you did.
i feel absolutely amazing! i just experienced the most theraputic, deep tissue massag with alicia! alicia was very thorough and asked detailed questions as to where i have pain and injury. having a massage therapist focus on every part of where pain stems from and relieve you from  pain priceless!!! i am asking my wife to schedule a once a month visit with alicia if it means feeling this amazing after a one hour massage and hot stone therapy from alicia! looking forward to seeing you again  and thank you for relieving my back and ankle pain!
i was in vegas for my sweepers for my bowling league.  my back and shoulder was bothering me so i called alicia last minute and she hooked it up.  she had me like a new man when she was done.  she was very professional and thoughtful.  not only did she amaze me with her magic hands, but she was funny as well.  i have no complaints and will definitely be a repeat customer.  gracias alicia!!!
alicia is the absolute best!!! shes a true professional and she pays attention to the problematic areas of your body without neglecting the rest. every time i see her its different as she caters to what i need most that visit. my body feels renewed after her magic healing touch! her massage has become a must at least once every month. i love that i found my favorite massage therapist!
she is the best!  she delivers so much more than a massage. she knows how to relieve pain and help heal.
so not only was alicia very easy to work with our schedule and work me and my husband in for his birthday...the massage was one of the best of my life!! i highly recommend her and will call her again when we return to vegas!!
i met alicia over a year ago.  after having 7 back surgeries, i was a mess.  she greeted be with a smile and said lets get started.  she knew exactly where my pain was and i left a new person.  her techniques and vast knowledge makes her one of a kind!  shes very perceptive and knows where i need more attention. shes my angel and i would recommend her to everyone!
hello serious helpers! alicia is the absolute best  i mean best at what she does! shes very knowledgeable  knows how to work out all the knots outs. you can clearly see that she is very experienced at what she does. ive never met anyone who works as hard as she does. she works out of the la  las vegas area. shes not always in la, but when she is she gives amazing massages. when im back in vegas i will definitely call alicia. if you are in need of a dream massage, a gift for a stress gf  wifey in your home or at her new office location you have come to the right place! merry christmas all.
wow. we stumbled upon this place while halloween shopping next door. we had three hungry kids with us and no idea what to order. the staff was amazing. they helped each one of us and made suggestions after hearing what we liked and didnt like. travis if not a manager, should be... or even general manager was amazing! he checked on us and the kids twice. i cant say enough positive things about travis and the rest of the staff! the restaurant was very clean, welcoming, and the pasta was the best! we will definitely be returning at least twice a month from now on and its a 30 minute drive for us. thank you to travis and the rest of the staff for helping us order, making us comfortable, and truly delicious food.
i wish more places like this would open up on our side of town. im always looking for healthy options when i dont feel like cooking and always come up short and end up cooking or eating unhealthy. i prefer not to eat breadpasta and they have an in the buff alternative with spinach instead of pasta. the entire experience was a pleasant one with the staff being super friendly and helpful. the manager even met us at the door to go over the menu with us. we will be back!!
we frequent thesis bar a lot and its amazing to have a second dog dog bar in the charlotte area. i got a magarita for 5, they also ofer beer and wine, theyre still super new and so kind of quiet. no special programs like trivia or anything thing but they do have all kinds of arcade games like skee ball, basketball, pool etc. to keep the hoomans occupied while the pups play. still quiet but i suspect will pick up soon. overall great vibe!!
love this place! i dont have a dog, but we like to play music here, and weve had a blast performing in such a comfy, casual environment. the bar staff has always been super friendly and the dogs seem to have a fabulous time. there is a covered bar for shade, but most tables are uncovered  although the shade trees are really pretty and do provide some respite from the sun. we brought our toddler once, and he had a blast playing with another little boy and the pups. weve played there four times now, and each time it seems like the crowd is getting just a little larger, so word of mouth seems to be catching on!
i live in the neighborhood  have been here a few times. its great to have a place that i can walk to and let me dog run around  play with other dogs. there is no food but you can order from 3 local restaurants  they will deliver. i will definitely keep coming here, mainly so my doggie can get some socializing time!
what an awesome place.  i was greeted by wagging tails as i walked in which automatically put a smile on my face. the bartender was fabulous and great with beer recommendations.  tried some new ones he recommended and loved them.  nodas cavu is a new favorite. lots of variety!  will definitely visit again. if you are not a dog lover obviously you should avoid it, but its a perfect spot for those of us who do love dogs.
my husband and i moved in on august 1st sight unseen after reserving an apt in april. it was a little risky, but everything that was promised was delivered. our apartment is beautiful and well appointed. best of all, there is no neighbor noise. the construction must be very good because we never hear our next door neighbors.i am a bit of a squeaky wheel but every time i ask the staff for something, they listen and take care of it right away. we could not be happier with our decision to live here. dont hesitate to make volare your home, unless you are an inconsiderate neighbor.....then please, go somewhere else. lol
this place is awesome. i researched for awhile before choosing any new apartment and glad i choose this location. from the very moment i took my tour and saw my future apartment i was really happy with the decision. the amenities offered, location, and apartment details was everything i wanted plus more. there have been a few minor issues, but its expected with a new complex. and they have been resolved by the office staff in a timely manner. and everyone i have encountered at the office has been really nice and pleasant to work with. yes, there still is construction going on and before moving in, i was warned about this. but because of everything i have encountered so far, i am okay with this. even if it starts early in the morning. for its only temporary and i knew that coming into a newly built complex. trust me, what this place has to offer the noise is the least of your worries. i am glad to say this is my home for now and cant wait to see what else this place can do to amaze me.
sainthenri newest store that opened about a week ago on the outskirt of marche jeantalon. the market was in need of a truly good indie coffee shop but no one expected sainthenri to set up shop here.anyway, the cafe is located in the old defunct la grange location in a nicer decor. its all clean and all marble. very spacious locale. the tables are quite small. truly made for sitting down, drink coffee and out you go. while it is possible to work, it is best done during the week as the market isnt as busy but on weekend, its impossible. besides, one gotta be mindful of others and free up tables for incoming patrons. theres some benches outside but it could use more seating area like turning one of the 2 counters into a table.as for coffee, its great coffee besides the very smack in your face godshot. that one is mainly used at the quartier latin location and its very very hard to drink. so far, ive only saw the godshot being offered as coffee of the day and you would have to ask for it. so rejoice, youll drink something less harsh.price wise, its actually cheaper by about a quarter to 2 quarters than at their quartier latin for example.as for opening hours, theres nothing set in stone yet but when i asked, they said probably opening an hour before market opening time to get the workers and merchants and closing an hour after market closing time.all in all, im very happy that theres finally a true indie coffee shop in marche jeantalon even though its sainthenri and that i have soucoupe cafe nearby that offers sainthenri but its going to give other cafes as well as the godawful starbucks a run for its money even though they cater to different crowd.the coffee game has been raise in the marketps. they offer baked goods from guillaume. take that premiere moisson and pain dore!
un cafe mignon et lumineux. le decor est epure que cela cree une ambiance de detente et de bien etre tout de suite. le cappucino etait tellement bon que jen ai repris un deuxieme. ils offrent des cafes raffines venant des quatres coin du monde. les tables sont mini donc cest un endroit plus pour discuter, peutetre un peu moins pour bosser. jai quand meme eu une rencontre tres agreable sur place a travailler sur mon ordi.
this place is awesome for families, kids, and even adults! very reasonable prices. free refills on drinks!?!? is this real life!?! from bowling, mini golf, and recline movie seats. the staff was all very helpful and super friendly. definitely come give this place a shot, it is well worth it.food is affordable and tasty. we had fries, onion rings, and fried zucchini. it was all very good.the theater is amazing!! and the prices!?! how are they so good. the seats are amazing.
best pizza ever ... and much more!!  salads are great. lots of choices for adults and kids. delicious. reasonable pricing. cher t., general manager is personable and very attentive to guests making sure everything is perfect. service is exceptional by all staff  smiling , polite and efficient. order is ready and served in a flash.  lots of places to go for pizza  but fat cats   pizini  gilbert is the best !  rick  peggy s.
stopped in for dinner and a movie pixels. was pleasantly surprised that the food was pretty good, service was wonderful and i love the lounge chairs for the movie. will definitely be back for more. still need to take in the bowling and mini golf.
had a fun time doing the glow golf with the kids. lots of activities to choose from. got to try bowling and the food next time. lanes are 22 and shoes are 3.50.
this place is awesome! the event staff that we used for a corporate event was very accommodating. things went ultra smoothe. we had a party of about 50 and they took care of every thing. from the movie that we all attended to the bowling and arcade, it all made for a great event. fun for all of the guests, outstanding food, wings brick oven pizza, all at a price that was better them comparable venues. the staff is the best we have ever had at a corporate event. melissa, celeste, shannon and michael. great safe environment for all ages. luxury cinema with food and beverages. dancing in the isles. wow, we will definitely be back.i highly recommend this place for corporate events!
this place is great. lots of activities for the family that will not cost you an arm and a leg to enjoy.  bowling and food are way inexpensive compared to main event and flip side.  the movie theaters are a plus, they have nice recliners with a lot of leg room.  you get to pick your own seats and the prices are cheaper than harkins.  i do like the free refills of soda.  we also had a birthday party for my son.  melisa, our host and event manager, provided us with excellent service.  get the package that provides bowling, pizza, and glow in the dark golf. its worth it.  overall this is my new place to watch a movie, no worries about finding a seat just buy them ahead of time.  this place is still under the radar thats why the theaters are not so packed but eventually it will get there.
just had our daughters 11th bday party here and it was a hit! bowling party with pizza from theyre in house restaurantno ordinary pizza, it was delicious..handmade crust, might he been brick oven baked. endless soda. glow in the dark golf and then each kid received 5 for the arcade! wonderful experience! and its nice and clean!!
we have been here a few times for bowling and have had the pizza at pizini a couple of times. the bowling is great. the price is reasonable and my kids love it. they charge you for the lane by the hour with up to 6 bowlers and the bumpers automatically go up for the kids designated when you pay. i really like the pizza. its cooked in a wood fire oven so the crust is crisp and chewy. plus i think its reasonably priced. ive also had the fried zucchini, wings, and onion rings, all of which were good. the only thing i do not like is how much they charge for the arcade games around 1 per game. it adds up quick when you have little kids who want to try everything. we also tried the goofy golf once but probably wont do that again as our kids are a little too young and really didnt get it. overall we like this place and will keep coming back for the bowling and pizza.
this place is amazing!!! this is the only place i will ever go to see movies ever again. we went there as a family today to check it out and it blew our expectations out of the water!! when we walked in we decided we were going to see a movie so bought our tickets which are very reasonably priced! then instead of the same ol popcorn which you can also get we got pizza! and the pizza was delicious, along with the exotic variety! so while we waited for our movie and food, we drank a beer and played some of the many awesome video games they had! then they deliver your food right to your seats. the seats, omg the seats! the most comfortable seats ever! they sprawled back, reclined with tons of foot space in front! we were on cloud 9!!! we ate our pizza, watched our movie, while completely relaxed! we will definitely be back to bowl, golf, and see more movies!!!
this place is amazing! i dont know how anyone can put a bad review. the movie theatre there is awesome! huge reclining leather chairs, with more leg room that you thought possible. the best part, you can order some food and they bring it right to you in the theatre! who wants to buy 7 dollar popcorn when you can recline with a pizza for the same price!? i left with leftovers! and the ticket for the move was less than going to any big movie theatre chain. i wont go anywhere else for my movie experiences. i also loved the fact that, while we waited for the movie to start, i could grab a beer or cocktail and kick some ass on some arcade games. they have some new and enthralling games set up there. we almost missed the beginning of our movie haha! oh, and the staff there, are friendly and always ready to help. its a comfortable and fun atmosphere. next time im definitely checking out the bowling. nothing better than cosmic bowling, with the option of a movie within walking distance!
we recently had my daughters birthday party here, and i was blown away.  initially, it was a little chaotic, trying to sort out the shoe situation, but once the kids had their correct shoes, they started bowling and had a blast!  every member of the staff from melisa the event manager to michael our server to the mechanics and servers and support staff we met truly provided excellence in customer service.  they all really wanted to make sure we were happy and having fun!  melisa went out of her way to be accommodating with me and making it special for our birthday girl.  i loved that her primary concern was that my daughter had a great time.  she was so pleasant to work with!the pizza was really good!  i mean, when i think of bowling alleys i typically dont think of great pizza.  i remember greasy triangles where the cheese slides off the slice.  but this was high quality we will probably return for the pizza very soon!one tip i would have for you is be aware that if you have small children, the mini golf area might be a little frightening we lost a few golfers that way but the kids seemed to really enjoy it!overall, we were told several times over this place was the best party they had been to in a long while.  our guests loved it, we loved it. we are already looking forward to our next visit!
my kids love it here. the movie seating is super comfortable with lazy boy loungers. the pizza is great ! the mini golf is a little small but it was still fun. we like that there are several things to do. we also have bowled here.
we enjoy family night here on sundays ! but never had food just bowling,movie and mini golf !!
awesome movie theater!! electric reclining reserved seats. affordable pricing on food and snacks with free drink refills starting as low as 2.00. highly recommend watching movies here.
visited fat cats today for the first time to catch a movie at the dinein theater. on tuesdays they have 5 movies and if its your first yelp checkin, you get a free large popcorn with purchase of two movie tickets. in addition, i ordered a large drink so we spent 13 and some change for our experience, which is quite a bargain! i wanted to fill my cup with iced tea but they hadnt brewed it yet but an employee who appeared to be management as a reviewer previously stated, mostly all employees are teenagers offered to bring me fresh brewed tea to my seat once it was ready. sure enough, about 5 minutes into the movie he showed up with my drink. that was great customer service. the popcorn was very, very good! i thought harkins had the best but fat cats proved me wrong. the theater itself is perfect! ive seen movies at other dinein theaters such as the ipic and studio movie grill and fat cats surpassed my expectations! the seats are incredibly comfortable. though we didnt get entrees from pizini, id assume that it might be challenging to eat in your seat since there didnt appear to be a little tray or table to set your food down. either way, i am highly impressed and will be back again soon!
only have been to the movie theatre. but you pick your seats! 5 on tuesdays! large recliner seats with spacing equally between all other seats.
this little starbucks is located inside of the smiths grocery store.its your basic starbucks, they offer the majority of the same item that you will typically find at the stand alone stores. the only difference is their pastries, they dont have as many. the customer service here is super, the people working here are always very nice and happy and go the extra mile to make sure that your drink tastes delicious.here they also offer different little special, today they had a buy 1 chocolate straw get one free. they also give you stars just like the other starbucks, when you use your gold card. or your starbucks card for that matter. when you use your call card. or your starbucks card for that matter. im sure glad they opened one here in smiths! yay!
always refreshing venti carmel frappe anytime of day! its been a long day of running all over vegas so why not end it with my favorite drink on my way home so i can sit down relax and actually enjoy it!
kendra was awesome! she help w the new  custom mixture , which being a creature of habit....can be very  frightening! yummmers all day! my dopeo ristretto w carmel was delishhhhh! taste close to a vietnamese coffee but 10x better! thanks kendra!!!!
after my amazing breakfast i got my beautiful new basket liner for my bike! they have a huge selection here. the new shop is coming along nicely and conveniently located by santan mall! i will be back for more goodies!
thank you for the amazing experience at your store. the gentlemen were so kind as i picked out the perfect bicycle for myself. they were patient and knowledgable, and ensured that i made the right choice for me. no pressure, just good old fashioned customer service! i was so excited, i rode home from the bike shop like a kid who just left the store with a new pair of shoes! if you are in the market to buy a bicycle, do not waste your time on the internet, stop by and support your local business, and they will be your subject matter experts!
thanks, brian for my beautiful cruiser! fantastic customer service and a great selection of bikes. we will be back for sure!
my boyfriend and i just purchased two phat cycles from freeride and we absolutely love them! the store was clean, the service was fabulous, and we are now two loyal customers. if youre looking for a new bike, or simply need a repair, freeride bike co. is a one stop shop! thank you so much, bryan for all your help.
my husband and i each have a trike, from freeride, all tricked out with hub lights, cup holders, mileage guides, bell signals, front and rear lighting and a great basket liner for my bike.  any problems? no problem, they fix what ever they sell.  recently a friend took a bike in that they had not bought from freeride  they fixed it for free too! the shop is fun to visit, employees great to work with.
i have taken two bikes into freeride for service and they are amazing. so speedy and knowledgeable. the owner was telling me about bike laws for safety as i was riding in the dark. great prices, great service. definitely recommend this place.
after a lovely morning walking along the waters of leith, my friend and i left stockbridge market hungry and indecisive about where to eat. on our way up to the new town to find a budget sitdown restaurant we discovered this little place.red and white table cloths, olive oil in the window, pizza in the display cabinet topped with plump tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella; i feel like i have stepped into a roman neighbourdhood.now, an authentic italian restaurant is quite a find. this place is run by italians and offers a good variety of pizza and pasta options with fresh and tasty ingredients, all at pretty honest prices. the biggest novelty lies in the fact that nova offers authentic vegetarian italian food. i had the soya mince lasagna £6.50. my friend opted for one of the specials of the day, the four cheese and mushroom gnocchi £7. his portion was very generous whereas mine was pretty small but super tasty. he commented that his dish was glorious and kept mentioning how good it was all day. we will be back.
wow! i am not a vegetarian in the slightest but popped over for a meal as i work nearby. i actually went 3 days in a row and i now might have a problem. actually booked the restaurant out for my wifes birthday :.the fresh made to order pizzas are incredible. amazing amazing amazing.had a chat with the gent who opened the restaurant and hes been working in edinburgh restaurants a while and decided to pursue his passion of his own restaurant.so if youre looking for an amazing pizza quattro formaggi for me check this place out! authentic italian, with lots of love and passion in the service a food! have to say it. best pizza in edinburgh!
i had wanted to try this place for aaaages! i made a group booking for a vegan meetup and because they only have around 21 seats they asked if i could send them a list of preordered food choices. i made a word table with everyones names and their starters, mains, and desserts. i loved this set up and i think all restaurants should require the same; it really saves time on waiting for people to make up their minds! email correspondence back and forth was great for an accurate note of vegan menu options they can email you a separate menu, the version on the website isnt that clear of what is and isnt vegan and i had the document of food orders with me on my phone and reminded everyone what they had ordered when the food started arriving.  the pizzas came loaded with vegan cheese or they have dairy options, too and were delicious. my personal preference is for bases a bit more soft and doughy and less crispy, but others saw this as a plus point. starter sizes were generous, and if you order a bruschetta you may not manage a pizza main to yourself unless you love love love bread. really love bread. i opted for the potato, cheese, and pesto pizza  delicious!!! then, i had the pizza dolce  two pizza base slices topped with a chocolate and hazelnut spread and icing sugar, which was also very tasty and not too overly sweet. i got the coconut cheesecake to take away which was really creamy  chocolate cheesecake was also offered as an alternative flavour.they have wine and beer available and byob is also an option; its £3 on a bottle of wine and £1.50 on a beer. they also accept cards. booking is highly recommended!

i found steven skwarkowski on las vegas craigslist today headline used the words certified and professional based in henderson, nv and felt good about him after our initial phone visit  invited him to debug and devirus my mothers windows 7 pc in green valley.  he doesnt charge extra for house calls.  steven showed up exactly on time with his tool bag, was young, clean cut, friendly, took his shoes off before walking on my moms carpet, and got right to work troubleshooting and fixing the computer problems.  usually im pretty good at cleaning up a sluggish computer, but the long term mess my 68 yearold mom had created on her machine was way over my head.  steven knows the insandouts of computers like a dentist knows tooth enamel and root canals.  he did a great job performing his computer surgery and was diligent about it.  his appearance, demeanor, and skill exceeded our expectations.  ill not only invite him to service my familys computers from now on, but also ill recommend him to friends and colleagues.  he honored his advertised rates  there were no phony hidden charges.  im glad i took the time to find the right person for my moms computer.  i dont have to shop around again for someone i can trust  stevens the one.
my desktop was slow, internet not functional.  i needed a fix, found steve on yelp. i liked his hours 8a8p  the price was right. arrived on time, dx my issues, did multiple repairs  fixes.i have a custom pc, steve addressed a few minor problems ,left my desktop running as good as new. also took the time to relocate my tower to free up more desk space. plus installed new antivirus software  removed unwanted files  millions.my pc is much improved..thanxx steve!
steven was great!  he showed up in minutes and fixed my pc and kept me posted every step along the way!  i needed to be somewhere so he got me fixed up as quick as possible and even came back two days later to finish up some minor details but he worked around my crazy schedule!  he was very knowledgeable and great in explaining the issues he resolved.  i would recommend him to everyone
steve was able to get everything on my computer recovered and get it back up and running in a matter of 24 hours. the fact that he is mobile made things 10x easier for me. highly recommend him

after being referred to sport auto detail from my mechanic, i brought in my 1991 bmw 318is which i just purchased from across the country. the car was in great shape overall, but had not been properly cleaned and detailed in years. i was especially concerned about protecting the paint from the arizona heat. rudy, the owner of sport auto detail, and his team did an incredible job of detailing the bmw for a very fair price. i was quoted at least 100 more from other shops around the valley. rudy is very knowledgable and does not cut cornershe has been in the detailing business for 17 years. his team works on simple quick details up to 3,000 classic car jobs.this tempe location is relatively new so it does not have much a social media presence. they have more photos and details on their facebook page if you want to see more examples. i recommend giving rudy a call for your next detail!
sport auto detail has detailed my car for the overspray. all of the work they have done has turned out exactly as promised. my car look as new as the day i picked up from the dealer. the technicians are timely, polite, and professional in everything they do. sport auto detail is an excellent highend company to detail any vehicle at a fair price.
only saw 1 review on rudys detail business on yelp. seeing having many years experience i gave it a shot. couldnt be more satisfied! rudy the owner, looked over my car and was very knowledgeable. i have a 2013 black camry that i was concerned about the smoothness of the finish and swirl marks that someone previously left. rough feeling paint when it was still shiny. rudy and his team clay barred, multiple polish and finished. i highly recommend his shop! totally honest and highly experienced. i will be a repeat customer forever on and i drive from fountain hills! back to black with deep rich color and stand out flakes. right off the show room floor look! thank you rudy! makes me want to dukes of hazzard across my hood! but wont lol. leave it to sport auto detail to do a great job!
rudy and his crew did a great job detailing my 2011 chevy tahoe.  price was fair and service was outstanding, they cleaned my vehicle from top to bottom and spared no details.  engine compartment looked brand new after cleaning, interior was spotless, leather looked great, they even cleaned and touched up any scratches and wheel wells.  i would definitely recommend to anyone in need of a good car detail service.  i will definitely be a repeat customer.thanks rudy
i had the opportunity to attend the soft opening at snooze this morning. im impressed, to say the least!  the food is delicious, great atmosphere, super friendly staff and i love the energy. my sister and i ordered a pancake flight pineapple upside down, blueberry and strawberry shortcake. they were all amazing. we also ordered a duo benedict caprese and chilaquiles as well as a breakfast pot pie cant remember the exact name. our server, dylan, was informative, friendly, accommodating and fun. i cant complain about anything. whoever said you snooze, you lose, has never been to the snooze eatery. cheesy, i know. i cant wait to return! :
i rate this a five star.  nice upbeat environment, superb service with a flare for attention to providing you with an enjoyable and memorable eating  experience.  wide variety of enticing dishes, with a choice of adventuresome drinks.  kids menus are available and a veteran discount is available.
i came here the day it opened at around 8:00 am, and i loved the ambience!  the service was great, as well. i ordered the o.m.g. french toast, which was out of this world!  i was afraid it would be too sweet, with the mascarpone and salted caramel sauce, but there was just a little of each, so it was perfect.  i love the patio in the back, and the fact that you can play cornhole and ping pong.  i had been to the tempe location several times, so i was excited that one was opening right by my house.  i love everything that ive ever ordered at snooze.  it does not disappoint!
just had breakfast at snooze. i have been stalking this place for months so you could say i was pretty excited. it did not disappoint! i had the pancake flight which was amazing!!! the blueberry danish and strawberry shortcake were so fresh and full of flavor, it was like dessert for breakfast. my husband had the benny duo with the bella bella and the benny goodman which he loved. the eggs were perfectly poached. my sons kids plate was pretty impressive. it came with fresh fruit and a mini version of the hash browns. our server arianna was great! super attentive and on the ball. all in all it was everything we were hoping for and more.
this place is wonderful!  best breakfast place we have been to in the east valley. not a negative thing to say and couldnt find an area needing improvement; hope they sustain this level of customer satisfaction. the menu for food and drink is varied and very flavorful. my wife had the eggs benedict and liked the concept of mixing two choices from the selection. i had the sweet potato pancakes with a side of bacon;  incredible! the cocktails we had were flavorful and reasonably priced. we shall return many times and look forward to those visits.
went for the first time this morning with my daughter and her boyfriend food was great service was awesome. the only problem i had was making a selection off of the menu it all looked so good. definitely my new favorite breakfast spot!
the food at this establishment is definitely worth the wait for a table. the eggs benedict combinations are unique, and each one ive tried so far has been exquisite. the mimosas are also delightful, with different juices to choose from and the perfect champagne to compliment them. the atmosphere is light and fun, and it is the perfect place to meet friends or bring a family. the staff too, from the hostess to the bussers, are energetic and easy going. this is definitely my goto place for brunch.
its only been open a few weeks and ive eaten here twice. both times food was yummy. pancakes were heavily. the burrito is gigantic and enough for two people.  the yummy breakfast sandwich on a pretzel bun, with bacon, avocado, and egg is goodness. i love my iced tea and theirs was great. staff was fun, energetic, happy, helpful. will be back.
one word..... bomb!!!!this place is so good.. the omg french toast, the chilaqullas benedict and everything was amazing... very happy
i really like snooze, so im happy to now have one in my neighborhood.  ive already visited this location a few times and id have to say it gets better every time.  on my last visit, i had the omg.  it was the bomb.  i also had an iced caramel mocha, which also was the bomb.  the wait staff and baristas, bomb.  even the managers, bomb.i will be back soon and often.thank you!
i dont want to give them a great review because the wait for a seat will get longer. pancakes are phenomenal!!! staff is friendly and awesome. chiliquiles breakfast was delicious!!
i have eaten breakfast at snooze twice since it opened.  i wish i could eat there every day!  the restaurant is absolutely beautifully designed and decorated right down to the last detail.  there is seating inside and patio seating outside for when the weather is cooler.  the menu is filled with interesting and unique offerings along with more traditional breakfast items.  i will admit to being a coffee snob, and the coffee at snooze is very very good.  i understand that it is a single grower variety that the ceo of snooze tracked down himself by going to the source.  i have tried their sweet potato pancakes with pecans and ginger butter yes, ginger butter! as well as the benny duoyour choice of any two benedicts with the luscious caprese benedict and the chile verde benny.  i loved the caprese benedict and will definitely order it again.  my companion has tried several other benedicts including the bella bella and the benny goodman.  he said the salmon one the benny goodman was his favorite.  they also offer a pancake of the day, which on both of our visits sounded perhaps a little too sweet, even for someone with a sweet tooth, like me.  service is relaxed but attentive.  prices are comparable to other breakfast restaurants in the area.  i highly recommend snooze!!
if i could give our waitress 10 stars i would! stacey thanks for being an amazing and hands down the best waitress! she was very very nice, she helped my friend choose one pancake out and she said you guys have to try the sweet potato one! my friend was nervous itd taste like sweet potato and stacey was so sure shed like it that she bought us it! the waitress bought us a pancake to try, just because she was so confident about it...an oh goodness im glad she did! it was amazing ! yes the restaurant was noisy, especially being sat by the front door but i could still hear my friend talking across from me without yelling. we were also surprised at 12:30 on a monday was busy! we only wait 20 mins so it was fine. i did the duo eggs benedict and it was delicious! i really like this place, the one in tempe is also good service. i will be back just because of stacey.
snooze was so good!! we had an order for our office and the order was correct and still hot! i had the banana nutella french toast and ive never had anything better. highly recommend this place !
been here twice and we have enjoyed everything we have tried! i love the variety of the pancake of the day option with your entree and the pancakes are amazing !! the food is high quality !! dont miss the benedicts !! the staff is so friendly! if you show up and there is a wait .. they have a little grass area off of the back patio with table tennis and beanbag toss game! stop snoozing and give snooze a try !! it wont disappoint !!
my fiance and i visited snooze on a saturday around noon and it was packed. hostess quoted us 3040 minutes. it ended up being about an hour, but in all fairness we only wanted to sit inside because they didnt have misters and it was hot. it was first time at snooze and our sever arianna surprised us with their strawberry shortcake pancake. it was awesome. i got the pancake flight and tried the blueberry danish pancake, the pineapple upside down cake pancake and a normal chocolate chip pancake. all were so fluffy and delightful. for me the pineapple upside down cake would be one to skip in be future but i fell in love with the other ones. also had a mimosa with pomegranate liquor and that was refreshing. my fiance got something called snooze spud deluxe or something like that and he really enjoyed it as well. he got the kentucky coffee too and said it was good if you like strong espresso. arianna was so sweet. she gave us the perfect amount of attention. after the wait we had i was nervous about our server being too busy but she really took care of us. we will definitely be back!!
what an awesome place. the food is great with some offering spins put on it. the wait staff can and will tell you enthusiastically were the ingredients and products they use come from. definitely a sense of pride here what for they are putting out.  location is also great. cant wait to go back.
from start to finish perfection. our server jessica was absolutely delightful . she knew everything and more about the menu and was spot on with her recommendations. the food not only danced with flavors it did a tango in my mouth. a well orchestrated symphony with each and every bite!!!!!
everything ive tried here has been pretty darn amazing! yes they have a long wait and are very busy, especially if you go on a weekend, but the food and friendliness of the staff is worth the wait to me.
delicious and great service.  you must try the pineapple pancakes. went on tuesday just after 830 am no wait.
this is one of the best eateries me and my wife have ever ate at my wife has gluten allergy and they do all gluten breakfast manager ramon is about one of the best , ride along with the staff couldnt ask for a better place to eat in the morning thanks guys . terry  julie
been here a few times now and everything has always been awesome!! amy took care of us today. she was awesome! cant think of a better way to spend a friday morning with my wife! thanks snooze!
so amazing. the breakfast tacos are the best! you must come...request jason when you do, he makes the experience all worth it.
i have enjoyed many dining establishments over the years.  i must say that my guest and i were truly amazed by this eatery.  i was a bit concerned when we arrived to find the wait was going to be 55 to 70 minutes.  i will now say, it would have been worth the wait, had we waited that long.  they get your phone number and text you when your table is almost ready.  i received a text at the 40 minute mark.once seated, we were greeted by alissa, within 3 to 5 minutes.  she took excellent care us.  the restaurant has only been open 1 month  8 days.  alissas knowledge of the menu and appropriate questions, helped guide us to a delicious meal.  we wanted to try a variety of items, and alissa offered several suggestions.  we experienced the flight of pancakes, 3 different ones,  the breakfast pot pie amazing, and the benedict duo 2 options of their amazing eggs benedict.  the vine ripe bloody mary was great such fresh ingredients, as was the mmm mmm mimosa, which alissa wouldnt let me order unless i said the mmm mmm first.  fresh, delicious food. if you love breakfast, you will love snooze.i have never written a review for a restaurant before today.  snooze definitely earned this review, and i wish them much success. i cant wait to return for another round with alissa, and to introduce more diners to this wonderful restaurant.
so completely blown away! snoozes incredible, high quality, fresh twist on breakfast favorites, such as hash browns and pecan pancakes, is enough to equate to a five star rating. now add snooze originals like breakfast pot pie, and egg, pico, and cheese breakfast tacos. yum!! though i have to say, the thing that completely set my experience apart was the outstanding service. our server was jason over at the gilbert location. he was incredibly personable, energetic, and treated us like we were the only ones there. this guy seriously made our experience at snooze and we will be back soon!
enjoyed their mmm mmm mimosa with a pancake flight. pineapple upside down, sweet potato, banana foster, strawberry shortcake; all amazing! very much enjoyed our breakfast! just wish the wait to get a table wasnt always do long! it was nice that they take your cell number and text when your tables ready.
great food, great experience, great service. sat down right away on a sunday morning. our waiter was prompt and explained the menu. they had a special pancake of the day which was a white chocolate chip mint one. we said that sounds good and waiter responded with ill bring one out on me just so you can try it. that was amazing. 5 minutes later our free pancake rolled out. it was amazing, and almost had a crispy waffle like crust. we also ordered a sweet potato pancake, and strawberry one. my wife ordered the duo of capersee and regular eggs benedict. both were amazing. i had the mushroomham scramble. fresh good mushrooms and big chunks of ham. coffee was amazing, and always topped off. when we were getting our check they even offered coffees to go.  i see other reviews of poor service, but we had the best service ive had in a long time. new places typically have a few growing pains first few weeks. either we lucked out, or the service has gotten a lot better since the other reviews. by far the best breakfast ive had in arizona since moving here.
absolutely delicious. great college atmosphere, super friendly staff, great selection. i had the pretzel bun sandwich thingy, with the hollandaise sauce. perfection.
today was our second experience at snooze.  it was great to find that the first visit wasnt a fluke.  the food just as delicious as the first time.  the staff also as wonderful.  we were lucky to have blonde jessica be our server.  she was very personable and took excellent care of us.  she was engaging and helpful in our decisions.  we were also lucky to have katie at the restaurant serving as well.  this was a blast from the past, as she and i have  worked in the same facility before.  to have a serve recognize you and come to your table to ensure your breakfast is going well, is service at its finest.  it didnt stop there.  our server alissa from our first visit was also there, and made her way to the table to say hi and catch up.  she genuinely seemed happy to see that we had returned.  i promise the craziness didnt stop there.  we also received a visit from the manager, ramon.  he did well to remember 50 of our names, mine, which of course is the most important.  i have read through all of the reviews for this location.  there some good and some bad.  my words to you would be, give snooze a try.  there are a lot of people out there that are just mad at the world, and have extremely high expectations of others.  i encourage you to sit down relax and be kind.  the food is good, and the entire team there really does want to make you enjoy your visit.  let he or she, without faults, cast the first stone.  every new establishment has to go through growing pains, no matter how many locations they have.  new locations have to work out kinks.  this crew is trying to do it right and if you work with them, the experience will be great.  we live in a world where it is difficult to make people happy.  food should be a time to gather, relax and enjoy.thank you to jessica, katie, alissa and ramon.  you are all great and wish you much success.  see you next time.
relaxed and retrochic atmosphere.i had the ridiculously good banana nutella situation. the fluffy brioche french toast made the ideal base for the extremely creamy and flavorful  banana and nutella cream sauces. toasted nuts and plantain chips balance out the sweetness and creaminess.
yesterday was our first time at snooze.  our friend recommended the place,  he was right.  everyone was friendly,  we didnt have to wait long on a sunday morning. our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  i love it that the menu is small, to the point. we ordered the benedict duo and pancakes flight. so delicious.  needless to say our plates were clean.  we would definitely come back.
love this place! the wait is well worth it every time! today katie was our server and blew us away. we was very knowledgeable of the menu and anticipated our needs before we could even ask. the restaurant was very busy but she was alway attentive and super friendly! with both of us being in the industry this was very refreshing! thank you katie! we will make sure to request her every time!
i love the omg! french toast. but, i dont know if you should get it. i want you to be able to enjoy other french toasts in the future. i didnt even know what marscarpone was and now i wont ever forget it. thanks obama!
hands down best breakfast ive had in az. a little pricey but so worth it for elevated breakfast cuisine. i had the benny duo and my boyfriend had a special. both were amazing. service at the bar was fun. well skip this place on the weekends because its chaotic but 8am on a monday was perfect. it was getting busy and there was a wait by the time we left.
45 minutes waiting time on a busy saturday morning. food was yummy! fresh! hash browns. unique flavor. triple berry jam. oh my heavenly. even my picky eater daughter loves this place! angel was our server. very nice lady. a perfect way to start our saturday morning.
came in at 12:30 on a saturday and the place was packed! it was a 30 minute wait for a party of 2 but was well worth it! i ordered the benny duo with bella bella benny and the chile verde benny. both turned out fantastic, the poached eggs were perfect. i upgraded my hash brown to a pancake and went with the blueberry danish pancake. it was large and fluffy! they also have a good drink selection, i got a brewmosa with my meal.
took my best friend out this morning a saturday for a birthday breakfast, and we had a great experience! we arrived at 6:45 am, there were a couple guests already seated inside. it was a nice morning, so we requested outdoor seating. absolutely no wait this early in the morning, even on a weekend! : i ordered cranberry juice a little pricey at 3 for a very small glass  my only complaint  she had coffee. then i ordered the pancake flight i chose pineapple upside a down, strawberry shortcake  the chocolatecinnamonpecan special of the day  heavenly! my friend ordered the omg french toast  raved over it! the bill was 26 for us both. service was very quick and super courteous! will be back!
so ive been to snooze enough times to finally write a review.  ive been to this location once, town  country camelbacks location a number of times, san diego, and even the location in colorado where it first originated.  im giving some love to this one since its not saturated with 500 or 2000 or even 3000 san diego reviews yet.  that 3000 speaks volume.  but i can say that my review for all the snooze locations have been pretty even across the board in terms of quality in the making and creations of such deliciousness!  the service for me in all locations have been wonderful for such a busy breakfast hang out spot.  luckily, they do provide complimentary coffee to their awaiting hangry customers.  you will wait and thats no surprise!  however, the bar does provide fistcomefirstserve seating.  grab away, but try not to hoover over the people still trying to enjoy their brunch or company.  ill try to remember what ive devoured in lump sum.  ill start with my favorite off the savory.  i love their benedicts!  being indecisive at times, they do give you the benny duo option, which means half of one choice and half of another.  i have tried them all! yes all!  i usually would go for the most interesting versus common benedict.  the chile verde benedict pulled pork is probably my favorite for more of a daring meaty option.  its not spicy, which is good for me.  and if youre just not feeling for something heavy, i would definitely recommend the caprese benedict heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella.  very light and refreshing for a benedict, yet full of flavor! something about that balsamic reduction brings it together!  but really, any choice you cant go wrong with.  if you didnt like it, my bad.  dont be picky! moving on, the quinoa porridge!  yes!  as strange as it sounds, its actually pretty good to me.  dont know what quinoa is?  then that means you should try it once.  it looks like oatmeal from afar mixed in with oats.  texture is similar to oatmeal.  its got some sweetness of pecans, lemon shortbread, and fresh strawberries to mix in with.  probably a perfect dish for my fellow lulu lemon heads.  i have also had their simple 3 eggs whites scrambled entree.  it comes with hash browns, toast, and choice of meat.  this is very simple and yet still delicious.  a perfect option for your plain janes and joe schmos out there.  and finally, the pancakes and french toast!  the omg french toast is quite sweet and huge!  its got strawberries, mascarpone, and sweet sauces of caramel and vanilla creme drizzled.  this was shared as a dessert.  now the pancakes....same problem with the benedicts.  cant decide?  there is a flight of 3 option.  you can pick and choose your top 3 victims.  they are smaller in size, but worth the taste of 3 pancakes.  the one i cant get enough of is the pineapple upside down pancake!  mmmmmmm!!  if you do order that as a single choice option, you will get 2 of them the size enough to cover your face.  down it down with some of that chai iced latte and you are set!
the art of hollandaise is incredible! pretty noisy but the food is worth it. the drink menu is fantastic.
cant comment on coffee because it never came pancakes french toast was dry hopefully other food is better i will not find out this is a one time stop for me.  very noisy and service well let me put it this way his teeth were beautiful but not the service well went back with a different friend both us us vowed never to return and we have not. today i am at the hillcrest snooze in san diego well worth the 5 12 drive there food makes you feel like you are in heaven and the staff there is fun friendly and on top of things. i can actually say now that the coffee is great at snooze i got it in san diego well i am back in gilbert hoping that the third time is a charm and i have to say it was.  angel our server was wonderful we both have 3 different kinds of benedict and a cinnamon roll pancake all was wonderful. i will surely come back and no i did not take the managers offer previously for the meal on them
delicious food and what a selection. everything ive had on my first few visits has been excellent! service is a tad slow but the guys ive had as servers have all been friendly and very helpful with recommendations.
bomb! great food, great service!went here for breakfast and got the snooze burrito.. it was a cool atmosphere and a great vibe. the servers are attentive to your needs and i will be back!
first of all, i have to say how amazing the follow up from management was following my previous review. they were professional and prompt in getting us taken care of and addressing each of our concerns. we went back today for breakfast and the food was outstanding. service was prompt and friendly. we will absolutely be coming back! well done snooze!! previous review: ok so i have to preface that this review is not for the food. we didnt actually have a chance to eat the food because everything else was so terrible.we arrived at 8:30am on a sunday to grab a breakfast with the kids. we quoted 30 minutes wait for a table. not a problem at all! took the kids across the street to grab some coffee from bergies and to wait. after 40 minutes, go back to check on our time. still a wait....30 minutes after that we finally are sat at a table. after a little bit our server comes over she was very nice but could tell she was hot and stressed out. we place our food and drink order right away together. we wait 40 minutes and food still isnt there. server is no where to be found. water is empty. its now been almost 2 hours since we first arrived and still no food or anything. we ended up getting up from our table and just leaving. i tried to find our server to let her know but again...nowhere to be found. i would highly suggest hiring enough staff to handle the demand you clearly have! i dont know if we will ever attempt to eat here again but if we do, ill update my review.
i got here pretty early on a weekday  a little before 8am  and it wasnt crowded at all. however, over the next 90 minutes, the place filled up almost completely. thats a pretty good sign, but also a good thing to keep in mind: if you can get out of bed early, do it and youll spend far less time waiting and more time eating!i started off with coffee, which was hot and had good flavor. it was kept constantly topped off and warm bonus points!i read through the whole menu. twice. i finally narrowed it down to 4 options and then chose the first one of those so that it would be easy to keep track of which one i already had ordered  see? planning ahead.i had the corned beef hash with two eggs and rye toast. the corned beef was awesome. if youre also a fan, this is worth it. the reuben sandwich is probably amazing, too, since id imagine it uses the same flavorful, fallapart beef product and thickcut rye bread.since it was my first time there i guess this is a thing?, the server brought us a pancake to try. it was their signature pineapple upside down pancake  that was one of the options on my short list more bonus points!... and it was excellent. if you are familiar with places that make heavy pancakes, this is not one of those. the pancake was large, about the size of the plate, but light. the addins and toppings werent overpowering, either. so many times, youll get a nice pancake, but it is almost floating in syrup, butter, or whoknowswhat topping im looking at you, ihop!. not so here. i think the ratio was very well balanced.there is so much good stuff on the menu that i couldnt order it all in one sitting. well, i could order all of it, but my attempt to eat all of it would not be pretty ... so, i guess i have to go back twist my arm, you know? now that ive checked it out, and the weather is cooling off, i am looking forward to taking the family here. did i mention that they have outdoor seating on the back patio? woo hoo!
5 stars !!! the food is amazing !! sweet potato pancake and omg french toast is to die for . the staff is awesome, bianca is the best !
loved this restaurant!!! the waiters and waitresses were super polite and tentative. the coffee was strong enough and the food was pleasing to the palate. it is perfect to take the family. they have outdoor seating and is nice early in the morning. this place is definitely all around trendy.
we will be going back to this location. the people are super friendly and the cooks are amazing. try the am manhattan and the dharma rum. also, im pretty sure there isnt a bad item in this menu.
went on a tuesday and it was pretty darned good. the dining room was pretty much full when i arrived, it looked like it might be slowing down as i was getting ready to leave, about 1130ish. the server amy was very friendly and knowledgable. she answered all the questions my friend and i threw her way. i ordered the fall harvest benedict while my friend had the huevos rancheros. both items were tasty and hot! as for drinks, we stuck with coffees and water even though there are recommendations on here to check out the alcoholic drinks, just figured it might be a smidge too early to be drinking on a tuesday. we were checked on just the right amount of times by the serving staff, not too little but not too many where you feel bothered. the wait staff here seems to truly like what they do, countless smiles thoughout our meal.
been twice good service,food,and prices will be going back. nice sized outdoor eating areas on street side and in back.
i couldnt decide between the blueberry pancakes and the pumpkin. the waiter suggested one of each, which i found a wonderful option....until 2 pancakes the size of my head arrived. oh my, way too much, but delish! oh....go with the blueberry......yum!
i go here frequently. i always try to order something new but struggle since ive always loved my previous orders. wish it stayed open later!
we will be going back to this location. the people are super friendly and the cooks are amazing. try the am manhattan and the dharma rum. also, im pretty sure there isnt a bad item in this menu. update: these people get cooler and cooler every time you come here!!! this is a must visit for breakfastbrunch!!!! try the mmm mmm mimosa too. everything on this menu is to die for.
5 million stars for this cute little place ! i had the drunken punken pancakes 7.50 the pannycakes were as big as the plate . the pumpkin pie spice was strong  proud , mixed with the velvety cream cheese .. this was a definite party on a plate  coffee was great and served with real cream . i cant wait to come back and try one of the benedict items
incredible pancakes. you can make your own with  a flight. also infuse their own vodka for bloody marys.
a new weekend date spot for my husband and myself. they can make anything delicious. i cant wait until saturday, as a matter of fact. im glad we stumbled on this little gem.
the food was to die for! my friend had breakfast pot pie and loved it. i had the pick 2 eggs benedict. the salmon was amazing!! barbacoa was really good but out shined by the salmon. breakfast cocktails were also tasty. service was good. no complaints at all. we both look forward to coming back.
it was 11 on a friday; no wait.  i was seated right away even though i was still waiting for a friend so maybe the complaints about not being seated until the whole party arrived has to do with really busy times! fun, energetic servers... the food was delicious!  my friend had a benedict duo and i had a breakfast burrito.  it really was a great time.
i was impressed with the food and service the first time i came to snooze. i was excited to bring my family back while they were in town visiting for thanksgiving. our experience was quite different than the first time i had been there. we waited forever for our meals to come out and when they did they were cold. we were disappointed because the flavor of everything was great. we had mentioned this to our waitress and she said she would let her manager know. just a a couple of minutes later the manager came over and said that our meal was on him. we were so impressed by the customer service. he was gracious and grateful we had come in. i will definitely be back because they know how to take care of their customers. thanks snoozers!
absolutely loved snooze! the food was delicious and they were completely accommodating to my husbands allergy to gluten. i would highly recommend this great breakfast place in gilbert!
located strategically just outside pittsburgh 2 minutes from 2 lane country pastoral roads.  i ride a lot, this was one of my favorite rides ever.  i love the team at eagle, the rented quick, were way cool, water t shirts friendship. just go take a stinking amazing ride!
been to many eagle riders... but this one was hands down the best! they went way above and beyond for me. cannot wait to come back!
paul, mike and the team are awesome.  we used pittsburgh as the starting point for our trip down to ashevillemaggie valley to ride the tail of the dragon, the cherohala skyway, the snake and the back of the dragon as well as much, much more.  the bmws were clean and ready to go upon our arrival.  check in was very quick and we were on the road fast.  a week later we were back and the return was fast.  their location is very convenient to the airport.  were psyched that there is a bmw rental shop finally in the pittsburgh area and were already planning our next trip to the area.  this is a great shop in a great location with great folks that set us up for what was an epic week of riding.
as good as it gets. ive rented from various companies from san francisco to maui and ride regularly at home bmw r1200r. i always wanted to try out the bmw k1600gt and to my surprise they had one for me to rent. i spent a week on this bike and it did not disappoint. they also had gsas, rts, and others by bmw. also had a wide selection of harleys and indian. bottom line, if you want a convenient location short hop from the airport, clean bikes, and topshelf concierge service, look no further. they are cool, quick, efficient, and go out of their way to make sure you maximize ride time. thanks paul and mike for setting us up.i uploaded a photo from the tail of the dragon. that bike inspired a lot of confidence :craig.
generally speaking, i dont get cravings for sweets and desserts like how i do with  pho and ramen.  if i were to ever get the urge though, theres a pretty good chance it would be for a delicious, french macaron.  well, other than ice cream of course.  or a fresh, homemade chocolate chip cookie.  a thin one, with slightly crisp edges, a golden brown bottom, and a soft, chewy center with plenty of melted chocolate chips.  yeaaaaahhhhh, thatd be good....wait, what was i talking about?while most french bakeries offer up smaller, near bitesized macarons, i love how bouchons are almost the size of your palm.  even though that means you pay a little more for each cookie, it also means you have that much more to enjoy.  and enjoy you will, with a light, crisp exterior sandwiching a sweet and chewy filling.  although ive yet to try the pistacio flavor myself, ive heard plenty of good things about it from friends.  for me, my favorite has been their espresso macaron  loaded with a rich, coffee flavor, it won me over after just one bite.since this bouchon bakery is really more of an outletcoffee stand in the venetian by the theater, the selection is smaller compared to what their actual bakery locations can offer.  however, it still tastes just as good, and thats what matters most, right?  after all, if you start to crave a macaron, its better to be stuck choosing from just a few varieties than to not have any to choose from at all!
i believe they have the best macarons! ive had plenty since my wife loves them. this is the second time weve gotten them and theyve been just as tasty! they arent your normal size either.
a great little hideaway place with some fantastic bread and drinks to go with it, a perfect way to start your fun vegas day with a nice breakfast, or if you are in the mood they have some wonderful seafood plats also.in other words you need to swing by and give this place a shot you be glad you did.
believe it or not, and after 11 visits to bouchon bistro at the venetian, i finally made my first visit to this bouchon bakery location, where epic macarons and chocolate bouchons can be found to satisfy your sweet tooth after an epic meal at bouchon.  ive already had the macarons at their yountville location which i still ordered on this visit, but this was actually my first time trying a chocolate bouchon, which is essentially a small brownie but it was really delicious!  i dig this new location in front of the resort near the clock tower on the far west entrance as its much easier to spot than their old location inside the resort which apparently i never found.  its a great location for people watching in the morning or afternoon since they have a small outdoor patio, but even if its full, there are plenty of benches in the area as well.  quick tip:  if you dine at bouchon, show your receipt here for 25 off any baked goods.  thats an awesome deal!  i will definitely stop by here again for more macarons!!
nice place to get speciality french bakery items. we tried all the 6 flavors of macarons. salted caramel okok, vanilla and raspberry good, coffee and pistachio yummy, chocolate yummiest. we even got the chocolatecovered raspberry but asked the guy over the checkout to exchange it for something else as we were pretty unhappy with our plain raspberry and didnot even want to open and try it. he happily did that and gave us 2 we just asked for 1 of our favorite macarons. nice touch which just adds to the name of bouchon bakery.the staff is pretty honest about when the macarons are made and which are fresher. i would happily gulp down chocolate , coffee or pistachio again.
excellent macarons. rankings best  okay:1. chocolate2. coffee3. vanilla4. pistachio5. raspberry6. caramelthe staff and the service is excellent. must visit!
great little spot for a quick sweet treat or your caffeine fix while on the busy vegas strip!  very pleasant  helpful staff. nice quaint little patio seating on the outside the perfect area to read a book or people watch all day long!
i have dreams about the chocolate almond croissant.  bouchon bakery is one of our must stop places on each visit to the las vegas strip.  grab a coffee and pastry, take a seat outside at one of the five or six tables available and spend the next 30 minutes people watching.
words cannot express how highly i think of this lender lol. my husband and i are 1st time homeowners. we started the process at the end of july. we started out with a different lender and we were very unsatisfied with her. it was a negative experience from the beginning with  the old lender! i found steve on yelp but with a different company not supreme lending. i scheduled an appointment with steve at supreme lending because the reviews were very impressive. he was able to sit with me and answer any questions that we had one on one. he was very upfront about everything. he responded to any of my texts , calls or emails. we closed on our house within one month after seeing steve. i cannot say enough.  he made this a great experience!!!   i wish i wouldve seen him from the beginning of the process! i would recommend them to my own mother. thanks steve, cindy and robyn. you guys are awesome.
i am grateful i found mr. lee, i actually found him on yelp after going through a few other horrible mortgage professionals. i expressed to him what i needed and that i expected fast response times. he was the best at responding quickly, knew what he was talking about and to have the expertise in the field so i trusted him. he definitely pulled through and made me a satisfied first time home buyer. i am the pain in the butt customer that questions everything and expects answers asap. mr. lee was patient with me and thoroughly explained things so i could understand them.
steve and his coworker scott were awesome from start to end. they were able to close within 3 weeks which i hear is pretty fast. great communication, constant updates but not bombarding us with pointless details. steve even showed up at our final signing to ensure that everything was in order. rates  also excellent and lender fees very very reasonable compared to other lenders. would definitely recommend steve and his company to other firsttime homebuyers like myself.
wow!!!  check this new place out. family owned. food is amazing. great wine selection. located where daniels was thank god that place is history.  great attitude to go with the awesome food!!go to this new place soon and often!!
im glad i am the second review because my wife and i were the second customers yesterday for lunch for the opening.   what a great place to eat!  the owners are amazing and have a great story. everything is locally grown, fresh and organic.   we look forward to our second visit.
wow this place just opened and i feel so lucky to have been in town! i forgot her name but the tall red headed lady was very nice and told us that all the food is locally sourced and organic! the pizza was delicious and i added artichokes artichokes are my fav.  the pear and rocket salad was delicious and tasted like it was straight off the farm.
great local pizza place served up by 3 australians and an american! white truffle pizza with a napa smith make for a great dinner :
i try to wait at least a month before trying a new restaurant so that their kinks can be worked out. after reading all of the great reviews i decided to take a chance on base pizzeria, and im very glad that i did! my husband and i came here for dinner last night and were instantly welcomed by the owner as we walked through the door. the owners were so friendly, engaging and nice! theyre very passionate about their business and it shows. the menu consists of mostly pizza, salad, a few appetizers and they have a variety of wine, bottled beer and spirits from arizona distilling company. everything they have is organic and locally sourced. i always love being able to support local!we chose the crispy proscuitto salad and the el diablo pizza with a pinot noir for me and a kellerweiss for my husband. i had ordered the pinot noir on the menu board, but was also given a taste of a bottle which they already had open. i ended up liking the tasting better than the one i had ordered, and will keep that in mind for next time. it was great that they had offered it to me so i could discover something new. the salad and pizza arrived quickly and both were fresh and wonderfully flavored. the proscuitto on the salad was crisped to perfection almost like a super thin bacon, all of the veggies were fresh and the strawberry balsamic vinaigrette had just the right bite. the el diablo pizza had a slightly sweet hand crushed tomato sauce, which was very light and tasted of perfectly ripened tomatoes. the sopressata was delicate on spice, just enough to not overpower any of the other flavors. high quality kalamata olives and roasted peppers made for a wellrounded dish. i would not hesitate to order either of these again.in a neighborhood with tons of pizza options available you would think that they would have some stiff competition. with the high quality organic ingredients that theyre using, incredibly welcoming service and delicious food, base pizzeria is a step above the rest. i have no worries that theyll be successful and i cant wait to try the rest of the menu. props to them for putting together such a welloiled machine in such a short amount of time.
fabulous staff and amazing food.  i highly recommend the pear and rocket salad! !! clean, organic, and gluten free food. family friendly or a great place to bring a date.  if youre looking to hear some awesome australian accents....this is the place.  we will definitely be back!
amazing!!! we are from san diego and have traveled and had pizza around the world and this spectacular family run place is in the running to be one of our favorites!!! carly and rossco are fabulous! so fun, personable, and downright adorable!!! we are so thrilled we stumbled on this gem!!! we would highly recommend this cute place! even our kids were fighting over who would finish the last piece!!!!
at base pizzeria what you will feel is simple  local, organic and a sense of community. walking in the door you instantly get a feeling of being part of the family and as if you are hanging out with friends and the locals. the added bonus is the organic pizza is some of the best phoenix has to offer.
awesome spot. like all the other reviews  u feel like you are family there. went with two other friends of mine and we all had a great time. our server male brother. forgot his name is hilarious and was really personable from the start. we did two pizzas and a salad and we all left full but not food coma full. pizza was very good, service was excellent. definitely coming back
great new pizzeria!breathing life into what used to be a stuffy, overpriced restaurant, base pizzeria is refreshingly down to earth. a family run business, consisting of a quartet of hilarious aussies brother and sister duo of roscoe and carly are most visible, the staff are friendly, funny, and genuinely passionate about their food. they take obvious pride in their locally sourced, organic ingredients and are not shy about offering a taste of this and that.  you feel as though you just stopped in to share a meal with your own familyright down to roscoe teasing hubs about not finishing the last bite of proscuitto, which drew quite a laugh from our table after he mowed down practically an entire cutting board of charcuterie. we had the charcuterie very impressive amount of food, bread was amazing and the meats and cheese were tasty and filling, the base pizza picky hubs even ate the crust, a first, and the crispy proscuitto saladdeliciousness. the tomatoes used on the pizza are second to none and the brick oven adds that smoky, delicious flavor. tasty, fresh food, warm and welcoming staff, and easy to get in and out of this location. superb addition to local lineup and pleased to support a true neighborhood restaurant!
wow, outstanding service and incredibly flavored base pizza tomato  basil  crispy prosciutto salad.  did i mention the gluten free crust tastes fantastic?  it does.  highly recommend this local, family owned restaurant to anyone wanting a fun, tasty lunch or dinner!
i was there last night and the bar was packed. pizza was amazing!!!! tastes very fresh  the sauce is yum. and i am a pizza connoisseur.
dinner was delicious.bruchetta for appetizerstrawberry saladpiggy pizzachook pizzanutella pizzafrench press dessertambiance was nice for our group to chat and catch up.  waiter attentive, but not hovering.loved it.
my first and only yelp review.  this place is awesome!  great pizza, apps, and beer.  modern without being pretentious.  this will easily be one of the top 3 pizzas in the city.  try the plough mans platter....fantastic.  will definitely be a regular stop.
my hubby and i stopped in here on a saturday afternoon for a post manipedi late afternoon nosh, we were welcomed in by the owners who were so friendly and helpful.  we decided to split a salad and pizza, we ordered the crispy prosciutto salad and the piggy pizza, both were absolutely delicious!!!  i am a lactard so pizza isnt normally my thing but this pizza is cheeseless it comes with some shaved parm on top, easy fix i seriously have never felt so strongly about a pizza before it was absolutely perfect!!! i cant wait to go back here!
every time i go to base pizzeria, the moment k walk in the door, im greeted like a guest in their home! its wonderful. then i have a seat at a table and i am immediately greeted with water and menu. perfect. everything in the pizzeria is organic for those of you who enjoy that aspect, but one thing i love and appreciate about base pizzeria is the fact that i can eat pizza and not feel as if i just broke my diet plan. the veggies are fresh and amazingly delicious. the salads are amazing. they put care into their product. they are consistently serving me great customer service, great food, and great organic margaritas! i will continue to come back, i will spread the word like wild fire.
new neighborhood spot which recently opened. very comfortable and relaxed setting. the white pizza was fantastic, it was perfectly creamy and cheesy while not being too overdone. i actually preferred their pizza to some of the other neighborhood hot spots.. lgo, the parlor etc. good variety of pizza, salad and apps with great service.
base pizzeria happens to be right next to the nail salon my wife is fond of, which is where we were today. i was done with my pedi first, so i wandered over to check out our new neighborhood pizzeria. i wasnt hungry, but good pizza is not as common as one might believe, so i was very interested in the place. from the moment i walked through the door, i was impressed. the owners, a couple of aussie brothersinlaw, were genuinely nice guys, and immediately made me feel welcome. i liked the place. personable owners involved in their business are critically important to achieving success. they had that covered, hands down. but base is a pizzeria, and the pizza had better be good. especially since there is no pasta or wings. i ordered a simple cheese pizza. thumbs up! seriously good pizza. all of it. the crust, the sauce, and the cheese. really good. my wife wandered over when she was done with her mani, pedi, and ordered the hummus. another hit. very good stuff. base pizzeria will be in our restaurant rotation. they are very convenient for us, i would encourage anyone to give it a try, even if its a bit of a drive. it will be worth it.
such good food, great mountain view and super nice staff
delishhhhh. yummy champagne! the dips and pita, the pizza, crispy prosciutto salad, and the bonnie dessert banana bread with ice cream....absolutely to live for. the atmosphere is lovely and the owners are fantastic. everyone must go and indulge in some deliciousness
excellent food and service! they have a great wine selection and all fresh, organic  ingredients for their delicious food the prawn and the mediterranean pizzas are my personal favorites. they can accommodate any dietary need too! will definitely go back!!!
hitting on all cylinders already.  the wood fired oven is kept hot enough to get a nice leopard spot pattern of char marks on the bottom and a crisp texture to the dough.  unlike some pizzerias that leave a huge thick doughy edge with no toppings around the perimeter, base covers the entire pizza and does not have the extra thick edge.  i liked that!the pizza choices include classics and a few of their own, with optional add ons.  all the ingredients are organic, very fresh and delicious.the wine list is not extensive but very good and well matched to the vibe and the food.  a full bar stands by along one side of the dining room.  when the weather cools off, the patio will be first choice, having great views of the mountain preserve.the three aussie owners are all fun and friendly.  two mates and one cheeky sheila.  we expect to become regulars at this great neighborhood spot.
very cool new pizza place  aussie owners again 2nd new place this week!  they were very nice and very friendly.we started with the pear and rockets salad arugula, pears, local nuts, etc.  it was really nice.ordered a couple of their wood fired pizzas  mine was the spicy snag homemade sausage, carmelized onions...good stuff!  crust was very good  nice char, leopard spots on the bottom, no flour or cornmeal, and most importantly, very tasty.  sauce was very nice as well.after saving room for dessert and boxing up leftover pizza and salad for lunch for later, we split the banana bread dessert  two pieces of scrumptious banana bread with two small scoops of local berry ice cream  not too big  just the right amount to top off a lovely evening.give this place a go!
it is hard to find great pizza in phx. this pizza was great with tipo oo flour. great crust and dough.the only recommendation is san marzano tomatoes for the sauce. the nutella pizza is epic. just a little different with aussies owning a pizza joint
this place is amazing and so are the owners. pizza is amazing, and fresh. last night was our second time in and the owners remembered exactly what our drinks were from the first time. they make you feel right at home from the minute you walk in. this place will be packed in no time. one of our new faves by far!
quite simply a killer little pizza place. great staff, even if they do have funny accents, great food and a lovely space. the crispy prosciutto salad is tasty with lots of prosciutto and the spicy snag pizza is my favourite with house made sausage and sauteed onions. rumor has it that there is occasionally ghost chili oil behind the bar.
wow! tried this place out last weekwhat a great little place for pizzas and salads! had the base pizza and the sausage pizza with caramelized onions, and the pear and candied walnut salad. very tasty and fresh! they also have a really great cider too.  the owners are super nice aussies.  we will definitely be back. we love supporting our small business owners! go check them out!
the new you gotta try this place !!!  every one of these 5 star reviews say it all.all the pizzas are terrific, even the gf crust option.be sure to try the delish ploughman platter to start with your wine.the wine selection is fab. ross is the sommelier that is super energized at guiding you to your perfect choice for dinner.  all the owners are going to make your visit a pleasure.  just their personality will turn your bad day around.great non alcoholic drinks to choose as well.  ask about the passport coffees and teas.when youre there, say hi to jake in the kitchen formerly of hava java showing off his culinary skills.
we will definitely be back everything is great from the hostess, waiter, even the chef!  the pizzas we are having are absolutely delicious, finally we found our pizza place!!!
visiting from san diego. this place is a gem. great service all around. menu is fantastic and truly organic. we had a chook pizza and by far one of the best pizzas we had in a long time. big plus is that they allow pets on the patio. highly recommend this place you wont be disappointed.
absolutely spectacular. if the food wasnt great enough, the ownership of this establishment is second to none. they greet every person who walks through the door and strives to make a person connection with them all. roscoe is a gem and i cant wait until everyone in phoenix experiences this place. we will definitely be back... soon
very friendly staff, locally owned and all organic ingredients. everything was very fresh and tasty.
excellent casual meal. special pizzas and salads. delicious with very friendly wait staff. try the samuel smith beer from the uk  its great!
my wife and i had an amazing experience here. the food was wonderful and the hosts were very welcoming and fun.  everything we are was incredible.  the smokey hummus is the best i have had. its is hard to believe there still exist places with great food and sensible prices.  i hope to return here next time i am in town.
lovely lunch..organic local ingredients. . great service.. beet salad divine. .but the person service we received was above and beyond come try this new place ... you wont be sorry..
great new pizza joint! friendly owners! the dips are made daily and have tasted fresh and health both times weve had it! for beer i was happy with the sam smiths lager, and i believe they rotate a little! any pizza will do in the wood fired oven!
ahhhhhhhmazing pizzas!! love their rotating dips as well. everything weve had here has been wonderful!! owners are super nice! if you appreciate australia, youll be happy to see some coopers beer on the menu.....but they are very gracious and engaging....cant say enough about how great base and the staff are!! new local hangout!! :
thanks to all you yelpers for writing about base! after reading the reviews we had to check it out and were so glad we did. weve been there for lunch and dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the staff.their take on pizza is different than what i am accustomed to, but quite good.   we particularly like the chook pizza.the ploughman appetizer is extremely good, plenty to share with the table.the servicestaff are, as others have written, like longtime friends. it just feels great walking in to this place and be greeted so warmly. the other night waiting for take out, we noticed they had pimms behind the bar, so we had to try a pimms cup. absolutely wonderful, refreshing on a hot evening. the owners and staff make you hope they will be a success. the quality of the restaurant and food give you confidence they will. as one other reviewer wrote, they really do seem to be hitting on all cylinders.
we enjoyed the friendly service, unique wine choices from owners home country of australia!, and lovely organic, fresh, ingredients on their bruschetta tender and yet crispy bread with tons of toppings!, summer salad, and el diablo and base pizzas.  since its just down the road from our house we feel like its going to a friends place for a casual and cool bite to eat.  well definitely be back.
love this new pizza place! the owners are beyond fabulousso friendly and upbeat! they were great with our kidshad us all laughing and having a great time!the food was fantastic! i love how all of their ingredients are organic! everything was so fresh tasting! i highly recommend the crispy prosciutto salad and the mushroom truffle pizza! both were off the charts good! my son got the shrimp pizza and he said it was the best shrimp he has ever had! and let me tell youhe loves shrimp, so that is a compliment! i have been telling everyone about this wonderful new place! so in love!
they have the prisoner by the glass. need i say more?! great pizza, love the hummus. the owners are funny aussies. were definitely adding this restaurant to our neighborhood rotation.
incredible pizza. ultra friendly service. a warm, inviting environment. if you only read that far, it pretty much covers my experience at base. we stopped in on a busy friday night but were greeted promptly and with gusto from one of the owners who was also our server. we started out with the flatbread and house made dips. the two dips were perfectly portioned for the 8 slices of flatbread. im not sure what they were...besides really tasty. the owner was incredibly busy, but i have no doubt he would have answered any questions that we had about the dish. were just love trying new things, so we just went with it!the wines were written on a chalkboard on the wall. it seemed like they had a good selection, with glasses starting at 5. but we both prefer beer, so we ordered a few glasses. they were nice and cold, if slightly smaller than i would have liked for 6 a piece.we chose the el diablo to share. the pizza itself was a thing of beauty. a wood fired pizza can be a disaster if done incorrectly, but they certainly know what theyre doing. the crust was crispy but not overly so, and spotted but not burnt. all of the ingredients were of the highest quality, which reflected in the incredible flavors. the tomato sauce was simple and fresh.  it was topped with soppressata, kalamata olives, and peppers. it was slightly spicy but might be more intense for those who arent acclimated to spicy dishes.it was a little more than i spend on an average friday pizza night, but the quality is so good that i can see myself coming back for sure. plus, tuesday nights they have half price pizzas. in other words, i think ive found a new night to go out for pizza!
stopped by after visiting a business next door and was stoked with the meal. great people. great service.  excellent pizza! support this small family owned business as now that we have found it we dont want it going anywhere.
stopped here for a late lunch on a saturday. great organic food and great service. i had the pear and rocket salad i added organic chicken. it was amazing! add an ice cold green tea infused with tropical flavors and you have the perfect lunch for the hot arizona summer. i definitely will be back! we need more restaurants like this in the phoenix area!
wow, such great pizza!! rivals cibo and pizzeria bianco. had the base and the diablo, both were fantastic. also had the prosciutto salad which was great the prosciutto was slightly crispy and tasted wonderful. super friendly owners. highly recommend!!
my wife and i stopped here hoping for excellent pizza and were certainly not disappointed. we had the caprese appetizer, a mediterranean pizza, a couple of beers, and closed it out with an espresso ice cream dessert. everything was great, clean, and about as healthy as im comfortable with when it comes to pizza and beer!
this is a great pizza place. organic and local  ingredients with wonderful owners who make you feel at home. so far we have really enjoyed all the pizzas we have tried. the guten free pizza our daughter loved. the owners really understand customer service. we also enjoyed the wine list. we will back for happy hour.
incredible service, amazing owners and even better food. the wood fired pizza experience is one that you have to try... and the base takes it to a new level with organic ingredients and creations that you have never seen but have to try enter the chook pizza. you wont be disappointed.
the service is exceptional, the food and wine are delicious, it is a musttry.
nothing but good things to say about the owners and their wonderful creations! my family and i came here for a late dinner and spent about 2 hours relaxing, drinking wine, and enjoying delicious pizza.
can you say awesome!!! what a wonderful place ! awesome people make you feel like your part of the family! the food is amazing had the base pizza wonderful the salad and also the sauces for dipping great !!!!! we love this place.
aussie owners?! yessss it is. her name is carly, her, her husband and her brother open the base for 3 months now. shes super cute. geez her accent, her energy is great and super friendly!the restaurant has such a good vibe to it. nice patio and great layout.i absolutely love this place. holy cow my mushroom truffle pizza was amazing. especially with the ghost oil sauce. i took off the lid to taste the chili. two thumbs up! i shall be back :d
we came in at 9pm and were given superb service. we were worried about being rushed out but the owners let us take our time ordering and eating your meal. we ordered the meaty one pizza and the crispy prosciutto salad and they were both delicious. the houseinfused olive oils complemented our food well too. aside from the food, the warm hospitality and kindness of the aussie owners were the highlight for us. their recommendations were spot on and they were a pleasure to chat with! they are well travelled and we had a great time exchanging travel tips with each other.
organic fresh pizza, good wine, excellent service!  quiet atmosphere.  plus 12 off pizza after 3 on tuesdays!  pizza is similar to pomo but organic and less expensive.  excellent place.  we really enjoyed our meal and are sharing this with friends
so i just had gluten free pizza for myself and my fam had reg pizza. seriously so good. one thing all gluten free people know: gluten free pizza sucks. this destroys that idea completely. i would eat this as often as possible if i lived in the city visiting. i had the el diablo obvi loved it. my fam had the marg. and an el diablo with regular crust and downed it all. happy all around. cant wait to come back. other perk? the owners are amazing! i wanted to be friends with these people. so personable. so nice. so funny. love them. they care so much about the food theyre putting out, the customers, and the space. this place is awesome.
my husband and i were visiting phoenix when we discovered this place for a quick bite to eat after our midmorning hike. i was a bit skeptical of strip mall pizza, but after seeing the reviews and hearing my stomach, we decided to give it a shot.we split the dipsflatbread as well as the piggy pizza. dips included a hummus and a baba ganoush. pizza was european style with arugula leaves, cheese and prosciutto  added after it was cooked. it was the perfect amount of food to split for a late lunch and everything was delish. my husband loved the hot pepper infused olive oils, especially the ghost pepper hes been inspired to infuse his own at home!even better than the food was the service and the atmosphere. while we sat out on the patio the staff was attentive and engaging to all of the customers, of which many i could tell were regulars they recognized by name. we will definitely return the next time we are in phoenix!
such a great new restaurant! the food was amazing!! so fresh and all organic. they even have organic wine.
amazing! perfect evening. the owner and the staff are incredible and the pizza is perfection. seriously. thank you!!
wow where do i start?! first we ordered the spicy snag with pepperoni and it was amazing. everything was fresh and flavorful. the sausage was very good, the pepperoni wasnt your usual pep it was large and  perfectly cooked, and the carmalized onions had great moisture. the crust was soft but a little crunchy. after all of that we had fresh strawberry reduction sauce over organic vanilla ice cream. the sauce made it. it was very refreshing and satisfying. the best part of it was the service. this is a family owned restaurant. the owners are a couple and a brother. they are very kind and generous. they let us try their homemade olive oilsghost and carolina reaper. overall this was a great restaurant with great food and service.
very pleased to have this new spot in the neighborhood. the menu is full of delicious looking options to both eat and drink. i have done takeout twice and was very pleased on both occasions with both the service and the food. the base what i know to be a margarita pizza has been my favorite thus far. the owners are super attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. thanks for coming to the area!
all i can say is yummmmmm!! base was recommend to us by a friend and it did not disappoint!! the staff was very friendly and the food was wonderful we had the dirty shrimp appetizer delicious, personally i like my shrimp a little less done but this was so tasty it was worth it. the pizza was perfection we had the meaty one it was just the right amount of sauce and toppings. they have a lovely wine list as well as several beers to choose from. my only complaint is that we dont have one on our side of town. enjoy!!
we were so excited to try out this new pizzeria after we saw the initial reviews were so amazing!  we stopped in one night with our dog and ate on the patio.  one of the owners was our server and he was so endearing and really guided us with our choices.  we shared a pear and rocket salad and the prawn pizza with housemade jalapeno oil  wow, that was so good!  we will definitely be back and try some additional pizzas and maybe some dessert next time.
awesome, awesome food and wine by the glass menu. thin crust pizza w local ingredients, we will return.
i loved the service that the give you over there the pizza are taste amazing every thing fresh i loved it.
hidden gem!  i have driven by so many times because i thought the signage was still for the previous restaurant  cafe daniel  just a miserable place.  noticed the new singe above the doors and checked it out.  delicious and creative.   i would highly recommend this place to anyone.  to top the food, the service was outstanding!   they treat you like family and meet all expectations! well done! these aussies have produced a winnercheers
omgsooo good!!! we had a party of seven and we had a great time and great service!!! food was on point tho! great ambiance to straight chillin with da homies. our server, raul, was great! always attentive and super motivational. legit pizza and apps.
this place is flat out wonderful. it had everything a great pizza place needs: a good ambiance, great appetizers, exceptional service, and of course amazing pizza. coming in, the staff was very inviting and helped us to a table right away. the aussie charm, wit, and humor along with being prompt on any order we placed was a combination for incredible service. the waiter was very conversational but in the good way where its important to connect with patrons without annoying them. had the meat and cheese board for a starter and everything on it was extremely delicious. it came with a few pieces of this bread that had a great crunch and melted in my mouth. it was incredible. the pizzas are personal size and thin crust, which i prefer. the roni was incredible, some of the best tasting pepperoni ive ever had. the sauce isnt heavy and very creamy which i really enjoyed and im not a huge pizzared sauce fan. crust was nice and crunchy with a small char on it, and still soft on the inside and to me that is the perfect crust. these aussies really know how to run a good pizza joint, and i will be certainly coming back.
very friendly owners. they made it a very pleasant experience that matched the food quality. nearly everything is organic and we enjoyed everything. we split a salad, corn chowder, pizza, desert and coffee. we did not arrive until 30 minutes before closing and i only realized after we left that it was 30 minutes past closing time. they did not rush us at all. we will be back when we are in the area.
great service even on xmas eve! and great pizza! beet bruschetta, spicy snag and roni ... all outstanding.
it is a nice new facility that recently opened. i called and made an appointment the same day. it is possible that since they do not have a large client base explains why the wait time is unnecessarily long. the staff is as friendly as can be and the expenses are reasonable for an animal hospital. it was 10 per shot and 22 for the fecal test.  i will make them my vet and i look forward to when the office is not so much like a regular doctors office when it comes to wait time. they do take walkins as well, but i could only imagine how long that would take!
great office!  friendly staff, dr bivens  is excellent!  i never leave my english bulldog anywhere!  they had him for 2 hours, all his vaccinations, and spa day my dog walk out looking like a boss!  a special thanks to dr crow for a great referral!
this is a wonderful place to take your pets.  dr. bivens is one of the smartest vets in town and great with animals. it is a beautiful office with a professional staff. i highly recommend this vet!  i have been taking my animals to dr. bivens for the last year and a half and now i have followed him to his new location.
i can honestly say that i have never had as great of an experience at an animal hospital or any doctors office for that matter as i did today with dr. bivens. my dog had a double ear infection and dr. bivens explained every step and detail of what was going on with him as well as what we needed to do to solve the problem and get him back to being healthy! this isnt a doctorcomesinonceandthenyouneverseethemagain type of place! the staff and doctor went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and help heal our furry family member.
after getting a i dont know from our long time vet  we stopped in to see dr. bivenshis first reaction was to do blood work to see what was going on internally,  seemed like a logical reaction and next step  we were able to get a diagnosis and we on the road to recovery  thank you dr. bivens for taking the extra time to show some love to our four legged baby.the office and staff are great  we are looking forward to working with the south buffalo springs team from now on.
south buffalo springs animal hospital recently opened and our dog need her vaccines updated so we thought we would try them out.  dr. bivens and his staff are fabulous!  the wait time is almost nonexistent but that could be because they just opened.  dr. bivens explains everything in detail.  he even took the time to let my daughter to listen to her doggies heartbeat with his stethoscope.  she was thrilled!  we inquired about boarding services and dr. bivens himself gave us the tour of the boarding area.  its clear that he really cares about what hes doing.  the front office staff are also very friendly.  we have definitely found our vet and will continue going back.
this facility just opened about a month ago. we were in the market for a new vet and we decided to check this place out and set an appointment. the interior smelled fresh and the front staff were friendly.  we were pleasantly surprised that they were able to accommodate for one of our dogs that same day. dr bivens examined our dog and explained to us what he was doing and gave his recommendations with an explanation why they were needed after his examination. we did not feel pressured to take any of his recommendations but we did because they were needed and the cost for them were very reasonable. a few  days later, we came back to have our second dob examined and we had the same great experience. it looks like we found our new vet.
went here today with houston, my chocolate lab, to get his ear checked out. dr. bivens and his staff were very professional and easy to get along with. i felt like my dog was in great hands, and will definitely be going back.  i am very happy with the service and care that was provided. the facility itself is brand new. it is very clean and modern, and still comfortable at the same time.
this review is for the boarding services. after the excellent experience we had with boarding, i plan to make this my cats new vet!i left my cat here to board for a few days, and he liked it so much he didnt want to leave! we had a hard time getting him out of the kennel and in to his carrier. they have a separate dog and cat entrance, and the cat kennels look out in to the lobby, so the cats always see people around, instead of sitting alone in some back room. very nice facility, very nice staff. i go out of town every month, and i have finally found a place that my cat seems happy to go to. yay!rates were very reasonable! 5 paws!!
the things i loved most about this place is that is convenient, clean,  has a friendly staff. i couldnt be more happier with the way dr. bivens treated my dog!
our dog was recently lost.  fortunately for us, some one found her and brought her here.  once there, they cared for her and even provided her picture to their existing clients.  because of this, we were reunited with our dog when someone recognized the dog in the picture and contacted us.  thank you south buffalo springs animal hospital for going the extra mile for our family!
i followed dr bivens across the valley from his old veterinarian practice. he is the best in the business hands down and the nicest person youll ever meet. my dog means the world to me and i know that he feels the same way about each pet he treats.  this practice is a stunning facility stateoftheart sure!
dr. bivens is amazing! so wonderful with our puppies, and he takes the time to explain everything. the staff is so helpful and friendly, and he hospital is so nice and clean!
i recently adopted on an eight year old shih tzu from a family with some financial hardships that was very neglected. his teeth were so rotten that his panting could clear out a room. i was planning on calling around looking for the best vet in my area but after dr. bivens took time to actually speak to me on the phone i knew that this was the one. my poor pepper needed a lot of work and dr. bivens really worked with us and was even able to do the extensive dental work that  same day since we didnt want him to suffer anymore. i called and checked to make sure the blood work came back okay and again dr. bivens took the time to talk to me. they were very busy and even had to work after hours to finish up my pup. tldr: a great vet with friendly, knowledgeable staff that you know really care about your pets!
my german shepard was hit by a car last night on buffalo, this place just so happens to be up the street from our house, and open sunday! dr. bivens and his staff were absolutely amazing and took such good care of our guy!  we recently moved to the area and i am so thankful that this animal hospital was nearby!  he will be taking care of our animals from here on out! from the initial call to them this morning, brittain was so sweet and helpful, to the tech checking in on us in the room, to the amazing staff that cared for our dog, they made what was a very stressful, emotional experience into a situation where we felt very comfortable and optimistic. highly recommend this clinic! if you are new to the area, or looking for a new place to take care of your animals, check them out! the facility was incredible and they offer boarding!!
we brought my 13 year old dog to them with an ear issue. they were so fair with their rates and did not try and sell me services my dog did not need. i had taken the same dog to another vet in town a month earlier and the list of things they said she needed was unreal. so many vets give a bad name to the practice for that reason. it is so good to know there is a vet out there whos main concern is the animals. i will strongly recommend this clinic to all my friends.
this is my very first ever review on yelp. im always looking at the reviews to make a decision. so this is pretty important to me. i took my puppy to dr bivens today. what a great doctor! he answered all my questions, and even talked me out of something i wanted to have done, but couldnt because my puppy was to young. he explained why, which tells me he cares! thats all i want is someone that feels the same as i do about animals. oh and another perk....his prices are great!
i have taken my dog to four different veterinarians because of allergies. so far dr. bevins has been the most caring about abbies allergies. she was scratching her front legs till they were blood raw. thank goodness i found dr. bevins. he has been so helpful in clearing up her skin. i was going to see dr. roche and he was also very good. but dr. bevins office is very close to my house. the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. and dr. bevins is extremely knowledgeable. they office is extremely clean, and it smells very good. after five different vets in the las vegas area, i think i have found the vet i will be sticking with from here on out. thank you dr. bevins and thank you for your staff.i will be seeing you soon.shirley childs
dr. bivens is excellent!! i wouldnt trust my pets care to anyone else!! hes very thorough and always meets my expectations. i use to see him at another office, near my home, but i dont mind now traveling an hour, round trip, just to see him....thats how wonderful he is!! if you want your pets to recieve superior treatment, go see dr. bivens!!!! :
i brought my pit bull domino to be seen here for the first time. i wanted a second opinion on her current allergy problem. she has been experiencing allergies since she was 8 weeks old. i have been taking her to maryland  pebble animal hospital since she was 6 months. well, when my dog started her allergy problem they kept recommending anti biotic  anti itch medication w no result. my dog has continued to brake out into skin bumps, bald spots  she is very uncomfortable. she was being seen quite often for skin check ups w no results or any type of relief. finally, i decided to try a new vet. i yelped vets near my location  found this vet hospital w great ratings  reviews. i decided to make an appointment for domino  boy was the experience wonderful. dr. bivens took the time to explain what type of allergies domino might be having, he advised me to change her food,  to not feed her anything other than the medicated dog food. he also prescribed some medication for her that she has been responding to greatly. dr. bivens also advised that we need to do blood work on domino to get to the bottom of her allergy problem. in a few weeks i will have blood work done as it is 400  right now im unable to do so. over all my experience at this location was amazing. dr. bivens amazing. staff amazing. the only thing, this place is a bit more expensive than what i had been paying  maryland  pebble animal hospital but nothing is too expensive for my dogs health  comfort. i will continue to bring my dogs to this location. thank u staff  dr. bivens for the wonderful care you showed my dog  all the insight that i never got from the other animal hospital.
super professional staff! they take great care of my dogs. veterinarians are very knowledgeable. im an owner of a pet sitting service here in las vegas. i have recommended west buffalo springs animal hospital to some of my clients. they have had great experiences as well.
we brought our brand new kitties in for their first set of shots....greeted by friendly staff, super clean facility, and well decorated office! dr bivens is awesome...very attentive and so patient to answer every question we had! big thank you to the staff britain, azalea,  dr bivens! we will continue to come here! also.....affordable prices!!!
this place is great! dr. bivens and his staff were helpful, friendly, and took wonderful care of my puppy. the doc was very thorough with his exam and explained a lot of things for me and cleared up several of my concerns. he was great with my furry child and treated him like his own. the office staff was awesome as well. they answered my questions and gave excellent customer service. the facility is super clean. the place is brand new and is really warm and inviting. their prices are comparable to other vet offices, but their service is way above average. they have followed up with me a couple of times since my visit to make sure i was satisfied. i will be recommending them to my friends and family as i have found my pups new doc. they do boarding too and i will be using them for my boy the next time i need to go out of town.
my little man aka 8 year old silver tabby cat had a great annual check up with dr. bivens at the south buffalo springs animal hospital; which should say a lot to anyone who has ever taken a cat to the vet. at the time of the check up, kitty received his vaccines and a general check up. we were sent home with a stool sample kit. i was very impressed with dr. bivens bedside manner and knowledge. he took the time to get to know our home situation and made great recommendations to improve both mine and kittys cohabitation. front of house staff was friendly and attentive as well.
while visiting montreal, i came across bonanza. nice and cozy spot. the guys who work there are very friendly. awesome service! the sloppy joes are amazing. i recommend fat bastard. i will definitely return again!
little hole in the wall with an excellent selection of sloppy joes , and subs . honestly one of the best ive had in a very long time , fresh bread and amazing sauce . will definitely be coming back !
i didnt think much of this place when i first walked by but once i glanced over at the chalkboard i figured id try at least their what im assuming is their flagship sloppy joe.  best one ive had  ever. and ive had some in philly. perfect amount of spice. almost sloppy enough for leftovers. bonus: its 5 bucks. the 2nd time i went i got the what i thought was going to be a girly type of pesto submarine for my wife but ended up eating most of it. part of me wants to keep this place to myself but that would be wrong on many levels, hence this review. i get cravings for this place.
after seeing constant numerous checkins from fellow yelp friends i needed to know what all this chaos was about. the other day i convinced my mom to go out to lunch with me to viva las arepas next door so i could be sneaky and finally have my chance to try out art of flavors. when i got there, it was around 11am but they did not open until 1pm. i went next door for my planned lunch with mom and tried eating as slow as i could; i had to tell her my sneaky unaccomplished surprise plan to go next door for some of this hear say amazing gelato. we ended up having to leave but i was not going to drive all the way back to henderson with out my gelato! right after walking in the place, it was packed with customers in a matter of seconds. the owner desyree alberganti introduced herself and gave us a brief introduction of her gelatos. she makes them on site, with all fresh and natural ingredients, she is a true master and artisan at developing new bold delicious flavors. she develops and features a different flavor every day and features them as her flavor of the day specials or as in italian you would say sapore del giorno. these are flavors you would never even image or even think they could possibly be as yummy as they actually are. pears and gorgonzola, rosemary and eov extra olive oil, kidney beans...an italian twist of i guess hmong bean icecream...and of course flavors like strawberries and cream, white coffee bean, almond brittle and many others.i tried a single scoop of the pears and gorgonzola and mom had two flavors, almond brittle and strawberries and cream. all three flavors were phenomenal! i was surprised to also see people coming in to pick up special orders and multiple tubs of her awesome gelato, its that good! before leaving i asked her about gelato cakes and she was very eager to answer any questions, she handed me her card to email her. i cant wait for art of flavors to have their own personal website up and running. this place is a true gem of downtown lv. congratulazioni per i gelati incredibili. buona fortuna per la vostra impresa bussiness.
simply amazing gelato with a lot of unique flavors to choose from....basil, rosemary, sweet corn, and cinnamon sticky buns to name a few.  the service is amazing and the owner explained the flavors and ingredients she used in each one we sampled.  the gelato is smooth, light and creamy with their distinctive flavors. this is a must when your in the downtown las vegas area. parking is small but its worth it!
came in and the owner, desyree, immediately greeted my cousin and i. she was more than helpful, kind, and proceeded to let us try every flavor they had available today. exceptional customer service!desyree is always concocting new flavors to share for the public, some being mac  cheese, cream cheese  salmon, and chicken wings. she uses no preservatives or artificial flavors whatsoever, and she proved to me that she doesnt need any to make some of the best gelato ive ever had.after trying nearly every flavor, my cousin decided on the spearmint which had real candy cane bits in it and white coffee bean and i got pistachio and the flavor of the day, warm apple pie with real apple pie inside it!. the flavors really tasted like what they were supposed to taste and the gelato itself was creamy and thick.i would definitely recommend this place. i dont care if its the middle of december, im going back asap! it is definitely the best gelato in the country!
i dont know if this is the same owners as before but art of flavors is definitely not closed. i asked why they closed for a few months and the server quickly said she did not know and then moved on to another subject, so not sure there. i was looking at previous photos here on yelp because we never had the chance to go before it closed for a few months, and the gelato photos do look slightly different than what we saw tonight. but it was really darn good and the server was really nice and even let us try a tiramisu cup and macchiato on the house.  let me tell you the tiramisu was legit and really good.  i had the mint chocolate chip and pistachio flavors.  both were delicious and tasted real and not artificial crap ingredients.  weve been missing luvit when it was under the original owners so this is a nice surprise to find it open. definitely recommend even if it is not the same owner!
gelato!!!so sad when yelp said they closed before i got to try it. happy to see it was open when i came to get arepas to go next door. the owner said they are slowly reopening and do not have everything on the menu they did before yet. like any other gelato location, they have a ton of flavors. felix, the owner, let us try a bunch of flavors and while we were munching, the would walk out with freshly made samples for us to try. 1 scoop w waffle cone  2.99  1  the two flavors that got me were, pistachio and macadamia nut. not to sweet and love the nut bits you get with each bite. very creamy and soft gelato. felix turned my 1 scoop into a 3 scooper!capuchino  2.99  very good and was not super strong. felix even gave us a free biscotti to eat with it. felix was amazing. so nice and friendly. i hope he can bring art of flavors back to its glory!
literally the best ice cream ive had in the usa, and its managed to actually get better since my last visit.the first time we went here, was january, and i found the fairly odd flavor selection like hummus, cheese puff, and beyond interesting, and the ice cream was really good.since my recent visit in late june, art of flavors apparently under new management has scrapped the bizarre flavors and gone more traditional, with a few interesting but delightful combinations like pear  blue cheese. i ordered the coconut ice cream, and it was absolutely the best ice cream ive had in the usa ill admit ive had better in spain and in italy...but..cmon!. authentic, creamy, not too sweet, loads of coconut without being too chunky. this place is small, independent, and in a funky small strip mall youd expect to find in a rough part of the vegas strip. the gelato is far better than anything youll get at belagio or anywhere else, but if youre going for glamour or atmosphere, look else where.
this place is a hidden gem, im originally from san diego which has chacolat, the best gelato place outside of italy and this place reminds me of that. their pistachio gelato tastes like real pistachios and not that fake pistachio flavor that other gelato and ice cream parlors have. ive tried all the gelato that vegas has to offer and nothing compares. try it once and youll be back, i guarantee it.
it never disappoints. the flavors are excellent and the staff is so friendly. worth the drive to come here. blows casino ice cream and gelato out of the water.
the banana gelato was the best gelato ive ever had including in italy. the chocolates seemed pricey. the woman working was very nice and helpful.
this place is amazing, the gelato has a smooth creamy consistency and the flavors were spot on delicious, the decor is very unique and the staff is as sweet as their gelato. i would come here everyday if i lived in town. this place is a must try, dont let all the bad reviews fool you, this place is hands down the best gelato ive had in a long time
please disregard pam rudolph and bruce rudolph review!! if you yelp them...you will see they are deceptive and dishonest. many people have been victims of their unhappy, rude, dishonest complaints!!!
thanks terri for all you do in making my hair look great!  as you know i travel so much and at times ive tried other people when it came down to my schedule with not such great results.  thanks for fixing all of my mistakes along the way. you are by far...simply the best in your field!!gosh...how many years have you been doing my hair??people think im much younger than i am ;  thank you!see you soon,jeannine
who  great service  the help me set up my nevada corporation in just a few days..  couldnt have gone any smoother and i knew nothing on how to do this process
i am extremely happy with the professional services incparadise provides. we have been with them since 2012. they are prompt to respond to email and phone calls. they have never failed us when time comes up to renew. once, while sitting in a nevada bank account reps office, i was able to make a quick phone call to incparadise to get the information the bank needed.  this is important because banks want to know that you have an actual virtual office for your business address. making that phone call in front of the bank rep proved that our office address is at a virtual office with virtual office support. nancy m.del mar, california
exemplary tacos.  they are tiny but tasty. thats ok, i can always head to natys for a largeandincharge al pastor! in a world plagued by uninspired veggie tacos, even the veggie taco was terrific. the truck and trailer are also a sight to behold.   when does the brick and mortar place open up? im there.
i got their amazing sweet potato soft tacos from the food truck. i knew that with every bite i was closer to being done, but they tasted so good that i couldnt stop eating them. my only gripe is that the soft tacos were so small, but it wasnt enough of a problem for me to knock off a star.
i was driving out for lunch when a new sign caught my eye. souvlaki vieux grec just opened its doors and is trying to make a name for itself in an area well known for similar greek restaurants. oddly enough, the cover of their menu looked familiar and after some inquiry its the same owner of le village grec.my coworker and i opted in sitting in and ordered away. i went with a gyro pita with fries and soda and my coworker took a souvlaki stick platter. its not fine dining with plastic plates and utensils in a rather small seatin area but lets be honest, they seem to they truly focus on takeoutdelivery and i saw them in action! this is great for me, particularly during the cold winter months.so how was the food? the gyro pita was very tasty and the plate of fries was my favorite, thick and long, hard on the outside and chewy on the inside. my coworker let me taste a piece of the souvlaki pita and it was the real deal folks. all in all, this grub brings serious competition and i hope it establishes its own clientele in the area so that it lasts.the pricetag is good and the service was solid.i think this is a start to a long and happy relationship.

i rarely rate places on yelp unless they are extremely terrible or extremely amazing, and bowties bridal outlet was amazing!  i am so beyond pleased with my experience there, i want to share and give them props.  my fiance and i are having a short engagement of less than 3 months.  when i went to look for a dress at alfred angelo i was told there was not enough time to order a dress and i would have to buy one off the rack.  i found bowties bridal outlet, where they sell only floor sample gowns.  and i must say after going to a few stores, the quality of these dresses is by far way better than davids or alfred angelo at a fraction of the price!  they sell all designer gowns at crazy discount prices.  they have so many gorgeous gowns in all sizes.  i went in and was helped by kelly and i want to say kathy and was so happy with their positive personalities and helpful tips and suggestions.  they also do not pressure you into buying a dress, like davids and angelo.  i wasnt sure about a dress on day one, so they told me they would look in the back and pull other dresses in my size they thought would look nice on me.  i came back the second day and they really had pulled the perfect gown for me!  this dress is a european, fashion forward dress that cost 1795 regular price, that i paid 429 for!  i thought while im here and getting such amazing service i am getting my veil as well!  we tried on several and decided on a chantilly lace veil that would have cost more than the dress for 149.  they even gave me suggestions for alterations and called to see when an appointment would be available for me.  when i had the dress on kelly asked me are you saying yes to the dress?  i was so happy!  they really make you feel special!  i had only one person to shop with me, but it felt like 3 with these 2 amazing staff members.  i even suggested to my friends in wisconsin if anyone is getting married, it is worth the plane ride to las vegas to shop here!  so amazing.  i cant say enough great things.  if you are getting married, go here before you commit to a high priced gown elsewhere!  thank you guys!  p.s. they even told me to come back after my wedding and give them a picture to get blown up and put on their wall.  i cant wait:
so im getting married in june of next year so my mom, aunt and i decided to start dress shopping while in town. i honestly just wanted to get an idea of what would compliment my figure best and what styles i wanted to start considering. kathy gave me all the attention and helped us through the whole process with just a phone call heads up 30 minutes prior. she had great insight and made me feel like a princess!! loved her honesty and attention to detail. she has a great loveable personality that made this process so much smoother than i had anticipated. anyway, without thinking it would be possibility, i found the dress!! due to the fact that its an outlet i saved over 1000 off retail price. if you were to see the dress youd understand what a bargain it is considering the crystal and lace detailing. beyond amazing feeling to find the dress and be filled with overwhelming happiness. i cant wait to marry my fiance and see his face as i walk down the aisle.thank you so so much kathy and bowties bridal outlet!! definitely worth the trip. their dress selections are amazing!!!
i went in looking for an offtherack dress, as my wedding is in two months.  they have a decent selection of nice gowns at discounted outlet prices.  kathy is the primary reason, though, why i give this shop 5 stars.  she was so awesome friendly, helpful, and an allaround fun and great person to talk with!  though i did not end up buying my dress here, i would still recommend this store.
i cant say enough good about this place! after having an awful experience at davids bridal i looked up bridal dress shops and this one popped up with good reviews. i went in on a saturday and scheduled an appointment for the next tuesday. ivanna wasnt there when we got there cuz of a computer error on my appointment but she drove from the other side of town to come help me. we tried on a few dresses without her and when she came in she laced me up into 2 dresses and the 2nd one ended up being the dress! at the other salons i never got that feeling and the consultant at davids told me i might not get that feeling and that not everyone was a crier. i am a crier i cried when my sister got her dress last year and i cried when i put on my dress. thank you for pulling the perfect dress and giving me an amazing experience! if you are even considering going here please do! you wont regret it!! and my dress was a 1300 dress for 429!!! what a steal!
i have to admit, when i first walked into this store, i was a little hesitant because wasnt lush and fancy as other bridal salons. that meant nothing to the quality of this place. my sister is the bride, and we had looked at about 4 other salons and havent found anything close to being the one. she wanted a satin gown with a lace bodice, and every consultant said that wasnt possible. but lo and behold, we found a dress with exactly that, in her size and without any flaws. so perfect! and the price: 429 for 1300 originally! you cant beat that! we havent had any alterations yet, so i cant comment on those, but the seamstress was very knowledgable and reasonably priced, so i have high hopes. give this salon a try! the only negative i have to say, is that this is an offtherack salon, so make sure you check for flaws and imperfections.
i recently resumed my practice formerly practiced at the wonderful but now closed, grateful yogi and am so fortunate to have found this beautiful and intimate studio in their new main street location. i have very recently taken three classes  and found each one to be extremely rewarding. while each experience was different, all the teachers with whom ive practiced have been warm, welcoming and devoted.whether youre visiting lucky tourist special or local, this studio is a gem set amidst the burgeoning las vegas arts district.
i took my teacher training at this studio and immediately fell in love with the practice. the training was lifechanging and allowed me to see that yoga is so much more than just a physical practice. it helped me understand yogas holistic method to health. angelica, the owner of the studio, strives to provide her best to make her clients feel at home with the studio and does a fantastic job at it. whether youre an advance practitioner or a beginner, sin city yoga is a studio that provides a practice with versatility, style,  fun! also, angelica has a great intro offer for new clients  40 for 30 days of unlimited yoga, so if you take one class per week thats only 10class. definitely a bang for your buck! i highly recommend this studio to anyone!!!
great studio, friendly, welcoming and fun atmosphere! a variety of different teachers are sure to make you smile. a beautiful wall mural is a lovely accent to the atmosphere! they have a wide variety of classes and workshops available for any schedule  easy to book online too!
consistently a warm, welcoming, nurturing experience. i cannot say enough complimentary things about this wonderful space in the heart of the arts district.i urge you to experience it, you will call it home!!
when my previous studio closed, i developed a home practice, but i really missed the homey feel of a studio. sin city yoga is a beautiful space to practice! the crowd is friendly, its an awesome downtown location, and there are so many amazing teachers! i especially love power yoga with pam and amber, and todds tuesday class is a great way to start the week! angelica has created a wonderful space for students of all levels. there is a great variety of classes, from power to yin, which i really appreciate. my practice can change with my mood at sin city. i highly recommend checking it out!
ive been going to this studio for about 112 years and had very little yoga experience previously. they are always to welcoming and accommodating to newcomers and beginners. the variety of classes and caliber of teaching has greatly advanced my practice, and they just keep on improving!
my oneyear member anniversary was last week and i have literally never had a bad class at sin city. all of the teachersincluding guests and workshop leadersare open and welcoming. classes, even when packed, are small enough for individual attention and adjustments.if youve been practicing for a while, and are up for a challenge, budokon is amazing, and sin city is the only studio in town where you can try it.
sin city yoga has such a welcoming environment for all levels of yogis. whether its your first time or youve been doing yoga for years, the teachers will guide you through your practice. the classes are all spread out. so if you have a really early schedule or a late one, theres options for you. they also offer fun workshops you can sign up for. theyve had and will have... natural skin care workshop, prenatal yoga, a camping retreat, etc. check them out and see if its a fit for you!
whether you live in las vegas or are just passing through, i would definitely recommend that you take a class or workshop at this studio!  sin city yoga has the kind of local and inviting atmosphere that you may not find at other studios and its located in the las vegas downtown arts district.
the absolute best yoga studio in the city. i have to say, marcy  her morning energy keep me coming back weekly. the monthly membership is well worth the price and you can go to classes whenever you want. just look at the schedule, signup and show up. their new studio is bright and spacious, somewhere you definitely want to be.what i like the most, is that, it doesnt come across as a fitness studio. even though some of the classes are tailored more for a workout, its very much mind and body. they do a lot of outside activities and feel very community building, which i love. try their 1 month trial. its worth the money and youll want to since up as a regular after that.
ive been a member here for over four months now and absolutely love it!  they have such a wide range of instructors that there is a perfect teacher for everyone or for whatever mood youre in.  the teachers are always very welcoming and often ask if theres anything in particular anyone wants to work on  they definitely take into consideration what their members goals are and help them work towards them.  the studio also has extra workshops and events last weekend, there was a camping retreat to learn more about yoga and expand your practice.  its such a warm and friendly place with such a nice balance of fun and serious yoga practicing.  i highly recommend sin city to anyone looking for a studio to join.
great location  fantastic instructors. they are so welcoming  genuinely interested in your wellbeing. love this place!
cannot say enough great things about this studio. i am in town for a convention, and was looking for a yoga studio to take a few classes. im a beginner, and they made me feel completely comfortable and welcome. i ended up paying the introductory 40month, even though i was only in town a few days. each class is about 20, and i knew i would go more than twice. i took bed head yoga with marcy a couple days. wish i couldve stayed after for the meditation session. loved her and the class! it was 45 minutes, and a great way to start the day. also did a flow class with amber. her style is different than marcys, but loved her just as much. i wish i could keep attending the classes! i hope to attend the yin candlelight yoga this evening before my red eye. tip: download the mind body connect app to book and pay for your classestip2: they dont have free mats to use, but you can rent them for 2, or purchase at the location.g
the space is nice and large, very clean and well appointed. i loved the class i took which was resorative yoga. very good, long stretches that i needed. 40 for a month of unlimited classes for new visitors is the deal that got me in and imso happy i went. wonderful yoga teacher. there are a lot of different times and types of classes. main street is really fun these days.
ok ill admit im not a yogi! and ill admit that i met the owner angelica long before i stepped foot in her studio. she just had this uplifting and inspirational ora about her. i was truly taken aback in a good way by the positive energy she carried. i walked in to her studio and i instantly got it....you can see her energy portrayed in the studio and its teachers. located right on main st in downtown, the areas trendy new neighborhood feel is an ideal location. street parking is ample and there a coffee shop right across the st also the velveteen rabbit bar of youre looking for something a bit stronger . i love the studio itself! large glass storefront with a small boutique entrance, massive studio space in the center and the teachers practice slightly different than other studios. no mirrors here which i found different from the 5 other yoga studios ive ever been in. the teachers act as mirrors in a way, they ask if you are comfortable with slight physical modifications to improve the posture that you are in. its a little strange at first to have such a hands on approach but it really helped me deepen stretches and ultimately get more out of my practice. i cant wait to join one of the yoga retreats when i have a little more free time! thanks angelica for creating such a positive space that really helps me destress!

tout ce que jai a dire : enfin un petit endroit chaleureux a lachine ou il fait bon savourer un delicieux cafe!
this is the newest and cleanest goodwill i have ever been to. now open for about two weeks in the centennial hills area.  this location has both the square footage and the inventory to keep you intrigued on the treasures you may find.  i always like to look at the knick knacks, games, electronics, and toys.  you never know what you might find at a place like this.  one mans trash is anothers treasure.  if i were you i would come here often and dont forget to donate to this local organization.
this is probably the cleanest goodwill ever. good location and the store is always organized. prices are good and the staff are friendly.  even when the store is crowded and the line is long, the employees are fast to run up at the front cash registers and help out . they also always have some kind of a discount thing going on to help you save more money. they even sell new items at a reasonable  price. so the prices are great, the deals are good. the employees are friendly. the store is in a nice location and its always organized. and thats why i give this place a 5 star and i would recommend this store to everyone i know.
love this place! we had been to the location in henderson a few times but we live in summerlin and were so excited to see a location opening on our side of town! they have lots of great stuff and prices are reasonable. staff is friendly and helpful. love taking our pup along too!
this store is awesome.  nilla wafer loved all the extra attention she got today.  the prices and selection are fantastic.  so glad they have a location on the west side now.
so happy they opened up a shop on my side of town. i brought myles down to pick up a new collar and a toy. the staff was very friendly as always and came over to meet myles and she helped me to pick out a toy that he would enjoy, that didnt require me throwing!great selection, great prices, great customer service!
we took our newly adopted havanese to desert breeze dog park this weekend and he had a blast. people told us about the dog supplies outlet at sahara near durango so we went to check it out. we liked the variety of products snd the helpful staff. we appreciate having people who know dogs recommend supplies.we need a harness so we have to bring teddy in to be measured.we got an aqua safety jacket for him plus a nyla bone, some hide chews, a portable water carrier and collapsible bowl, plus a ball thrower and a plastic ball which looks great for the swimming pool.isnt it just like having a new baby when you have to start out scoping out furniture and toys!! we are very happy with teddy and look forward to being regulars at this lovely new store!!
so excited they opened a summerlin location! ive been making the trek to the henderson location for a while now, but is location is so much more convenient! everyone that works here is super knowledgable and friendly and they always are willing to help you find what you need. this is my absolutely favorite pet supply store and will never shop anywhere else for my puppys essentials! love this place.
they have a bunch of stuff my dolce picked his own bally that he loved l was kind of late so l have to come back with more time, but the employee was very nice and polite never rushed me or anything and he tooked a pic of my baby.!!!
we took our newly adopted havanese to desert breeze dog park this weekend and he had a blast. people told us about the dog supplies outlet at sahara near durango so we went to check it out. we liked the variety of products snd the helpful staff. we appreciate having people who know dogs recommend supplies.we need a harness so we have to bring teddy in to be measured.we got an aqua safety jacket for him plus a nyla bone, some hide chews, a portable water carrier and collapsible bowl, plus a ball thrower and a plastic ball which looks great for the swimming pool.isnt it just like having a new baby when you have to start out scoping out furniture and toys!! we are very happy with teddy and look forward to being regulars at this lovely new store!!
love this place!! huge selection  great prices! my 2 frenchies niko  tesla already recognize the store when we pull up!! amazing service!  keep up the great job!
we absolutely love this place. they have great prices and selection. we have been there twice now and both times we have experienced great customer service. no reason to ever go back to the big pet stores.
i am so happy that they opened up a location near me. the store is huge and i always want to buy everything for my dogs. i always leave spending more than i should lol. they have a wide selection of about anything you need for your dogs. my first visit i got my two german shepherds a big jolly ball which is now probably one of their favorite toys. the staff is always friendly and helpful. the best part is that you can build points that turn into store credit so all my spendings will be worth it eventually.
discovered this location on facebook, and boy am i glad i did!the selection is impressive  toys, leashes, collars, bowls, beds, training aids  you name it. ive never not been able to find something im looking for.on top of all of that, the prices are amazing. they show you the normal going price at other stores aka petsmart so you can see just how much youre saving. my shiba inu is loving the discount, because her toy stash has doubled. in addition, they carry the higherend, better quality foods. their prices make them comparable to decent quality foods at any of the chain stores. so in addition to having more toys, my dog is also eating better.the staff is super helpful and not in the least bit pushy.even if its a bit of a drive, i highly suggest stopping by the store. no way youll walk out without getting something.
went here with my dog after seeing their facebook ad. great store, good selection of items at a very good price and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. they even take a pic of your dog and put it up on the wall. highly recommend if your looking for anything dog related!
im never going back to petco or petsmart to purchase dog supplies ever again and i love petco.this place is phenomenal! its not as big as i had hoped, but their selection is awesome and their employees are super helpful. we found an amazing soft toy that was recommended by the girl that works there, and its the only soft toy that our dog couldnt rip apart in 5 minutes. the girl made the perfect recommendation, the tuffy toys they carry really are tough!we also bought some treats, and the prices there are super reasonable. depending on the product its almost the same as online pricing, but you dont have to wait for it to get shipped to you!they also have a rewards program that is actually beneficial.... i never know if i get anything out of the petco card, but the one here is simple. get 50 points a point is a dollar, get 4 dollars store credit. i cant count how much that would have saved us at petco.great prices, great employees, and even closer to where we live then petco. i have found a new favorite dog store!
great selection of toys, dog food even raw, crates, beds, collars and leashes! very friendly  helpful staff.  my new go to for dog stuff!its open on sunday!
wow, talk about impressive!  went to this store yesterday for the first time to pick up 2 leashes for molly and elmo.  the people who work here are awesome!  very helpful, very professional.  the selection is great, the prices are great, the whole experience is great.  i will never shop again at a chain pet store.  this is going to be our new place for everything we need for our kids...  hands down, if you have not been here, you really need to visit and check it out.  you will be impressed!
where do i begin!? this store is perfect! every time i see a puppy store i always stop to check it out! and let me say, i did not expect this store to be so amazing!!!!! they have everything you need!! and if they dont, their incredible staff will help you find something equally as amazing if not better!!!! the prices are the cheapest in town!!!! i just want to thank lisa for being sooooo perfect and great!!!!! i came to this store 2 days in a row and she helped me both times! she is really attentive to your needs and will always give you the best advice!!!! if lisas boss is reading this, i demand a raise!!!! i can say that she goes above and beyond her job! every single time! and not to mention, my puppy loves her. and last but not least! they have a rewards program! every dollar you spend is one point per dollar!!!!!!! so not only do they have better prices than any other dog store ive ever been to....they have the reward program that will save me thousands of dollars too!!! they really mean when they say outlet because its the same great stuff you find at petco or petsmart but half the price!!! half the price plus the rewards???!!! if youre going anywhere else for your pets needs youre crazy!!!! its amazing, theyve got me sold for life! soooo happy! 10 stars if i could!!!!!
food, treats, bowls, kennels, leashes, collars, toys and more toys and everything else i missed all in one place. oh yeah, and they are cheaper then the big chain places and have way better rewards programs. if you have a dog, you need to shop here and bring your dog, they are welcome!!
this business had a table set up at desert breeze dog daze of summer.  since i was given a 5 coupon to spend in the store i figured i would check them out.  its definitely set up outlet style with aisles of leashes, toys, treats, bowls, etc.  they even have a room just for dog beds.   i think their prices are very reasonable on a majority of items.  having four dogs myself, besides beds and potty training pads this would be my go to store for most everything else.  the beds and pads just happen to be items i buy at costco.  i like how they have their toys separated as far as puppy to adult and chewing strength.  they carry my brand of dog food here but not the specific variety i need, but i am able to order it and they get it within the week, and the price is comparable to amazon and definitely cheaper then petco.   and if you come in with your pet they will take a picture of them and put it on their wall.  tons of photos are already on display!
james is the best! he is very knowledgable and is very good with his customers! he bends over backwards to help me and my 2 adorable children! he deserves a month paid vacation to bora bora!
lisa, james and everyone that i met from day 1 till now have been nothing but great help for me and my handsome 8 month old french mastiff marmalade i love going in there and seeing all the new toys and excitement. it keeps a smile on my face especially with marmalade being happy to see lisa and everyone there. thank you guys for everything you do.
we just got our first puppy and were told about this place.  i needed a fence for the puppy, and the employees were extremely helpful in finding the right one.  also, they have a great rewards program.  it is a little out of the way from home and work, but i will go back, because the employees were so helpful.
plenty of toys, crates, food, collars, treats, etc. everything is affordable and service is wonderful. they are knowledgable and helpful with all your puppy needs. i will definitely be going back with my little teddy to get his photo placed on the wall.
i love this place. the staff is always helpful and friendly. high end products without the high end price.  great treat selection and toys galore lol.  you also get points to use for your next purchase. come check it out if you are a dog lover like me or any pet for that mattet. happy yelping xoxox
just checked out this nice dog and cat supplies store and really liked it!! they have a variety of dog toys that are reasonably priced and the staff were very friendly. if i lived here, i would come here for my pets needs!!
update: received a very nice phone call apologizing for the lack of communication. they came out and looked at my system. they ascertained that it had been installed improperly by the original company. great guys. very professional. will use again.
had them come out for a plumbing leak from my warranty company . they were true professionals and only took a few minutes to diagnose the issue. this was actually the second plumbing company my warranty company sent out.the first company was unable to help us. would definitely recommend this company and we will use them again with future plumbing problems
jose and his crew are very professional and efficient. they came an hour after i called them on a problem due to a humming sound on my water line. they came and fixed the problem within minutes. its like jose has a magic wand on these things that it just fixes what he touches. i highly recomend them.
i went in for a cleaning and walked out feeling like i had a brand new mouth. best cleaning of my life! the doctor was super friendly and thorough, explaining exactly what he was doing and looking for during the entire examination. when the exam was complete he made a joke that i had a boring mouth since everything looked great. the entire staff was super friendly and im looking forward to going back in 6 months!
this was my first time at smile clinque, i had not been to a dentist in a few years and a friend recommended them to me.  upon walking into the office i was greeted and immediately felt like a valued patron.  staff was more than friendly and i was ushered right back by my hygienist despite the lobby being full of other patients who were also being helped by other smile clinique staff members.  my xrays and cleaning were painless and as enjoyable as going to the dentist can be.  the doctor came over and was very professional but made you feel comfortable like youd known him for years.  i was so impressed with the service i received today that i scheduled a teeth whitening next week!
i went in today for a cleaning, it was my first time going to one of smile cliniques various locations throughout the valley.  from the office manger to the hygienist, to the dentist, everyone was professional and friendly, making me feel like i had been going there for years.  i left with the cleanest and smoothest feeling teeth i have ever had!  the polishing i got during my cleaning was exponentially better than any i have had before, my teeth felt as smooth as glass.  highly recommend smile clinique to anyone looking for fast, friendly, affordable dentistry!  they have offices all over the valley!
i am a new patient of smile clinique and i had a wonderful experience with the dentist and the whole staff. i have referred 3 friends to the practice already and i highly recommend them to anyone needing dental services. they have great new patient incentives and affordable options for dental procedures. try them out, you will be happy you did!!!
the new firehouse subs is open and they have the best subs in town. i have had the steak and cheese 2 times and each time high quality food right temperature and perfectly  cooked
was super excited to find a firehouse subs closer to home. had to give it a try and glad i did. they did not disappoint! i ordered the cheesesteak sandwich no mustard sauce and it was really delicious!!! i will be back for more
ive been here three times since i found out they opened the restaurant. i love the food and the people who work here are very friendly.
ive been eagerly awaiting the opening of a firehouse subs close to home for awhile, and had high expectations, they did not disappoint! the store looked great, and was very clean. the people at firehouse subs are very welcoming,and friendly. the food is amazing, definitely the most delicious sub ive ever had! i ordered the turkey and bacon sub,it was fantastic,the bread was fresh,great turkey,and a really good ranch sauce. definitely worth the drive from anywhere!
walked in firehouse and was greated by every staff member working. ordered my sub and was a quick easy process. got my food in less than 10 minutes this places is amazing and out beats subway!
ordered the hook  ladder light turkey  ham plain and got an order of chili to tryshare. the chili was very good and the sandwich was really good and then i decided to try a spoonful of chili on my sandwich... it was amazing. i may always have to order chili with my subs going forward. that combination just made my day.
have you ever been to a sub joint where the sub they make for you looks just as good or even better than the photo on the menu!? well this place is it! the subs are jam packed with tender meat, fresh veggies and spices. subway cant compete!
service, service, service. seriously every time i have been here everyone has been friendly and quick to greet me. not typical of the fast casual enviroment. food: if you have ever been to a firehouse before you know what they have sandwhiches. from hot to cold to item of the month. i have never had a bad sandwhich from firehouse and this location is no different. always nice. i recommend getting dressings on the side for any with italian i like to control the amount i put on. go check them out. they beat some of the other sandwhich shops close by.
just passing through and stopped at my new favorite sub house, yummy!  great friendly staff, perfect toasted sandwich.  will be back!
we love firehouse subs, and were so glad one finally opened in tolleson!  today was my first time eating in, and i was surprised how big it was inside....other ones ive been in have been much smaller.  i tried one of their new cold heroes and the malibu was very good.  it had a spicy honey mustard dressing on it, that had a horseradish kick and i loved it!  i also tried their sweet tea and it was perfect.  not too sweet at all, like some other places.  just perfect.  the service was great, too.  one worker even brought my mom an extra pickle because he noticed she didnt have one.  its not that they forgot to give her one, she just ate it first when her sandwich arrived!  another worker cleared our trays for us, too.  very friendly!  so glad its only a couple of miles from my house.
never eaten at a firehouse subs.  this is is such a cute chain.  we ordered the hook and ladder, brisket and the meatball.  all 3 were amazing.  best meatball sandwich ever....!!! top it off they have what i call the majic soda machine... if you have never tried it, give it a chance.... you will never think about another sandwich place!
ny steamer and engineer subs are fabulous. good amount of meat and , bread is nice and soft. service is great. very friendly employees. i can always count on them to be consistently good.
i was really impressed with the service, selection and prices at lv sofa factory.  i wanted to buy a reclining sectional for my husbands den for his 50th birthday.  i am a comparison shopper so i looked around for about a month, online, at the large furniture retailers, places like big lots and costco, and found this place close to my home. i found a few sets i loved and was impressed by the quality and the prices.  norman, my salesperson, and john, the owner, were amazing in working with me so that i could arrange for a surprise for my husbands birthday!  the delivery was quick, on time and they put together the set perfectly. our set is beautiful, comfortable and i am so pleased with my experience at lv sofa factory!
i finally bought couches after moving here 3 months ago. ive been looking around online and the las vegas area for couches for my new apartment. out of every store ive gone to lv sofa factory was the most welcoming. scott, my sales person was awesome. he really knew his stuff when he took me from couch to couch. i already had my mind set on a sectional and i picked the one i could see myself lounging around on. the prices here are very affordable compared to other places. my sectional was just delivered and it fits perfectly in my living room. the delivery men were very helpful and polite. i would recommend lv sofa factory for affordable and stylish couchessectionals.
low pressure sales staff answered all my questions and addressed my concerns with professional and informative responses. price was very good and delivered on time with polite and helpful movers. ill recommend them to everyone
only about 60 of the menu has been released so far. im excited to see the rest! food they dont skimp on their portions. i went with one other friend  we ordered the bulgogi jeongol  we had more than enough for a third person. even perfect for a group of 4, if you want to eat a satisfying amount  know that you will get dessert afterwards ; side dishes were all very good too  just wish they had offered about 23 more. service really good  quick. very friendly too! theyre really good about filling up waters, empty side dishes,  such. i cant wait for their dessert bar  grill area to open up!
i went every koreanasian restaurant near u of i and yori q have the best bulgogi on campus. service is very nice and friendly.
best korean food ive had so far in champaign. i thought woorijib was good, but this is even better. i normally dont like eating hotpot, but since they seem to specialize it in, i gave it a try. it was satisfying. the flavors are there with the right amount of spiciness. i would recommend it to anyone who likes korean food. the service was great too. we had the private room at the back. they checked on us consistently.
finally a korean restaurant in town with great food and service. too bad it opened weeks prior to my departure. after trying all the korean restaurants in town, i must say i was used to having to settle for restaurants with positive aspects and mediocre aspects, food wise, service, ambiance, price. tried this place twice before leaving and both times i had a great experience. having lived in los angeles i know the standards for korean restaurants pretty well. this place excelled in all aspects. for being a brand new restaurant the service was very attentive and fast, which is unusual for restaurants with training staff. they made sure we were satisfied with our meal. the ambiance hasnt change much since the last asian restaurant in the location but was given a rather simple but clean facelift. ive tried the spicy chicken stew, naegmyon and other dishes and all of them where very flavourful and generous portions, especially considering other korean restaurants in town. if the service and food quality persist in this restaurant it will definitely be the go to place for everyone in town craving korean food.
definitely recommend this place! great service, great food. id recommend their hot pod and corn pancake. this place just opens and ive already visited three times.
best korean restaurant in champaign urbana hands down. theyve raised the prices recently but the food is definitely worth it. a must get is the corn jeon, or gamja jungali think thats what it is called. they recently decreased the portion size of the dolsot bimbamp which is slightly dissapointing but oh well. bubble tea here is also one of the best ive had but not sure if it is worth 5. gonna try kbbq on wednesday.
this is my third review on this retaurant, and this time i really cant say anything other than this.you must visit this restaurant and order allyoucaneatgrill.im pretty sure that youll rate this review as useful after the first dish.
a perfect place to taste wonderfully cooked korean food. one of my favorites in town. worth a try if you are an asian food gourmet.
this is my new favorite place! i would always drag my boyfriend here and he would never complain he fell in love as well. we are still working on trying everything on the menu. we love the corn jeon the most and thats what make us come back to this place! always great service! :
rachel is my favorite of all the colorists and stylists i have been to in phoenixscottsdale and i always leave feeling clean and sexy. the new salon is great! the space really focuses the attention on you during your time there. great energy and friendly. i highly recommend rachel! :
ginger is an amazing stylist. i can go in feeling blah and bored with my style and come out looking fabulous! i completely trust her design sense. ginger goes above and beyond, not only doing the cut and color, but educating on how to best style your new cut and quality products to keep your hair healthy. highly recommend her! flexible hours as well, two thumbs up!
ginger is such a professional.  she gives great hair advice and the cuts are always on point.  much love to g. you wont be disappointed.  :
i have been going there for several months now. ginger is an amazing stylist. she listens well, is friendly, as is very confident and skilled. reasonable prices and they always play great music!
rachel bonn is one of the best! she has so much experience with color. she takes her time and makes sure you get exactly what you want! ill never go anywhere else! check it out!!!! you wont be disappointed!
rachel is an amazing stylist and colorist and the only person i trust my hair to!!! i was a little hesitant about going ombre with my asian hair but once she did it, i went back and became a blonde but not that orangey, cheap blonde that you see some asians get when they go blonde. she made my hair have lots of dimension and depth w warm and golden shades of blonde that matched my skin tone and features. that just says a lot about her skills!! book an appointment w her and you wont regret it!!!!
rachel is amazing! my boyfriend and i have both been seeing rachel for 5 years as well as my brother when he visits from london. studio 7 is the perfect place to relax and trust that you will leave feeling confident and more beautiful! your hair stays in style and condition after the cut which is so rare. i was so nervous to get highlights and wouldnt trust anyone but rachel. plus being stuck in a chair for 5 hours can suck but not with rachel in the studio! highly recommended!!!!
rachel bonn is amazing!  she does an awesome job on color for my hair, and ive never loved a haircut more!  also shes always willing to try to accommodate my last minute appointment requests!
i am a very nervous client. i am never happy with cuts and styles that i get. because of this i wait way too long between cuts and dread trying out new stylists. rachel patiently listened to all of my concerns. she was honest and have me real feedback when i had ideas that wouldnt be right for my face shape and hair type. because she took the time to listen to my concerns she was able to give me a hair style that lived up to my expectations and that i  absolutely love. i will be a loyal patron to studio 7 as long as they are taking customers. as an added bonus hanging out at the salon with rachel and ginger is about as much fun as you can have!
i have always been apprehensive about trusting anyone with my hair, due to many bad experiences.  i was so grateful to discover rachel!!!  not only is she an amazingly talented and gifted professional, she also has a great personality and very kind heart.  my husband and i absolutely love her and would never go anywhere else for services.  if you seek one of the best if not the best! in the valley, she is the lady to see.  she will keep you modern and young!
ginger gallardo is an incredible stylist. when ever i need a touch up to an old faded hair style or a new style all together she delivers. i have gone into the salon numerous times just wanting to redo my old style, but then have come out really excited about the updated look that was suggested. my husband loves the changes too! i highly recommend her to anyone looking for a professional stylist.
rachel is amazing! i have been going to her for almost two years now and always leave looking and feeling great. i followed her from her previous salon to her new space at studio no 7, which is fresh and serene.  rachel does an incredible job with color, cut, and style every time and is a pleasure to talk with.  she has a great vision  either working off of a picture i bring in or coming up with something new that always comes out looking great.  she is now using fabulous kevin murphy products.  definitely recommend rachel at studio no 7!
ive been going to rachel for over 13 yrs now...that saids a lot doesnt it?  shes magical with hair color! how she can transform my natural black hair to a gorgeous shade of blonde is incredible!  i get so many compliments on the color and i owe it all to her! i can honestly say i would never go anywhere else! shes a rockstar! do your hair a favor and go to rachel!
ginger is an amazing stylist. i can go in feeling blah and bored with my style and come out looking fabulous! i completely trust her design sense. ginger goes above and beyond, not only doing the cut and color, but educating on how to best style your new cut and quality products to keep your hair healthy. highly recommend her! flexible hours as well, two thumbs up!
came in at 5pm on a tuesday and ordered a gyro pita, chicken pita and combod for a drink and fries alot of food, but i was hungry. everything was cooked to order and served hot in a timely manner given the aforementioned. all of the staff were friendly and welcoming and the prices were reasonable. the menu is pretty big and offers something for everything. the decor is pretty basic, but once you sink your teeth into something you wont care. all in all, im glad to have a greek restaurant in my neck of the woods to sate my cravings affordably.
the family was in the 3rd or 4th day they were open and had a great meal. i had  a gryosthe pita and tzaziki were really good making it stand out from other places, plus the have the cone instead of the strips of meat most places use, which is always better. the side of fries was really good as well. the wife got the pork souvlaki plate the greek style green beans were really good and the side of grilled bread instead of a standard pita is a nice change of pace. as for the pork, it was probably the best pork souvlaki ive had outside of greece, well other than my dads. as good as the gyros and souvlaki were the real stars of the day were the 300 burger my son ordered and the htipiti. the 300 is a nice sized burger topped w gryos meat, feta, red onions and tzaziki, great idea and great mix of flavors. hitipit is a dip made of feta and peppers not super spicy but enough heat to bring real flavor. you dont see htipit on menus too often, i think spartan may be the only place in the valley with it. they do this dish extremely well, not sure if ive ever had better anywhere. this is defiantly the dish to try at spartan. as much as we love the gyros place a little north of here on indian school, spartan is already the familys new favorite.
best new gyrogreek place around! delicious gyros, veggies, spicy feta and salads. adding this to my weekly takeout! affordable and great portions. ill definitely be back!
just had their hummus and gyro both were very fresh amazing food.. very nice friendly staff..i definitely recommend this place
food comes fresh and hot very tasty and def genuine service. i recommend this spot to anyone looking for great gyrosgreekfriesphilly baguette.
just opened 3 wks. owner was friendly and helpful. food was very tasty and affordable. nice clean ambiance. pork gyro was delicious. pita bread is soft and tasty.
excellent gyro combo.  the meat is the best ive had in this neighborhood.   fries were great!   tzatziki  sauce was great.   pita great!   even the restaurant decor was great!   i will absolutely be back there.   cant wait to try other stuff on the menu.
what a great little spot! the owner was extremely friendly and helpful and even recommended an off menu item... try the philly gyro! looks amazing inside and good food! definitely check it out...
hands down the best in the area.owner was very hospitable. felt like i was eating in a families home. we had the philly gyro and the chicken souvlaki.chicken was amazing, juicy and home made tzatziki was the best ive had make it a combo and get those amazing fries. great place, clean and homely highly recommend this place  this is now our new favorite spot.
this place is fantastic.  all the greek food ive tried is dlish, super fresh, best in town.  also love their nongreek items.  the asian salad is so clean  yummy, a must try if youre not in the mood for the best gyros in town....
great food! chicken souvlaki was great!  the italian sandwich was great!  good size portion and fries were addictive. kids got cheese burgers and it filled them up.
blown away by this place. usually eat at zs or chicago gyro once or twice a week, but wanted to give this place a try. after i ordered and paid, i watched the cook go over to the sink and wash his hands before cooking. i thought this place had a better tasting pita, better tasting gyro meat and better tasting tzatziki sauce than both zs or chicago gyro. i like how after they cut the gyro meat they put it on the flat top and crisp it up a bit. i am looking forward to trying their 300 burger next visit.
this is a nice little place conveniently located on the north side of thomas across from arcadia crossing in a recently remodeled shopping center.  first time here and so i started with the basics...gyro pita!  the  meat was tender and the tzatziki was fresh full of flavor and the pita was fresh.  the staff was friendly and welcoming, i will definitely be back to try more menu items.
great selection of greek food. started with a salad which was nice and fresh. gyro was amazing! very warm, even to the last bite. bakalava for desert was also very delicious. staff is very friendly, decor fits the tone as well. great food, was stuffed and was not overall expensive. taste of greece right here in phoenix. definitely plan on returning soon. look forward to trying other things on the menu as well.
we have really enjoyed this place and have come back over and over again.  the owners both named nick remodeled the restaurant and that was a huge improvement.  but more importantly, the food is really, really good!  we have had the gyro, chicken souvlaki plate, greek salad, 300 burger burger with feta cheese and gyro meat on top and other dishes.  they make home made tasting meals and they are both just the nicest guys too.  worth a visit or 10!
a great hole in the wall greek restaurant in arcadia. ive enjoyed various dinner platters and the tzatziki is delicious.
great salad there today for my 1st trip.  really glad to have these guys as another great option in my neighborhood!
delicious food!!
this place is gooooood!  the staff is super friendly and the food is amazing.  the gyros are def the best in town.  salads are freaking huge!  they even handed me two coupons for my next visit.  safe to say ill be using those soon!  highly recommend.
holy greek salad goodness, spartan knows how to make a mean greek salad! and that says a lot coming from me, ive had just about every greek salad in the valley! : the veggies are so fresh, chicken kabobs were grilled to perfection and the homemade vinaigrette dressing was light and perfect. we also got their greek poutine which was a bowl layered with french fries, feta cheese, greek green beans wred sauce a greek tomato sauce and topped with feta again. i could literally eat these all day, every day, they were so good! my boyfriend had the gyro cheesesteak and was raving about it the entire time that he was eating it. i had a bite and oh my goodness, it really was amazing. if youre looking for a quick, easy, fresh, and delicious lunch or dinner spot. this is your place!!!!
for under 10, you can get a fresh, authentic meal at spartan that will fill you to bursting. i usually go with the greek pita. the lamb is cut from the bone in front of you, the pita is soft and warm, the tzatziki is to die for, and all that is topped off with freshly chopped tomatoes and onions. niko, either the owner or manager, is always there with a contagious smile and happy demeanor. the decor is clean and minimalistic, and the shop is always pristine and caredfor. ill sometimes go to spartan several times a week...its that good.
best greek food.  we had the gyros, greek fries,  greek salad and the greek soup.  we also had a fried pita with honey, almonds, and yogurt which was an awesome combo.  these guys take pride in everything they make.  super clean.  we will be back soon!
had some friends mention this place.  best gyro ive had in phoenix.   prices are right too.  ill be frequenting this place for sure.
i really like coming to this place. .. everyone is very friendly and the place is clean... by far, one of the better places ive been to. the hot stone massage is great
i love this fletchers! they have helped me so many times! and one of these last time was when i popped my tire! i was really in a jam and they were able to get my new tire to the location and put it on in a matter of hours! daniel lucas really cares about his customers and knows how to keep them happy. he is personable, friendly, and really knows his stuff. thank you guys for all of your hard work. i moved about 20 min away and i still come back to this location for all of my auto needs! i highly recommend this location! thank you! thank you! thank you!
great customer service, knowledgeable staff, and competitive pricing. thank you daniel for all your help.
best pizza in the area. the restaurant has a home and cozy feel. the calamaris are pretty amazing and the chicken wings are there to compete. great ingredients and dough make the difference for me. the menu features a few unconventional items you wont see in other pizzerias.
nov 14th i came in to get a haircut; i work at the port of subs across the parking lot. they opened this location recently, and told us about it. i came in for something different than most salons giving me that a line haircut: a mohawk. my hairstylist sara was great. this sounds really boring but i definitely wanted her to get recognition for such a great job. if theres multiple ones then its the blonde one with tattoos.
i always get top notch service! sharron is an expert at mens cuts, usually i am super picky, yet she nails it every time with a perfect fade!! she uses excellent clippers, showing care in her profession. thank you sharron!
i used to go to a barber shop and get hit in my pocket pretty bad every time. now i can go get cleaned up every two weeks with out the long wait and expensive rates. all the girls there do a great job and very friendly. and checking in online so im not sitting and waiting forever is the best. no complaints about this location at all specially being half a mile from the house.
quick and easy, very reasonably priced. installation went as advertised and the entire crew was courteous and professional. would definitely recommend to friends and family.
i recently used this company for just a few led canned lights for my kitchen.  i went online and they had their prices right on their website!  i liked that i could just set up an appointment and i bought the lighting package of 4 can lights for 550.  the scheduled this about a week out and had it all done same day.  very professional and clean.  i really like that the prices were online and they came through.  i am going to replace a few ceiling fans in the next few months and will use them for that as well since their prices are great for that as well....and online too.
okay...  so my wife wanted to improve the look of our kitchen and said that our old light fixtures were outdated...  my wife suggested that the nfl sunday ticket was not a necessity this year and that the improvement of our kitchen was a wiser choice.   in a last ditch effort to retain my frosty beverage and football approval for the remainder of the footbal season i had to take action so i hopped on the internet and took the plunge.  i found az recessed lighting and to my surprise they had a package deal on their website that looked like it would work for us.  the company came out, did the job quickly and cleaned up well, and the price was as it was quoted at the end of the job.  the lights work as they should, my wife is happy, and i can watch football in peace....  happy ending and a good experience.
i called the owner troy, and its very important that you understand that youre talking to the owner when you call. troy showed up and gave me a bid for some hallway recessed lighting, despite the older house and the ductwork above the ceiling. troy made it work exactly as i had asked. not to mention he didnt charge me any extra money for the time he spent in my attic figuring out how to put the lighting around the ductwork. i actually tipped him well for the hard work and sweat he put in in my attic during 106° heat.
nice decor. good staff. very friendly!  and they have a drivethru as well for ya that dont want to have to get out of your car. sandwich was made fast and fixings were nice and fresh. bread was soft and tasty. drive they alert was the only neg to my visit. its loud and rather irritating as it keeps alarming the entire time a car is sitting there. not sure who came up with that plan.
this camp is fabulous. run by karyn miller, the principal of fountain hills charter school, this camp is as good as day camps get. karyns exuberance and love for working with children comes through in every aspect of this camp. she hand picks counselors who share her enthusiasm, making for a positive environment filled with fun activities arts and crafts, archery, sports, water play, and a host of other creative activities, friendship, and happy children. my son comes home from his day tired and happy. hes graduated to camper leader this year and is loving it! what a gem to have here in fountain hills. she sends vans to pick up in scottsdale too!
we had such a great experience with cactus day camp. as a total helicopter mom, im a little bit nervous leaving my kids with anyone for the first time. but this camp was held at our kids regular school campus, with a lot of admin working there, so we felt good about giving a couple sessions a shot between summer trips. our son had the best time  it was more like going away to a real camp in that karyn the owner brought in a huge water slide, archery, swimming, arts and crafts, and held lots of special activities including a cookout on fridays. my husband and i were impressed at the counselors assigned to small groups of kids, and that our sons counselor called before the first day of camp to introduce himself. everyday our son would come home exhausted and happy from a fun day and telling us how much he likes ms karyn. we also enjoyed the photos that were sent at the end of each session showing the kids and counselors having fun. overall it was a fantastic experience and i think it made my son excited for the school year and seeing his friends again. were hoping the camp will be at our school again next year.
i recently purchased a home and only a few days in, my ac went out.  i had to go through my home warranty, and the first company i was set up with for my  emergency claim would not return a single call.  my home warranty company then gave me freds heating and coolings number and not only did fred answer on the first call, he was there the same day. my boyfriend, who has a hvac background but couldnt touch the unit for warranty purposes agreed that fred was fair, honest and quickly diagnosed and fixed the problem.  he told us other add ons that were optional and would make the unit more efficient but were not necessary.after being fed up with other companies, it was refreshing to meet fred and will be calling him for future hvac needs.
amazing restaurant  one of the best ive visited in montreal. its only been open for a few weeks, and will soon become very popular im sure. i dined with a couple of colleagues, and between us, we tried everything on the menu. the focus is on local, fresh and high quality foods.  frankly, every dish was amazing and its hard to call out anything in particular.  having said that, the foie gras was out of this world, as were the duck and steak dishes.  he chef was able to combine flavours that are not normally seen in an extremely effective and super tasty way. the service was also very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable.  they recommended great wines to accompany our meal, and went to great lengths to ensure we enjoyed everything. its a fairly small restaurant, with a great ambience. ill definitely be back, and recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something a little different and is big on taste and flavour.
we came here as a family of 5 and absolutely loved it! the food was delicious and exciting and the service was great. we highly recommend ordering as many plates as possible to share as it allows you to taste the full breadth of the menu. the ambience is fun and lively and the venue is cozy and well decorated. very highly recommended and we look forward to returning!  thanks for a wonderful meal!
if you walked into this restaurant on what would certainly be a rare slow night, youd never imagine the pure magic that occurs if you only considered the decor.  we were lucky to snag two seats during a short visit, and sat down at 9:30 in a packed restaurant in the states wed already be closing up for the night.  our servers were young ladies, very knowledgeable of the menu and ingredients, and enthusiastic.  the menu and presentation is a tasting design, these are not full servings.  but the food is magic!  first course we started with endive and walnut salad, and the famous pbjfg.  if youre a heart patient you should run for the door now!  the peanut butter and foie gras melt together and turn into this delicious rich emulsion on toast with just a touch of sweetness.  next was the sirloin with salsify and truffle.  then fish with leeks and lemon grass and finally the morel and galic toffee.  go with an open mind, try anything that strikes your fancy...this is a culinary adventure...really!for dessert i had the malted ice cream sandwich and my wife had the fig phylo.if i had any negative comment, id like slightly larger portions on some of the dishes!
had one of the most memorable meals of my life. we ordered the tasting menu, and each and every dish was better than the next. some of the combinations sounded a little peculiar to me at first, like the morrel mushrooms and caramel... but i was blown away.sitting at the bar we were able to chat with the bartender who really took the time to explain the wines to us and let us try some rather unique options. the staff were all really friendly, and we even got the chance to chat to the owner and the chef towards the end of the night.if you are lucky you might be able to try their offthemenu pbj sandwich. well worth a visit, the prices were incredibly reasonable and i will definitely be back.
i lost my keys to my car at the mgm called top master locksmith they came in 30 mins , great customer servicethe price was decent , definitely use them again
i locked myself out of my home late one night and needed a locksmith. i found top master locksmith online and gave them a call. they arrived quickly, charged a fair price 75, yes, 75 may seem high but i was previously gouged by a locksmith who charged me 150 to get my front door unlocked so i consider this a decent deal. i would use them again.
i lost my car in las vegas called lots of locksmith in las vegas no had a key to my 2016 ford focus , i called top master locksmith , the lady on the phone was very nice to me and send some one over in 20 mins and they were the cheapest ones in las vegas , if u dont wanna be robbed by other locksmith in vegas for car key call top master locksmith.
best locksmith in las vegas, every time i have a key issue of any sort he comes to the rescue.  ive known this man since before he was located on dean martin with an office  employees.  its been about 34 years of him always being able to help me with any lock or situation.  i highly recommend the company, if u have lock trouble call top master they will definitely figure it out.
i have to said this is the best haircut and color i ever got. i explained to melissa what i wanted and she understood exactly. she was so fun to talk as she was colored and cut my hair. my hair look so good! i also got a gel polish manicure. it was really nice and relaxing. my nails feel and look great. she is the nice, kind, caring, funny lady. melissa definitely knows what she is doing. she pays close attention to every detail. i am definitely going back to melissa. i highly recommended anyone to go see melissa.
ea restoration came out and took care of a moldy wall in my garage.  they were awesome!  they were flexible to find a time that worked with me and when they showed up, they got right to work and worked late into the night to get the job done.  they were polite and exhibited very good communication on exactly what they were doing.  im very impressed with their service and would definitely recommend them to someone else.
im an air conditioning contractor and i have been involved with jobs and referred to jobs by ea restoration. these guys know what theyre doing and they do the job right. thats what you look for with the kind of work they do. they know how to deal with insurance agents and home owners alike to make sure you get all the mold or whatever it is that they are eliminating from your house. highly recommend them. craig is really good at estimating the jobs and not missing anything.
i worked with ea restoration twice this year and both experiences have been tremendously great. this past summer my hot water heater burst and flooded my home, and during the initial clean up i discovered that my house was full of asbestos. ea restoration conducted the asbestosrelated clean up issues. they were efficient and fast and their crew was meticulous when cleaning any mess that was made. the owners, craig and cavin, were incredibly thorough in their explanations of the work being done on my home, and they were both quick to respond to my voice messages, emails and texts. i was very impressed with their work and hired them again to perform an asbestos abatement demolition of a home renovation project. again, ea restoration was a super choice. i am very pleased with their work and highly recommend this company.
major barbershop is firstclass! excellent haircut with outstanding service! i just moved here from st. louis and a friend recommended major barbershop. this is my new haircut spot for sure. keep up the great work!
upscale barbershop with hometown feel. ive been getting my haircut from niki for years now and im glad to see shes finally opened up her own place with victoria and yvette. they have a great location with easy parking, best prices and best quality haircut in town. must go check them out!
i just met victoria and told her about my busy schedule . she offered to cut my hair on a sunday when it worked with my schedule . they had a nice salon and it was one of the best haircuts i had gotten in a long time . i definitely recommend this place . jamie starnes
nikki is a magician! i wanted to get my cousin a really great haircut for his 18th birthday present. she was so accommodating for a last minute haircut on a sunday! he loves his first haircut! thank you nikki!
upscale barbershop with hometown feel. ive been getting my haircut from niki for years now and im glad to see shes finally opened up her own place with victoria and yvette. they have a great location with easy parking, best prices and best quality haircut in town. must go check them out!!!
great service and the stylists are awesome!! they always taken great care me, and always nice to have a drink while i get a haircut!! try it and you wont be disappointed!
absolutely the best haircut i have received in charlotte. not only do you get a great cut, but they actually use a straight razor on the back of your neck. this is something sorely lacking in other places that cater to men. relax, have a drink and get a great cut for less than those chain male barber shops charge. they are so accommodating when it comes to schedules and they even cut hair on sundays if they need to. i cant say enough about this place and will  always come back!!!
wonderful ladies just passing though on business. will definitely go back. these ladies treated me well it was an enjoyable experience and i will tell others. great job
great barbers... and really great people too!
major barbershop is convenient to the southenddilworth area, right of east blvd. it has its own parking lot behind the building which makes it easy in and out. it is a great experience overall. top notch service with a hot towel neck and face treatment, straight razor neck trim, scissor cut, shampoo and condition. yvette, does a great job and is very personable. i would recommend major barbershop to any male who likes their haircuts to be an experience.
if you are looking for the best mens haircut experience, look no further than majors barbershop. i moved to charlotte a year ago, found niki at another salon and have never gone to anyone else since my first visit with her. she does an exceptional job, treats her clients with respect, listens to what type of cut you are wanting and provides you with second to none customer service.also while you are there let them take care of all your grooming needs. she can clean up your eyebrows, provide an exceptional shave and will keep your neckline and sides trimmed in between haircuts.exceptional atmosphere, great private parking make this the perfect location in south end  dilworth. make an appointment in the afternoon and enjoy a cold beverage while you wait or while getting groomed.if you are looking for a great mens haircut experience, any of these three ladies at majors can fix you up!
first off, let me say, my hair is curly. really curly.  and i am picky.  i came in with a mop of it and photo on my phone.  almost never do i ever get a cut that i dont have to clip away at, to fix it, when i get home. today was not one of those times. niki knows what shes doing!  scissors cut throughout, razor neck shave, and a shampoo, hot towel and scalp massage that is awesome!  also, make sure to call for an appointment prior.
i went in to major barbershop for the first time while visiting my girlfriend and niki was incredible. she takes her time with you and i absolutely loved my haircut. for the amount of attention she gives you and the quality of the haircut, there isnt a better deal in town!
one of the best haircuts i have had. not only is the atmosphere perfect but the neck shave is awesome. in addition, the head and neck massage go above and beyond. all around one of the best i have had. and i travel and get a trim every 3 weeks!!!
all the staff are professional and friendly. the prices were very reasonable and quality was above average! victoria does and amazing job. the team was able to accommodate my husbands needed haircut at short notice and he left very impressed by the staff and his cut. he will definitely be back again!
fantastic is not too good to say, this is simply the best barber i have been to.  i am soooooooo impressed.  she faded my beard like a pro.  she was great to chat with, great relaxing atmosphere, as arnold once said i will be back.   i saw nikki btw.the barber is upstairs.
i can confidently say this is the best haircut ive ever gotten  greatrelaxing environment, stellar  attentive service, top products used, the list goes on.  victoria is the bomb!
ciara gives the most flawless airbrush tans! i always leave feeling like a million bucks  my color is a golden brown, i never have any streakyness, nobody would ever guess it wasnt a real tan! she makes an uncomfortable situation getting naked comfortable, we have so much fun and end up laughing the whole time. she has my vote
i had feathers put in my hair twice by ciara, i love them. she is very friendly and i will definitely be going back to her.
i had a facial by ciara.  oh my!  i had no idea a facial would make me feel like melting into the table.  i had to sit in my truck a bit before driving home  i got the best nights sleep that night. never had a facial feel so darned good!  i will be back!
ciara is wonderful.  she does great facials and is very gentle.  i had some issues with my skin and she was able to attack the problem areas. thanks ciara, see you again soon.  heidi
i rarely leave reviews. that being said i have to let the world know that ciarra not only gave me the best facial i have ever had. she also managed to make me relax enough to enjoy it! i have a hard time relaxing. her amazing personality put me right at ease. you can tell right off the get go she knows what she is doing and she is a beautiful person!
i stopped by this shop for the first time on first friday. there was a crowd in there, but i made my way through and what initially caught my attention were these cute little succulents in magnetic pots stuck on all of the pipes lining the shop only 7. id been looking for a friend to share my apartment with, so i made a mental note of those cuties.there were terrariums and an assortment of different plants of various sizes. awesome plant related prints as well, which would be perfect to put up on any wall.the location of the shop is pretty neat too, since its part of a larger space, leading to an art gallery and cafe.i ended up buying the potted plant, and it is currently stuck on the lamp stand in my room.
awesome plant boutique in phoenix. eclectic  quirky to spice up the nursery crowd. great prices and the owners are very informed about each of their plants to send you home knowing how to care for it. definitely check it out! could make a great gift!
this little place is so cute! full of the unusual, hard to find and exotic species in all sorts of interesting planters, mounts, and even shells. the guy running the place really knows his stuff, and is a pleasure to talk to. price are low for what it is, and plants are of much higher quality than, say, the garden section at home depot. amazing place, i love it  keep it up!!!
i love this place! ive stopped by to pick up unique gifts twice now. some of the plants are so magical that they almost trick me into thinking i wouldnt forget to water them if i brought them home for myself. mike is a super helpful and friendly arizona native who takes pride in his shop. definitely  worth taking a look! the location is pretty neat, too. last thing  hes got a potting station set up, so if you buy a plant and a pot to go with it if it doesnt already come in a nice one, hell pot it right there for you. that saved me from having to buy a small bag of soil for a single plant.
what a great clean bakery! quality is amazing. european torts, french and armenian cakes. designs are super creative and beautiful, and price point totally affordable.. highly recommending this place.  give them your love and lets support a new local business.
the best cheese turnover ive ever had in my life. 100  recommended. and i recommend for everybody to try it. amazing
stopped here today, as its convenient to my house, and i remembered seeing a positive review a few days beforehand. was debating between four and five stars but definitely five because it is what it is and its done great. a barbershop, not a salon or some chain, but a barbershop by a friendly guy named vernon. when i came in he was giving a shave to someone! i thought awesome, a lot of places dont do that anymore.  i got a great haircut at a good price, and will definitely be back. highly recommended.
what a gem! krystle did my hair and makeup for a family picture shoot  i was reluctant at first to have it done professionally because i normally just do everything myself, however the results were so amazing and there is no comparing the job i would have done to her professional artistry. thanks krystle for your professionalism, talent, and kindness! ill be booking you again for sure!
when it comes to makeup in vegas, krystle is your girl.  professional, fast and supremely talented.  ive worked with her several times and have never had a bad experience.  hire krystle.
beyond amazing is all i can say. the work that krystal does is hands down the best in  las vegas. krystal did my makeup for my wedding and i was blown away with the results. my whole family was blown away. i never saw so many teary eyes as i walked down the isle. my father was speechless. he got very the teary eyed out of anyone. my father, so you know, is one of those guys that never sheds a tear. on my wedding day was the first time i had seen that side of him. he cried. he had a few teary streams go down his cheeks. since that day   i still havent seen him shed a tear since. i got married on halloween  and  i encouraged everyone to dress in costume for the nuptials. my husband decided to be a devil for our special day. he had lived in las vegas before we had met so he made a few phone calls and was given krystals name from a friend.  i must say it was the best referral ever. krystal did such an amazing job on his makeup that i had a hard time not getting freaked out while we said our vows! i dressed up as a bride and kinda vamped out my wedding dress just a tad for the occasion. krystal did a phenomenal job on my makeup and hair. my hair and makeup were perfect. i have baby fine hair and what ever she did to my hair to make it stay perfect 10 hours later i will never know. but it stayed perfect all day. i need to know her magic!  not only is she an amazing artist on every level but i found out that she has an amazing heart. we became friends on facebook shortly after my wedding. we kept in touch regularly. my husband passed away in an automobile accident  312 years after we were  married. krystal was one of my rocks when it came to getting past the grief. her heart is true. we still keep in contact till this day  and its been 2 years this june that i lost my husband. hands down krystal  is a definite a.  book her before someone else does!
absolutely the best hair and makeup artist in town! krystle is reliable, friendly, professional, and her work speaks for itself. she is truly an artist at her craft. a magician! she also specializes in body paint and latex body paint! she did an amazing job on my fiance and i for halloween last year!
amazing amazing amazing!!!! i worked with her at stk and she is one of the best artists in town! not only did she work fast under pressure but she also delivered a beautiful product that completely exceeded all expectations.  such a pleasure to work with and we will definetily use her again!
krystle and her associates are great  punctual, and they know what they are doing! carly was my stylistartist and she was great.  it was for a costume party and she nailed it!  great service and reliable, professional!
krystle is an all around artist.  she does the most gorgeous bridal makeup for your special day, body paint you for a special treat for your guy and if special fx is your thing she can make you a zombie. i have been a colleague of her for 10 years and j can always cant on krystle for many different looks!
if you love great coffee, friendly people, excellent breakfast  lunch sandwiches with insanely fresh ingredients that are made to order for you, and a cool open space with which to enjoy your bounty, then be coffee  food  stuff is your place. i stopped by and was greeted by a friendly guy named troy, who walked me through their menu, patiently shared with me his favorites and made a unique breakfast sandwich just for me! and, in supporting this local business you are also supporting a local coffee company how awesome?!?! go to be coffee  youll leave happier than you arrived for sure!!! ps. plus the building is really cool with an art gallery and a little fresh plant store to check out while you are there! pps. i was told you can also rent out the space for parties! what the what?!?! go already!!!
talk about being awesome! this place has got it going on! love the drip coffee service they have going on. and they are always coming up with new stuff all the time!
friendly and sincere service and in an incredibly cool shop paired with delicious food make this place incomparably great.
checked out this shop when they first opened. very friendly and helpful staff! the breakfast sammy was just what i needed that morning too.
great service! the moment we walked in a dog greted us!  i love dogs and that made me happy and also the service was great food was up top great. im not a morning person or eat breakfast but my family and i were down here for my brothers college. but great everything overall.
such a fun, quirky place to grab some coffee or brekky. super friendly, personable staff. very reasonably priced  a big delish brekky sammy was only 6 : really chill, relaxed ambience. come grab a bite and stay a while :
awesome location, great service, friendly staff, an affordable menu, and my newfavorite cold brew coffee. be coffee  food  stuff is brand new to the downtown phoenix and roosevelt row scene and has certainly hit the ground running on all cylinders.ive yet to try any of the food, but its definitely on my list. ive heard nothing but good things from a number of people that i trust. im also familiar with the owners and have experienced their knack for delicious food firsthand.i mentioned the cold brew: if youre a coffee nerd like i am, you can rest assured knowing that be coffee  food  stuff uses premium locallyroasted beans and brews the cold brew for a solid 24 hours before serving. and you can tell! its my new goto.the location is small, but it has been laid out really well, providing a surprising amount of space given its size. its also set within one of the coolest buildings in phoenix and opens right up into a couple of tiny retail stores and a wellknown gallery open to the public, which makes for a fun visit.parking appears somewhat of an issue at first blush, but i was happy to find that there was plenty of free street parking all around the building. e portland street, directly behind the building, is your best bet if you cant manage to snag a spot in the lot.do yourself a favor and check these guys out if you havent already had the opportunity to visit. i know ill be going back!
hubby  i each had breakfast sandwiches on mj english muffinsyummy! taking 12 of my sandwich home.fast service..love the decor..very nice  personable owner.definitely will be returning. : 
they have a great cold brew. the kind with a strong flavorful essence. the  english egg sammy was also enjoyable. different and better from your typical dry rough english muffin sandwiches. i had the one with avocado, tomato and muenster. i gotta say i absolutely devoured it! had the pleasure of meeting the owner q, great guy! definitely give it a try if you are looking for some new and refreshing!
be is so rad! so many coffee shops have a were better than you vibe, but this place does not at all, and everything on the menu is delicious. my two favorites are the apple fritter and the be sammy. do yourself a favor and check this place out!
great place for the riders. nice people and food. not crowd. outside table is awesome.
friendly service and absolutely delicious sammies! my husband and i look forward to our friday morning date here all week. its a really beautifully decorated space, as well, with local art hung and you can peek into monorchid on your way to the ladies room. great place to do a couple of hours of work nice atmosphere and music selection is great and not too loud. check it out if you havent!
this used to be songbird coffee house which relocated. and these guys somehow have made this place even better than songbird. excellent coffee. extremely friendly staff. absolutely delicious sandwiches. must try the egg and cheese sandwich. a great addition to the neighborhood. this is our go to spot for breakfast and coffee on the weekends.
walked in and was greeted by everyone who works there. very friendly and professional staff! asked what they would recommend and was given the suggestion of the be sammy. it was absolutely delicious, we will be back!!
this is a great little coffee shop with nice service and hot tasty coffee. go with the pour over! their food looked good too and not too many choices which a plus for me. any cafe with nutella on the menu gets bonus stars from me. this cafe is on the same floor as the mon orchid gallery and coworking space as it is also a member. dont forget to get your oxygen supply as you take a look at the bosque plant shop next door there and make friends with the shops guard :
this place is so cute and comfy. came here to spend time with my niece and have a nice conversation about her schooling. great coffee hangout spot with yummy food.
the food was delicious. we had the chorizo egg scramble and the avocado, tomato, muenster and egg sandwich. both were truly great. great space in a cool building with an art gallery and plant store. the staff was incredibly friendly. enjoy it and say hello to tj and troy!
wow  this place is truly amazing!  we stopped in this morning to grab a cup of tea and ended up staying for breakfast and a sweet treat!  first off, the staff is so super friendly  thanks to tj and team for making us feel so welcome!  we both ordered the english egg sammy and it was like no other breakfast sandwich i have have eaten  super fresh english muffin the best, eggs with herbs and onions, a thin slice of ham and muenster cheese...absolute perfection!  i enjoyed a nicely brewed lemon chamomile tea with my amazing sandwich and took a little extra to go with me.  we were also tempted by the amazing chocolate chip cookies that were begging us to buy one when we ordered.  boy, am i glad we did  it was seriously one of the best cookies i have ever eaten.  i knew it would be good when the staff wouldnt let us leave until we each took a bite as they wanted to see our expression!  they were freshly baked that morning and it was so evident in their fresh, amazing taste.i cant recommend this place enough...truly worth a visit!
delicious food, the best coffee and im from seattle, great service, and tj is super welcoming. we had the be sammy and the avocado and tomato  both were very tasty. they hit the spot. had to get a cookie for the road  also delicious. highly recommended.
amazing cocoa with homemade marshmallow for the kids and delicious coffee. this is a great shop with a relaxed atmosphere. definitely worth a stop when in the downtown area.
i found ashley on yelp i believe a couple of years ago when she was with another salon. i absolutely love her and will follow her anywhere! she is now on her own at wicked waxing. when you are going for any type of bikini or other wax, i feel that professionalism and confidence in the person is paramount. that person has to be trusted in so many ways. ashley is all that. she puts you at ease and knows many techniques to ease the potential pain. a friend of mine that i referred to her even said it wasnt nearly as bad as i thought it would be. for all your waxing needs, male or female, trust ashley!
ashley is absolutely amazing! ive been seeing her for a long time now and highly recommend her. extremely professional. you wont regret trying wicked waxing. trust me. youll become a loyal customer and wish you would have known sooner!
ashley is the greatest. after being abandon by 2 other waxers at other places who quit in the last 6 yrs, i got lucky enough to be set up with ashley. and ive never left her. im always comfortable and she is always extremely efficient. i like that i have a standing appt and i always know ill have two perfectly shaped and manicured eyebrows and a clean, smooth upper lip among other things when were finished. since i usually have to schedule my waxing mid work day, its a huge, huge deal that i never get any swelling, bumps or redness and can confidently go right back to work and deal with clients without wondering how i look or experiencing that post wax discomfort. i cant recommend her enough.
i followed ashley from her previous employer when she broke out on her own. havent regretted it ever. i own my own business too and sometimes scheduling is a hassle. ashley is always cool and gets me rescheduled. she is professional and personable at the same time. to top it off she does a kick ass job. you wont regret trying her and i bet  you become a regular!
ashley is absolutely the best ever!!! i have been her client for a couple of years and followed her from her previous place. she finally established her own business. ashley is very skilled at her work. she pays attention to detail and has been very flexible with scheduling.  i have been to many other waxing places and no one else can compare to ashley. her location is also very convenient. also very clean and comfortable. trust me you will become a frequent client. ;
ashley is fantastic. ive been with her for several years now, and theres no question  shes incredibly skilled, thorough, and professional. whats more, she has a gift for helping me feel completely at ease during all of my appointments, so i never feel embarrassed or uncomfortable while doing different treatments. cant recommend her enough!
this place is so cute. its very quiet and clean. at night time the lights are more dim to give this calm vibe.i ordered the rose milk tea with boba. they brew tea and cook fresh boba everyday. it tastes really delicious. the boba is soft to chew with the perfect texture. thanks guys. :
great place that has been open for less than a month. they took over cefiore due to them going out of business. they make all their drinks and boba fresh. i got the taro milk tea and it was made with steamed taro rather than powder and had actual taro pieces. staff is welcoming and happy to answer any questions or requests. they offered making our drinks again if they werent to our liking but that wasnt necessary. they also serve crepes in a japanese style c:very great place and wish them the best.
this is the best milk tea place youll find in southwest las vegas! im so glad i live five minutes away from here.every milk tea ive tried so far has been delicious and i cant wait to try all their other flavors. their taro milk tea is very unique compared to other places because they use real taro and no powder. as for service, everyone is very friendly and helpful. theyre always willing to adjust your drinks for you if it is not to your liking. the place itself is very relaxing, clean, and cute. theres also no card minimum and the price here is very reasonable for drink size :3 i will definitely come back here every time i get a chance.
i was super excited to find a boba shop  opened on this side of town! my family and i ordered jasmine milk tea, almond milk tea, and the hokkaido milk tea! the refreshing drinks with boba definitely hit the spot. if youre looking for something creamy and milky, the hokkaido may be for you! definitely looking forward to try their other drinks! i definitely love how accommodating the service is, as well as the wide variety of drinks! : :1010
great new boba place!! i got the rose milk tea and im completely satisfied! staff is friendly and accommodating! theres plenty of selections and natural teas. cant wait to try them when i come back again!
great new tea place in vegas. tried their strawberry latte. absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!!!!  workers here are super nice as well. will definitely come back next time im in the area. love this place.
the best milk tea place in southwest las vegas! i love the quality of their drinks always the right amount of sweetness and average priced. the staff was nice and helpful.
brew tea bar has the best boba in all of vegas! tastes just like my favorite boba place in california : the staff are super friendly and fast. my favorite drink here is jasmine milk tea. so happy this place opened up! will definitely be back!
the interior is very simplistic and pleasing to look at and the atmosphere is great with very kind staff : their the brew milk tea is delicious as well as their honey boba. the wait time for your drink is really quick. 1010 would get drinks from here again.
after coming here for 5 times in a week and filling up. stamp card already, i can confidently say this is the best boba in vegas. cheers!
my family and i found this new tea spot close to our home and decided to try it out. it was a hit and so delicious! i purchased the brew milk tea. a bold tea flavor with a little touch of sweetness. it was just right. you have to check it out! im sure the rest of their drinks are well worth it. now if i have a craving i know where to go. and its not on spring mountain! cant wait to drink more of their yummy beverages
super cute little boba spot. i got the oolong milk tea because i like a strong tea flavor and the amount of boba they gave is pretty good. it was nice and cold and the sweetness was perfect.  normally i would ask for super sweet but they got it down to the tea! :p
as a boba enthusiast, i had to give this new boba shop a visit. keep in mind, i have tried almost all, if not all boba shops that exist in las vegas as of now. they have only been open for 25 days but i can see this place gain in popularity in no time. serviceimpressed, is all i can say. greeted by two young gentlemen with a smile and both were quick to assist me. drinks came out within minutes and was told that i can make adjustments if the drink is too sweet. drinkmenu is very simple. they have slushes m:3.95 l:4.95, latte tea m:3.75 l:4.75, ice tea m:2.85 l:3.85, milk tea m:3.50 l:4.50 and fresh brew large size only and is 4.95. they also have some crepe 4.50. toppings they have are honey boba, lychee jelly and egg pudding which are all 50 cents. all of their teas are freshly brewed and each drink is made to order. jasmine milk teadefinitely on the sweeter side, light on milk and has good tea flavor. i appreciate that jasmine milk tea here did not taste artificial like other places. i got this on my first visit with their honey boba which had perfect texture and a bold honey flavor which i loved. oolong lattestrong tea flavor, not too sweet. i believe all of their latte teas automatically comes with sea salt cream on top. server here told me not to mix in the cream with tea, and to let the sea salt milk drizzle down with time. i actually think everything mixed in is better. i still prefer the oolong milk tea from kung fu tea since their oolong tea, milk and sugar is balanced perfectly. oolong latte here is much more teay. perhaps asking for more milk or extra cream would make me like this particular drink more. hokkaido milk teavery thick and rich, personally too heavy in milk. i dont know what tea is used for this drink but it was very light. on the sweeter side. too milky for me but i know hokkaido milk teas are made like that. some of my friends have mentioned that you can truly customize your drink. i know that kung fu tea brought an ordering system inspired by boba shops in taiwan where you can adjust the sweetness, ice level and milk. however, you are limited on customization due to their franchise rule. over here, you can truly customize your drink. what i mean by that is, you can make any customization from the menu and create a drink that is unique to you. menu is simple by the looks, but there are myriads of options. for example, my friend had her cantaloupe green tea customized into a milk tea. it turned out to be a super yummy drink! dont be afraid to make customization because if you dont like your drink, they will gladly remake your drink. awesome!another plus is that they have a stamp card! 1 free drink after buying 10 drinks!conclusioncute and quiet cafe with delicious drinks and super friendly service. i am a fan!
another raving review for a new drinkboba tea spot for the area. i dont think anything bad can be said about this place.this is just going to be a quick little review based on first impressions. upon entry i was immediately greeted by the employees and the clean interior. i knew i wanted milk tea so louis was very helpful to guide me through the whole menu. i chose the hokkaido milk tea and its definitely something i can see myself getting again. semi sweet and sort of nutty? whatever it is, its good! the few things i expected out of this place were met. service was accommodating, product was made quickly, and they stand behind their product making sure you enjoy it 100. will be back fashoooo
this opened up close by my house and i will definitely be going here often. ive been waiting for a good boba place to open in this side of town and brew tea hits the spot. i tried their mango latte with jelly as my first drink and ive never had anything like it. its a cold latte with sea salt foam on top which is unlike anything ive ever tried before! its delicious. ill definitely be back. i also hear they dont use powder in their drinks, is this true yelppers? if so, bless.the workers were extremely friendly and welcoming. they had just ran out of boba and were extremely apologetic and even gave me a free upsize. i felt very comforted in the atmosphere. i got my drink extremely quick as well, and one of the workers even checked up to see if i was satisfied with it. very awesome service!
i will say i feel bad for cefiore closing down but hooray i dont have to drive to chinatown to get good boba drinks. they have the basics i think as it gets busier they will create more flavors but for now the variety they have is enough. they also have great toppings you can put like custard, jelly, taro if you dont like boba. they will also have you try the drink before you leave to make sure you like it. the guys here running the place are cool people too. so far ive tried taro milk tea and their brew milk tea both are fantastic.. i like their boba here they know how to make it.its not hard or chewy very soft and according to them they use honey boba. keep doing what youre doing and youll be good. thanks for the drinks ill be back for sure.
normally i dont write review on yelp but this time i really like to write for brew tea bar because i been there three times and my drink always comes out consistent fresh and good. their oolong and mango is my favorite because the unique sea salt flavor! number one honey boba in vegas! definitely be back again to try all their drinks.
defenitely a top competitor against kung fu tea and tea station, they use longan honey boba just like kung fu tea. so far i have tried the jasmine tea with sea salt cream as the manager recommended and i vouch for that. the second time i visited, i tried to compare their honey green tea with kung fus, about the same but kung fu tea is still better by just a hair. next visit i tried the hokkaido milk tea, not sure how it was supposed to taste like but it was good. my recent visit i wanted to try their brew milk tea. i had one problem here, that it was nothing unique about it. if it had a nick name for their milk tea, it should have been something i have never tried before, besides a regular milk tea. but overall it was good still. my girlfriend tried the mango green tea, a bit sour but it is what to expect from a mango drink. i love the customer service, they always have smiles on their faces and helpful to what you may want. also they ask you if you need any other adjustments in case you dont like it. what really separates kung fu tea and brew tea bar is the loyalty card! finally i can come here non stop and be rewarded a free drink after the 10th purchase! in the end, i would recommend this place to anyone looking for good tea on that side of town.
if you are looking for something refreshing and delicious, this is your one stop shop! ive tried two drinks here and their delicious japanese styled crepe that was filled with nutella and mouthwatering strawberries and bananas. there are other options as well. their drinks are very customizable and if you think its not perfect even after you get it, you can get it adjusted. the service is super friendly and the aura is welcoming. its a clean environment where all the senses are in for a treat though the mesmerizing smell from the freshly made crepes, the refreshing sip from their drinks, to the perfect texture of their boba. im not from the area but anytime im on my way to vegas, im stopping by first to get my boba fix. try the hawaiian paradise. you wont regret it.
they finally opened up a good boba place on the southwest side of vegas! i love taiwanese tea drinks because it is pungent and flavorful. this place reminds me of a place in la called tbay. the staff is friendly and the interior is very simple, which i love. the owner? was gave us a run through of the menu and was very courteous. he gave us a sample of the rose honey tea so that was very sweet of him. all my friends from socal are always talking about hokkaido milk tea and how amazing it is. i decided to give it a try here and it was pretty good! i also tried their honey milk tea which was okay. i dont like honey flavored drinks because i think its too sweet imo. theyre also willing to adjust your drink to your liking. i will be definitely coming here again when i dont feel like driving to chinatown for some boba.
my favorite boba place in las vegas! they have a wide variety of drinks boba, teas, slushes, milk teas, and their japanese style crepes are the best! the owners are really friendly, and they make the best drinks! i love talking to them when i go. ive been going here since they opened a couple weeks ago, and i am so glad i found them! definitely recommended!
so glad this opened up in my side of town! i ordered the mango slush with lychee jelly, and have yet to try the brewed teas... but so far, so delicious! i also got the classic crepe, with nutella banana and strawberry. the service is great  they make sure you like what you ordered and will remake if desired, comparable to kung fu tea. relaxed atmosphere, minimalistic but cute : will definitely come back for more. thanks to you guys, my regular boba runs have become just a few min away!
this is so close to me! i tried the hokkaido milk tea and it is so delish! if u like rose or oolong milk tea then thus flavor will blow your mind! inside it is clean and smells like tea. service is great and prices are decent. i hope they keep up with the quality and service. the boba was fresh and chewy at 1 pm. i hope they will stay open later.....till midnite?
o to the m to the g!!its about time! the ultimate best boba spot in vegas!!!!!i found my favorite boba spot! and it only took me like 20 freakin shops to find this place. they just opened up last month.im super duper excited! and i never say super duper.you want a really good boba spot like southern cali?!! this is the 1 spot!
today i was my first time at the brew teabar , the decor is so simple yet warm and inviting. the staff is extremely friendly, approachable and helpful. i took my mom there for a quick drink, i ordered the oolong latte topped with honey boba  it was so yummy!!!!! i will be back
just tried this place for the first time and was very impressed! the staff were all so nice. i ordered a cocoberry slush and it was delicious. will deff be going back. they even give me free boba to try!
ive tried these so far:oolong latte  i love this so much ive ordered it many times.  this is what works for me: large oolong latte, no ice, 75 sweetness, extra creampeach black tea: bold tea flavor so good which actually prompted me order the black tea latteblack tea latte  did not disappoint!  the sea salt cream with the bold black tea work exactly as i imagined.  went with 100 sweetness in this.hokkaido milk tea  a bit too sweet, but thats what its supposed to taste like.people compare this joint to kung fu tea, i think kung fu tea is a typical taiwanese style fast food boba chain, where as this place actually brews tea! id choose this over kung fu anytime!
great drinks and the staff is super friendly and very informative on their drinks!  they also say they guarantee their drinks if you dont like them!  but no worries,  their drinks are delicious!
i went here with my girlfriend and we fell in love with this place. the atmosphere is quite soothing, perfect to grab a drink and sit down to talk. we got the hawaiian paradise; it was unbelievably refreshing and delicious. most tea places put so much syrup and stuff to make their drinks painfully sweet but you could tell they make everything fresh here and the drinks are just right. we also got a crepe! it was delicious. the service was superb, everyone was really nice and made sure to help you out if you needed adjustments.
greeted right when we walked in!the barista recommended some new drinks and gave us a sample. they dont charge extra for boba!!!when the drinks were finished the barista brought them to us. great customer service. we will be returning.
really awesome place.  my bro in law told me they have the best taro and he was absolutely correct!  customer service was great too.  everyone seemed happy and welcoming.  i will definitely come back.
kung fu? qq boba? tea station? 1 boba? you all can take a back seat now, thanks.i originally visited brew tea bar because i saw some pictures from michael k and antonia r of sea salt tea. sea salt tea? sea salt tea? i havent had a good one since socal! so i must go and try this place! i decided to try their oolong latte, which is their oolong tea with sea salt cream. their oolong had immense flavor yet not bitter. it was brewed just perfectly. whats great is that it is not diabetes in a cup! it had just the right amount of sweetness to it. however, i think they did put a little bit too much cream in it so once i mixed the whole drink together, the cream covered a lot of the oolong taste. another good thing though? if you dont like your drink, they can remake it for you for free. but no, i didnt have them remake it. its unnecessary. next time, i will just request less cream in the drink or just dont mix it at all haha!then last night, i brought some friends with me to try the place. we have also had the pleasure of meeting sous. he knows his stuff and is able to recommend something based on your preferenceswantsdesires. he is very knowledgeable about his products as well. he was the one that recommended the roobios for me since i didnt want something heavy since we had just filled up on dinner. it was also good for digestion! with the five of us all together, we got a hokkaido milk tea, the brew milk tea, jasmine milk tea, jasmine latte sea salt, and a freshly brewed roobios tea. the hokkaido milk tea is sweet and has a very distinct aroma and taste to it. it has a very milky taste. its probably not my cup of tea since it is based off of a creamy candy so it can potentially be very sweet. but it is very good despite that.the brew milk tea is amazing. it is their standard, almost regular milk tea and it is made with high quality. you can definitely taste the tea in their milk tea. the milk and sugar absolutely does not mask it, which is what i love. a majority of milk tea places in vegas make that mistake far too often  by giving you a little bit a tea with a lot of milk and sugar. either that or its really watered down. sure it saves on the costs but it certainly doesnt have my loyalty. the jasmine milk tea is phenomenal. i have been looking for quite some time for an establishment to make jasmine milk tea the correct way  well, to my taste buds anyways. ladies and gentlemen, i have found it. im not even sure how to describe it. it is the place to get jasmine milk tea. the jasmine latte is also very good. just as the jasmine milk tea, the aroma is what wins everyone over. however, you probably shouldnt mix everything all together in the beginning so it doesnt get too milky. the roobios tea. an african tea that gives you the feeling that youre drinking grass jelly with a hint of herbalness at the end. with a tad bit of honey, it is perfect to end the night with. plus, great for digestion! brew tea bar, in my opinion, would be the 1 spot for any tea related cravings. it is possibly the best place in vegas to grab some milk teas. the quality that you get is just simply fantastic. once you walk in, you can see the jars of tea leaves right behind the cashiers. i simply cannot wait to return to try more of their tea based drinks. im also waiting for them to have sea salt coffee on the menu : i am just so happy that i have found a place that i can honestly say that their milk tea is deliciously yummy. and its right next to zee boyfriends house so win win! if you like milk tea then you have got to try brew tea bar. oh they also have a stamp card : buy 10, get 1 so dont forget it!ps: i dont order boba with my drinks so i cant rate their boba.
not sure what youll notice firstthe cool, modern feel of this new tea bar or the excellent customer service! we got a large taro milk tea with half boba and egg pudding you can split toppings with no charge and the jasmine latte with boba. taro milk tea  this is not your overly sweet taro milk tea. it has bits of taro and is very enjoyable because its not crazy sweet! the egg pudding was a great compliment.jasmine latte  again, not overly sweet thank goodness. you can taste the jasmine tea and the sea salt creme...oh my its delicious! it gives the drink a little sweetness and creaminess. they also have stamp cards and take cards!overall, well be back. keep doing your thing guys!
stopped in here on a whim. if you live in vegas, you know that it can be a challenge to find a good boba place that wont break the bank. well this is it. minimalist interior decor with white walls and a few dark colored tables and chairs offer a very clean look. i like the way the iced milk teas are gently blended to just incorporate the iced. the hokkaido milk tea is a bit unique as this iced milk tea is all about the creaminess of the milk and not just the tea flavor. next on my list is a sea salt creme latte!
i absolutely love how this place is not only near my workplace but also near my neighborhood as well. they replaced ce fiore but also take note they have crepes on their menu as well.normally i am a matcha slush fan when i enter a teaboba place but i when i asked sous for a recommendation he said to try the hokkaido milk tea. needless to say theyve got me hooked on it, which is really something because ive only tried it twice at icy juicy and kft but they werent really my favorite. this one however was spot on, wasnt too much diabeetus in a cup for me and had a soft milky aftertaste which i liked. second time i visited i tried it again as well as their coffee milk tea so that i could function for my overnight shift lol. still delivered the same consistency and i am happy with that. my boyfriend ended up trying out their apple green tea which had a distinct taste of apple but wasnt too overpowering. he said he would order it again so thats good! :would definitely come here again! seems to be the new local chill boba spot as there are times i would always end up seeing my friends here haha. i wish they could extend their hours more though like places in chinatown i mean, its vegas so why not? also good for business when they have late night customers lol. ;d
very good quality boba tea! loved the milky slush! nice ambiance and very friendly staff! definitely a new favorite spot and closer to home. cant wait to try their other drinks! will come again.
love this place! amazing customer service and amazing boba tea! the boba is very soft and sweet! would definitely come here a lot more often since its right by my house!
this is my new spot for milk tea. i came in with my sis and niece and brought my lil yorkie, aww unfortunately the employee had to help us outside which was nice of him because no dogs allowed which is understanding. the milk tea i had was delicious. i had the brew milk tea!!! this place also has stamp cards which is nice! definitely going to come back to try something else!
if youve lived on this side of town for years then you know how the new owners left cefiore in shambles compared to what it was. but im so glad brew tea bar replaced cefiore. its honestly the best boba place ive ever been to, and its just so much more convenient to have a good boba place around the corner. ive been here a couple times and i get what ever they recommend for that day. i loved all the drinks i got but my favorite so far is the hokkaido milk tea with boba. its a plus that they dont just have generic fruity flavors in their menu. what impressed me the most was the customer service. ive never really been to a boba place that recommends or tries to find out which drinks you might like, so i was really impressed when the guys, which by the way are just super friendly, talked me through their menu. every time they give me my drink, i love how they kind of stay for a little to see if i like it. the best part is that they are proud to remake your drink if you dont like it. ive been here a couple times and im glad that the staff remembers me because that shows that they do pay attention to their returning customers. overall, i love this place and i 100 recommend it to everyone.
i came here on a early friday morning, which was the same time this tea bar opened. yes, when i say early.. 11a.m. for a night owl is earrrly! :p theyre conveniently located next to blue diamond vapors, in the southwest part of town on s.rainbow blvd, after w. warm springs rd., heading south. its in the same shopping plaza with albertsons. the first time i ever tasted anything with sea salt creme was in california at 85 degrees bakery. im not sure whats in it, but its some heavy duty creme, thats way too sweet and rich for my tummy. dont get me wrong.. i loved the taste, but it was doing a number to my tummy and i, somewhat felt lightheaded. talk about a major sugar rush! their sea salt creme is easy on my digestive system. i dont feel any bloatedness or woozy boozy :i was kindly greeted by sou, who explained the drink menu and specific tea selections i had questioned about. although, i didnt get what he recommended.. i know so pisces of me. i stuck with my favorite.. jasmine tea. i chose jasmine latte, but was given jasmine milk tea by accident. its okay, since i wanted to taste the difference between the two. i also received some boba balls. these marblesized jelly spheres had a delightful, chewy texture. its as fresh as you can get! i prefer without the boba, not because it wasnt good.. i just want to drink my beverage without the paranoia of sucking too many balls down my throat. wait.. that didnt sound right. okay, okay i admit.. im also lazy to chew the boba. i rather sip sip! what?!the jasmine milk tea had more emphasis on the flavor of the tea, which was subtly sweet and highly fragrant. amazing essence of floral jasmine lingered on my tongue. the quality of their tea is superb! they do a great job of making the tea, itself, the focal point of what brew tea bar is all about. down the future, they plan on selling teas in bulk, but for right now, theyre focused on only serving. i was able to sample some of their egg pudding similar to egg custard and freshly, cooked taro. all i have to say is.. clean taste and finish. now to my favorite... jasmine latte. lovely, infused flavors.. not too sweet or salty. so good and refreshing! i was always used to the plastic film sealed on top like on a yogurt container to stab with your straw, hah!!! in order to drink it. i like that part. this tea bar has the regular plastic flat lids, which you just insert your straw in. i highly recommend to mix your sea salt creme before putting your straw in. i was mixing mine all wrong and sou had to correct me with the proper way of mixing the creme. you hold it from the top and twirl the drink with your wrist. ah ha... the struggle was real. i learn something new every single day : thanks sou for the lesson! the tea bar has three picniclike tables with one small round table fitted for two in the back. spacious, yet comfortably compact. ocd clean as a whistle. simple design, with soothing light fixtures. guest service was nothing like i ever received in a boba tea place. informative, helpful, and friendly. i can feel the place has a lot of potential from the dedication of the staff. sou has a extensive amount of knowledge about the teas and the process of making it. i enjoyed his enthusiasm for his joy and passion of tea. dont forget to ask for a stamp card. youll probably end up like me and come back for more! thanks again for the great hospitality and service :
great environment. workers are enthusiastic and willing to go above and beyond to make sure youre satisfied with your tea!
brew tea bar is the only tea bar i will visit when im in vegas!!!  the staff are friendly and the tea is amazing.
my best new boba place in town!! fresh brew teas and fresh taro, yum!! i am coming here from now on...very legit and comparable to boba places in cali.
this places gotta be crowned as king of tea in vegas!!! they have been open for only a month but captured all my friends hearts! we came here 4 times and ordered peach iced tea, jasmine pearl iced ted, lychee peachy iced tea, oolong latte with sea salt cream, caramel milky slush, avacado slush, kiwi iced tea, rosebud iced tea, chrysanthemum iced tea, and a mixed fruit iced tea which was a secret menu item! ask louis! yes, we tried and loved them all! i really loved the aroma of the rosebud. peach iced tea and jasmine pearl are my personal favorite. i have a few suggestions. please create some kumquat, yogurt and plum flavored drinks, and shaved ice. what is more important is that extend the business hours! we need a spot that offers great drinks to hang out at midnight!
finally ! a good tea place ! by good, i mean aromatic, flavorful, genuine tea flavor and not diabetes in a cup good ! took forever for someone to finally create something that fits my preferences ! tea station? the former fresh cup? kung fu tea? sorry : not sorry xd i was told about this place to have sea salt drinks. similar to my favorite coffee and tea at 85c in california that i almost never fail to get every time i visit ! of course, i was excited ! it took over the former cefiore which served generally the same things with crepes. most of the layout stayed the same, as well as crepes were kept. its a bit of a small location, but hey. if you are good like noodle man, etc... who needs a big location? people will naturally be willing to wait ! upon entry, we were greeted by the staff. sou mans the cashier most of the time if not all the time and is super friendly and knowledgeable. goes in depth with the menu and origins of the teas. they have lattes, cold teas, slushes, and fresh brewed teas with high quality tea leaves _ fyi my eyes were sparkling when i saw those glass containers behind the cashier with my favorite teas jasmine pearls, silver needle, iron goddess, oolong... that in itself will make me return endlessly. even before trying their drinks for the first time, ive already determined that ill probably end up trying their entire menu. being a diehard fan of jasmine tea, i had to get the jasmine milk tea first. they have the option of normal sweetness and less sweet. its a habit for me to always try something in its original form ... be it a new recipe, etc. the jasmine milk tea had a wonderful aroma and flavor. one that i have come to love and be one of my favorite teas of all time. not too sweet either. just a nice amount of aromatic flavor thats mellow  xd my friend tried the rooibos tea. i had heard about this tea previously from a friend. african origin. but he didnt tell me much aside from that its good for you. imagine... liquidified grass jelly. xd ! with honey too ! wonder if it would be yummy if you add evaporated milk like the dessert to make a milk tea? o.o curious now i want grass jelly dessert hokkaido milk tea had a sweet but good flavor. quite heavy on the milk flavor but to be expected from hokkaido milk tea i think? sweetest of the 3 teas mentioned so far. on my 2nd visit, i had tried the almond milk tea. the guy making the drink accidentally put boba. offered to remake their drink more on this later but i told him its ok since ive never tried their boba anyway though im not a usual person to order boba. boba itself was nice and chewy. sweet. like honey boba. not soft as mentioned in some other reviews. almond milk tea had a nice flavor. very aromatic with the almond. good for those who like almond. not for those who dont xd wait is that obvious...? lolservice  very nice staff and informative. offer to remake to fit your tastes. i wouldnt say this is a con. each person has different preferences and likings. to offer at their own expense to remake your drink to your liking, id say 1 for them. location  nice ! a good place near 1 of my 3 work locations. hours may be a little on the unfavorable hang out times opens at 11 but closes at 10 but eh its ok. overall. definitely my favorite spot of all time. up to this point, every other place was eh. but i genuinely like this place. if they can keep up the quality. it would be a great asset to the community :d they also offer stamp cards ! buy 10, get 1 free ! yay ! i cant wait till they start offering seasalt coffees though ! they said they havent found a good coffee yet but do plan to have it in the future !
just got the jasmine tea with sea salt cream and this is so amazing! im so glad theres a great boba spot by my house! there was another crepeboba spot here before that wasnt bad but i guess they didnt do very well financially. hopefully this one is here to stay.
stopped in here on a whim. if you live in vegas, you know that it can be a challenge to find a good boba place that wont break the bank. well this is it. minimalist interior decor with white walls and a few dark colored tables and chairs offer a very clean look. i like the way the iced milk teas are gently blended to just incorporate the iced. the hokkaido milk tea is a bit unique as this iced milk tea is all about the creaminess of the milk and not just the tea flavor. next on my list is a sea salt creme latte!
amazing selections of tea and of course you can have it with boba! i ordered the brew milk tea as a starter cz i know im gonna be back for every other flavors! im a teh tarik lovera popular drink from malaysia and the brew milk tea has a quite similar taste. we have that drink at almost every coffee shop in msia. thanks for satisfying my craving! not to mention, they provide great service, you can always switch up for another flavor if you dont like the one your holding! yay for that the only thing is that, i wish they have a more comfortable interior like a cafe, it will be a nice place to study and chill out with friends.
ill start off by saying their service is the best! weve only been twice but both times were so good. no matter what you order, theyll make it exactly how you want it. they dont mind changing your drink for you if you dont like what you ordered. my husband is in love with their boba. probably the best boba hes ever had. they soak it in honey and its delicious!
apparently this place has replaced cefiore. great improvement to what it was! i got the almond milk tea and classic crepe. the boba is chewy like it should be, and the almond flavor is tasty as well! the crepe was great too, and with the service being top notch, it makes the experience even better! ill be seeing this place again.
i went back and got my butt kicked with their iced coffee with sea salt creme. after making my drank.. sou recognized me from my previous visit and said.. oh hi! youre having coffee this late?! its really strong. i told him im going shopping, soooooo i needed my second gust of wind. he said ooooookay and reminded me how to mix my drink with the sea salt creme. i mastered the mixing motion down and was proud to show him my twirl. see.. see.. thinking i could handle this drink, i, fearlessly gulped half of it down before leaving the lot. it was that good. im not much of a heavy coffee drinker, but the bitterness out shined the sea salt creme.. ending with hints of caramel. there was a pleasant balance between the strong coffee flavor and the sweetness of the creme. silly me was bold to ask for a large size! i felt my veins being fueled with caffeine as i drank away. i shouldve listened to sou. i felt like i took one of those dangerous fat burner pills way back in the days. it gave me this jolt.. so extreme that my heart couldnt even keep up with its beat. my eyes were wide open. i was spasming out. i tried to calm my loony self by going to a bookstore, but my eyes were in a frenzy, they couldnt keep still in reading a page! after it was all absorbed and done.. i felt eminently exhausted. holy caffeine high!!! ill never do that again :p so be forewarned.. this iced coffee will kick your a. deliciously!
qualitea from the best bobaristas in town. haha! that was really cheesy. seriously, i cant feel my face when im with you, but i love it. this place is crack...literally. when im not here im thinking about my next fix. i secretly have a paper menu at home that i mark which drinks i want to try and which ones ive had. one could mistaken it for a hit list if you will. what a perfect combination of great customer service and delicious drinks. from my experience, other similar establishments have little to no customer service whatsoever. at brew tea, their customer service really shines. sou, dennis, and louis are extremely knowledgeable about their products and will do their best to help you find a drink youll like. they really go the extra mile here to make sure youre satisfied with your drink. if you dont love your drink, they will make you something else. dont be shy and dont feel bad. they can tell if you dont like it! even if they are busy, they still do their rounds to see if you like your drink. they also insist those taking their drinks togo to taste it before they leave. drinks tried: slush: taro slush  the best in town. they use real taro along with the purple, artificial powder stuff we all know and love. this drink is really balanced and not too sweet! cocoberry  basically, a miami vice minus the rum. too sweet, but if coconut and strawberry are your thing. go for it. adjust the sweetness and this might be someones perfect poolside drink. milk tea: taro  you can taste the real bits of taro! same great balanced taste like the slush. i prefer the slush because i like the thicker consistency for my taro drinks. okinawa  a brown sugar based milk tea. some of their drinks can be on the sweeter side. i originally ordered this less sweet, which i instantly regretted. i had this one remade to be 5 of 5 sweetness level and loved it! caramel  perfectly, sweet. added egg pudding as a topping. great combo. i think that the caramel milky slush with egg pudding would be a great combo as well.latte: side note: their lattes are topped with sea salt foam. the salt is really delicate and not salty at all. it enhances the flavors of the drink, especially the sweetness. my two cents, taste your drink before you mix it all up!! some drinks may taste better if you let the foam seep in as you drink. even a light mix is good. i stare when people shake up their drinks aggressively. its like dude, did you taste it yet? whatevs, to each their own. anyways, i find if you play it safe you can achieve a different experience with each sip.black tea  black tea lovers will love this one. this is a winner in my hubbys book. oolong  we opted for the roasted version, which gave it a nice smoky taste. our taste buds will stick with the black tea latte or the cold brew coffee. mango  this one is a skip. it is one of the sweeter drinks. mango is sweet and the sea salt makes it sweeter. if you love mango, adjust the sweetness level on this accordingly. cold brew coffee  best. drink. ever. the coffee is strong, smooth, and balanced. no harsh, acidic coffee here. i enjoyed this in three phases. first couple sips, i drank the coffee and left the sea salt foam alone. amazing. second phase, i mixed some sea salt foam in it. wow. the sweetness of the coffee was elevated. last phase, of course is when it is a yummy, homogenous concoction! too bad this place is out of my way. i would love this before every brutal 12 hour night shift! last but not least, lets talk balls. you know the dark, chewy stuff some of you like to sip on. the boba or tapioca pearls at brew tea are of the honey variety, which means they are sweet. not sure how i feel about the honey boba here. right now, i think it is due to inconsistency. honestly, most of the time i order drinks without boba. there is a place in town that i have a lovehate relationship with. kft has the best boba balls in town, but i really dislike their drinks and customer service. ha! i said it. must try their iced teas and herbal teas next! suggestion: seating! currently, there are 3 tables that seat 4 each and a bench for people to wait for their drink. when it is busy, smaller parties dont have a place to hang out. any possibility to add a bar top counter to the wall up front with some cool bar stools? i know, im reaching here...
this place is 5 stars because of the overall product, customer service, and ambience. louis, sou, and dennis are always so kind and truly care about their customers. ive never tried anything there that i dont like but im super picky with the textures of my drinks if that makes sense. my first visit i tried the jasmine milk tea which i loved. i feel milk teas are usually more heavy filling than things such as teas and i hadnt eaten anything that day so i was okay with the heavyness of the milk tea. the second time i came i ordered the matcha milk tea which dont get me wrong was delicious but i could not bring myself to finish it all because of how heavy filling milk teas are after a meal. i was so afraid to ask them if i can change it to the passion fruit green tea and kept telling my friends to change it for me because i was embarrassed lol. louis was so kind and funny and changed it with no problem. im so glad this is the closest boba spot near my house and is one of my favorites. will always come back when im in the mood for some boba! thank you guys!! :
my first review! this place is too amazing to not say anything. great customer service. their drinks are guaranteed. they make it as sweet as you like! and the tea: amaaazing. you taste each tea profile with every drink. i am very impressed. the tea lattes have sea salt cream, which is absolutely amazing. oolong latte, jasmine latte, okinawa milk tea are my faves. : mango slush and honey milk tea are bomb as well! seriously so excited that this place exists! its hard to not go every day. lol next on my list is to try the coffee with sea salt! i hear its also amazing. :
with the oolong, chrysanthemum, and rose milk teas that have been popular, a girl sometimes just wants a nice, simple cup of black milk tea. up until now, there wasnt a convenient place to grab one in vegas, but thanks to brew tea, now there is! im not sure if i can call brew tea bar the best boba place in vegas, but i think its safe to call it the best tea bar in vegas! their drinks are top qualitea! ive only had the milk tea and brown sugar milk tea, and both were perfect. their tea was strong but not overpowering and still complemented the milk and sugar for an amazing overall taste! the boba is also usually soft, chewy, and sweet, but i have had friends complain that it was sometimes too hard to chew. the service is great. theyre very good about remaking your drink if its not to your liking, which i havent needed so far.
my new favorite boba place! and im sooo happy they are in the southwest area  5 mins away from my house! i ordered jasmine milk tea half sugar and my friend ordered okinawa milk tea half sugar as well.  both were very good and tasty and just the right amount of sweetness. the guy at the counter asked if i wanted boba and i said no, however, he said their boba is different so he put a little bit in my drink with no additional  charge! awesome service. however, i didnt really notice the difference between their boba and boba at other places. they have a stamp card which is great for repeat visits. their prices are very reasonable. regular is 3.50 and large is 4.50 for the milk teasi definitely recommend this place and i know ill be a regular customer :
i like when people post pictures of their menu because i like to see what they offer and prices, so ill do the same. i have been to this place for a couple times now. their drinks are consistent and doesnt have a weird milk taste like kung fu tea, probably because they use lactosefree milk. if you dont like your drink theyll happily take it back and make it according to your taste. however, their boba is sometimes too chewy but it doesnt seem to bother me.they have a secret menu, but only has one item which is a cold brew coffee topped with their sea salt cream. there is no bitter taste after you drink it and the cream adds a new flavor to the original coffee.
i love the vibe i get here. the people are so nice and sweet. their drinks are very good they dont make it that sweet which i like but you can adjust the sweetness level. if you dont like their drink, theyll make you a new one guaranteed!
i got the caramel milk tea  boba and it was really really good! and customer service was great, theyre super nice and friendly! im definitely going back to try more drinks :
delicious tea, clean shop, friendly staff, good prices and quick service.  i couldnt ask anything more from this shop. i will be back for sure. ive been looking for a place with good almond milk tea, finally found one after 4 years since i moved out to vegas from la. this place is comparable to milk teas in alhambra, ca. 5 stars 
came here the other day after waiting and waiting for sephoria to open back up and finally this was open! this place is very nicely decorated and feels very cozy and is made to feel even more so by the service we got there. younger asian gentleman who i think may have been the owner was extremely nice and explained new additions to the menu and what had changed and told us about the money back garuntee which even though i would never use it was a really great gesture. so i ended up getting the hokkaido milk tea which was a first time for me. the taste was really reminiscent of honey and milk and the boba was really good. my gf got the pistachio slush but wasnt really happy with the consistency not being like a smoothie which she knew was because it was a slush but it isnt listed as being offered as a smoothie i was super happy with my drink and the service i got and it was probably some of the best actual boba ive ever had will definitely come back.
now that im thoroughly addicted to btb, they definitely deserve a 5 star rating.  if there were a 6th star, theyd get it.the customer service is simply amazing, not to mention the product.  i just love the sea salt tea lattes and the only two i have yet to try are the black tea and the strawberry.  there are still so many items that i havent had yet, but i will.  the pb crepe is a delicious dessert that ive had the chance to eat with friends.  we love this spot and will continue to be frequent fliers with sou and his crew serving up some really quality stuff in the southwest.
brewtea is currently my favorite boba place at the moment i would like to compare this place to kung fu since they do the sweet adjustment thingy but kung fu keeps turning me down lately. great customer servicegreat bobaeverything is awesome
perfectly cooked boba and flavorful slush. they mix whatever flavors you want and use fresh fruit. best part is if you dont like your drink, theyll replace it for free.
this place looks so nice place to chill with friends! people working here were pretty nice too, the server explained me the stuff about the drinks. i ordered the matcha milk tea and dang, that was so good. the boba is really fresh and very chewy, this is so different from any bobas that i had before!
drove about 25 minutes to try this place out. one of the best boba cafe ive been to with great customer service. they remembered my order i dont even remember what the milk tea was called and checked up on me to see if i liked my drink and crepe. they even took the plate from me when i was finished. definitely had to tip and leave a good review.
close by home and the first time trying a new flavor and i didnt dislike it . the atmosphere inside is nice . the coworkers are friendly and before the drink is even made they inform you that if you are not satisfied with the drink they will remake of. i tried the okinawa tea and was a surprise of how it tasted. not to sweet, but a perfect combination of black tea and brown sugar . i would think that sounds gross , but when i tried it i was satisfied
there cant be good living where there is not good drinking.  benjamin franklinsea salt cream!...honey boba!...cold brew coffee if you arrive early enough to try some!...milk teas  tea lattes made with excellent quality teas!...fresh, real ingredients like real taro!...egg custard pudding to add to your beverage... brew tea bar goes above and beyond most spots in town. the reasons are plentiful to believe the hype. you can knock their seating or their line, but simply put, brew tea bar is the best in town for tea lattes, milk teas, and boba in general.its a menu worth exploring. i would confidently order from any section and anticipate enjoying a good drink, but if youre looking for a place to start check out one of the following:oolong latte w sea salt cream i prefer the smokier variety of oolonghokkaido milk tea shout out to my buddy ethan for turning me on to this one!trio slush if youre in the mood for dessert taro milk tea made with ample pieces of fresh tarosilver needle w lychee if you prefer an elegant and subtle tease of light, delicate flavors on your tongue their customer service is excellent throughout the ordering process and after as well. like other good establishments, brew tea bar is willing to remake it for you to get it exactly how you like it less ice, less sweet for me.they are easily the best in town for milk teas and tea lattes. if youre all about the fresh fruit smoothieslush you may still want to make a trip to 1 boba or qq. i usually dont understand the eruption of 5 star reviews that seems to accompany so many places the last couple of years, but at brew tea bar it is entirely earned.
cold brew coffee and all of their milk boba especially their specialty ones are so bomb.
amaze balls !!!! taro slush was the best i have had by far. cute little cafe that offers new and delicious flavored drinks. prices are reasonable and service was exceptional. stop by if youre in the area :
o to the m to the g!! its about time! the ultimate 1 boba spot in vegas!!!!!i found my favorite boba spot! and it only took me like 20 freakin shops to find this place. they just opened up 2 months ago.  im super duper excited! and i never say super duper.you want a really good boba spot like southern cali?!! this is the best!all of their drinks have been on point. they definitely nailed it! the jasmine latte and the coffee latte with sea salt cream makes me smile every time.  who knew these flavors marry so well? all perfect for this hot vegas weather.taro slush, honeydew, hokkaido, oolong honeydew, mango slush, sunset on the beach, oolong latte... all the flavors have been very pleasant. i go here quite a lot.the boba is timed, fresh, and made to perfection. they throw out their unused boba and only serve fresh. their boba is sweet, soft, and chewy, just like it should be! if you want hard, stale, old boba then go somewhere else because you obviously dont know what boba is. the egg pudding is just right. its soft, sweet, and holds its consistency. the flavor is definitely there!  other boba tea shops try to make it but failed. other boba tea shops in vegas make it too liquidly bland where the pudding breaks apart and dissolves into the drink. thats just not right at all.have you tried their crepes? loovvveee it!!! seriously check this place out!
high quality teas! service is great and would definitely recommend the place! best boba ive ever had :
i went for the first time yesterday and i already want to go back! finally, a boba place in las vegas that rivals tpumps in the bay area. brew tea bar seems to have lifted the bad customer service curse that plagued cefiore previously at this location. although this place is busy, the staff manages the line well and still does a thorough job informing customers of their offerings. my husband went with the taro milk tea with honey boba. he enjoyed it, particularly because it didnt have that artificial flavor you get at most places. i had the peach green iced tea, with no added sweetness. the owner helped me decide on no added sweetness by asking me if i liked the taste of tea to really come through in my drinks. my drink came out just the way i wanted it and helped provide some relief on the hot vegas day. i cant wait to try out their crepes and other drinks! thoughtfulness and a quality product go a long way with me, so theyve earned themselves a loyal customer. glad i got a stamp card from them and wouldnt be surprised if i end up filling it before the end of this month.
so happy to have found a boba tea place here in the sw!! i am pretty picky about boba teas and this place is awesome!! they customize the sweetness level and thats what love about them because it does not over power the tea flavors. check it out! now! ive had matcha slush boba, okinawan, hokkaido, and taro milk tea bobas. so good!!
ive tried numerous boba places in vegas and brew tea is definitely my number one place so far. the first time i came here i ordered the oolong latte with the sea salt cream. i highly recommend this if youre indecisive about what to get! i tried it iced and hot. i personally like it hot, but both are worth trying. the prices are very reasonable ranging from about 36 depending on what you put inside your drink. the customer service is beyond fantastic! all of the workers are friendly and outgoing. also, if you dont like your drink they will make you a new one without an issue.
the cousins originally from hawaii suggested we try brew tea bar to satisfy our boba tea craving. with very friendly workers, it made the drive from the strip worth it.we ordered the brew milk tea, and sea salt latte in milk and black.
my new addiction!! amazing customer service, the boys are so nice. the sea salt cream lattes and taro tea here are my favorites.  i am so happy the best boba spot in vegas opened by my house.
my favorite spot ever!!! i recommend this place to everyone looking for a good boba spot. they have great tea, great boba, and great service!!! im so in love!
very clean place. love the drink here. this is a little busy place. the staff are very nice and helpful. they have super yummy crepe. the drinks are good quality not cheap stuff.
best. boba. ever. customer service is great and their boba gets better!problem i typically have is that either the drinks too sweet or the boba is too sweet and hard. this place is great.the very first time i came here, they told me to make sure my drink was 100 to my satisfaction. it was a bit on the sweet side for me but they happily fixed it for me. id have to say the boba was too hard the first time, but after the next few times ive gone their boba just gets better and better. i have yet to try everything but everything i have tried has been great!dont need to make my way to chinatown anymore to get my boba cravings yeeee!
the new hang out spot for the sw side of town! place was packed when we came in and the owner introduced himself and recommended us drinks off the menu. he told us about the business and his experience. i was with my cousin and we ordered the mango green tea and the lychee peachy green tea which he said was his favorite. the drinks came out fast and we thought it was great! the boba is fresh and comparable to kung fu teas boba, which is soft and sweet. the owner also told us that we could change the flavor until we were satisfied, the service was amazing.the only thing that disappointed us was the fact that it was so packed and there was no where to sit, barely any tables outside either. other than that, it was totally worth the drive to this side of town.
finally, a good boba place near my house! i have only tried three drinks so far, but all have been really good! first i got oolong latte, which was really good. the second time i went i got the caramel milk slush which was so yummy! i mixed it,which made it not too sweet for me. the caramel milk slush at tea station is way too sweet for me, so i was excited about brew tea bar making theirs more subtle. the third time i went i tried the hokkaido milk tea, which made me hooked. ive been ordering that since then. its a good thing i found my favorite, but it prevents me from trying more drinks on the menu. haha! the flavors of the drinks are always on point, and the boba is always cooked perfectly.besides the drinks, i havent tried the food yet. the place is always spotless clean, they have cute wooden tables and chairs, and their customer service is excellent. i have been debating if kung fu tea or brew tea bar is better because the quality of their drinks are about the same. i think brew tea bar wins by a small margin just because its down the street from my house and i always get great customer service here. kung fu tea has messed up my order a few times in the past and is in a busy area. brew tea bar is a definite must try!!
5 stars!!! woohoo!!! as good as it gets!!!!just amazzzzing staff and drinks. i come here almost every week maybe even twice on the same day my wife and i usually get the same thing which is hokkiado milk tea for me and for her, she gets okinawa milk tea. but occasionally well get something new. but no matter what you get you wont get disappointed. because...taste guaranteed!! once you get your drink, they will ask you to take sip, and if you dont like it. they make it again or a new drink for you. you cant beat that!!!
this place is amazing! the quality of the tea is fantastic, the taro is fresh, the boba is good. sou has a really great business in his shop, is super friendly and knowledgable, and i hope to see him expand! the quality is so much better than lollicup, and much cheaper. if you want boba or milk tea in the valley, this place is it. only downside is that im in henderson, but i always stop by when i have appointments on the west side of town ;
chill boba spot in the sw area. i just started going here and my experiences each visit were great. you are greeted with a nice, loud welcome when you enter inside. workers are very polite and recommend you let them know if you need any changes after theyve given your drink just in case you werent fully satisfied.i usually get the black tea latte with less sugar topped with boba. the latte has a sea salt creamer which makes it taste delicious. it might sound weird to get, but its the perfect balance of sweet and salty and i would definitely recommend you try it!
what more can you ask for when a boba place has delicious drinks and exceptional customer service? brew tea bar has become one of my goto spots for when im craving some boba. its close to my house and serves my favorite milk tea flavor, rose. the rose milk tea is phenomenal and definitely tastes even better with their honey boba. a specialty that brew tea bar serves is the milk tea latte: a tea of your choice as the base infused with sea salt creamer. it might sound a whole lot of weirdness at first, but give it a try! i personally loved the black tea latte. ive also tried their passion fruit green tea with less sugar and hokkaido milk tea which were both good. they ensure that you are satisfied with your drink before you leave their place, or they will gladly replace you with another drink. they also allow you to select your sugar level and provide great recommendations whenever youre stuck on what to order. i will continue on my visit to brew tea bar, keep up the great work!
talk about hot new business yelp style. not often get into the whole boba drinks but every once in while get my boba on. brew tea bar forget the boba not literal sense because every time stopped by added boba truly about the teas. boba balls are by itself the bomb. i love that not only generous with the amount but the texture and flavor of the boba. tea not something i normally drink more of espresso or sugar coffee drinks get at starbucks. brew tea bar opened my eyes to another world and really the best part is lot more refreshing then coffee. the endless amount of flavors that can choose from besides you can come up with your own combination. the styles from the milk teas, my favorite the sea salt creme not idea what it is but all i know is creme layer on top, and once stir around makes the world go around in perfect tea harmony, or slush. think missing one other style. as you can imagine am sure there is something for everyone. the guys are extremely knowledgeable about the tea they serve very impressed. they can even break down history lesson if you want. my first visit tried the mango sea salt creme. i mention earlier talk about refreshing drink! it not only had the right amount of mango flavor but add the creme it was divine. i associated more like thai ice tea with the creme but at whole another level cause mango much more refreshing and more addicting. if you like sweet drink any of the sea salt creme only way. my second visit tried the berry lovers crepe. talk about all giddy for crepes. i went with my roommates for desserts after dinner. my roommate was telling me never seen me more excited about food. it been long time recall having good crepe. the pictures saw on yelp looked amazing. i watching the gentlemen put together the crepe fresh, every step putting on the fresh fruit, whip cream, nutella, and then the kicker green tea ice cream. it really was seeing artist painting his mona lisa. truly looked that good had no idea the best way to attack it. i was in awe of it. the flavors was unreal good. the combination of nutella and green tea ice cream. never thought of or think would be that addicting. it was beyond addicting was the perfect marriage of flavors. all the fresh fruit the strawberries, blueberries, and think bananas. no bruises on any of the fruit, all looked hell of fresh, and each one tasted sweet. the green tea ice cream you would have to add on. the green tea ice cream is by far the best green tea ice cream ever had in life. i asked them if could order scoop of it by itself the next time. it super expensive stuff they could not afford sell it by the scoop. i can understand why cause the depth of the ice cream unreal. never had one that strong of green tea flavor but yet perfect balance nice creamy and still taste like ice cream. the portion size if great. my roommates shared one while i eat whole one myself. i made room for dessert. lol. i also ordered the taro slush with boba wash it all down. the scoop of fresh taro on top really nice touch and tasted awesome. i love the color of the taro in drinks and the taro slush not only looked the part but tasted the part. if looking for filling drink the taro slush is the way to go. between the crepe and taro slush. i could barely stand up for all the fooddrink., my third visit tried the coconut milk tea. talk about haupia! it was the perfect liquid haupia drink. so so so refreshing. only draw back is the place is small so when it gets crowded no place sit down. the decor is pretty plain outside of the cool brew tea bar sign. i enjoy the asian style tables. the way they display all the base teas in glass jars. the fact that can see them make the crepes. cool. it perfect entertainment for the kids. the whole staff at brew tea bar is super friendly, know their tea, and by the second visit all within same week the guy remembered my name. they have stamp card program ten stamps the next one free. brew tea bar is great place go anytime of the day just chill with friends.
they are friendly and good service. my favorite drink is hokkaido milk tea with half lychee and boba. it is so goooooooood. best drink place in southwest region.
maybe its the all the gleaming white teeth smiles every customer receives from the men running the counter, or their clean asian male haircuts, or the fact that each guys name is on the back of their shirt...i think boy band.  seriously, if they all wore wireless headset mics, you wouldnt even question it.  theyre the backstreet boys of tea!  bsbbtb.  their hit singles just happen to come in plastic cups by the hundreds.  tell me whyee!i want it that wayif the drink isnt to your satisfaction, theyll keep remaking it until it is.  too sweet, too bitter, or if you just flat out dont like it, take advantage of this offer and get something else.  as long as you love meall they want are happy customers, and if youre not, i pretty much pin that on you and not them.  unless you expected the boys to break out into a song with amazing harmonies and they didnt...then its definitely them.  all i have to givewith multiple visits in less than a month due to my wifes current relapse into boba addiction, i am ready to commit to a prepaid card.  we keep a takeout menu in my car as a checklist to remember what we havent tried yet for chrissakes.  take my !!!!
brew tea bar had real taro in the taro slush! their drinks are delicious and parking is plentiful, making brew tea bar a strong southwest competitor to the boba shops in chinatown.  the only down side of brew is the store size  there were only 5 tables, so seating is highly limited.
my favorite boba spot in the southwest area since its super close to my house! the boba is always sweet and chewy, the perfect texture. the workers are always so nice and have very good customer service. they have a policy that if you do not like your drink they will adjust it for you or you can get something new. my favorite drinks to get are usually the hokkaido milk tea with boba or the caramel milky slush!
i love this place! theres a ton of boba places in las vegas, but brew tea really is one of my most favorite locations. the staff is super nice and service is good. i recommend getting the hokkaido milk tea and the rose milk tea, theyre amazing!! its a great place to chill after school and on the weekends
very friendly and knowledgeable staff, they even replace one drink that one of our family didnt like it. they use a very high quality loose leaf tea and the boba taste chewy and soft not hard. ill definitely be back
new hot spot for boba tea!their avocado boba is awsome!my wife loves their brew milk tea.
i come here on a weekly basis now. the best boba you can ever get compared to other places in las vegas. small cool place to hang out with your friends and converse. i usually get the hokkaido milk tea or the coffee milk tea but everything on the menu is great as f. the boba is literally lava and its nice and chewy. the also have crepes that are also great as well. everything from the drinks, to the staff are just great and nice. i recommend this place to all my homies every time. i honestly think ive become addicted to this place.
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas.finally legit boba in vegas. its been so long since ive had good boba in this town that ive pretty much filed it as a lost cause. boba seemed like a faint memory, something i would just get while on vacation back home home in the bay or in la. i stopped thinking about boba as part of my daily life. heartbreaking i know. brew tea has reawakened my love, making me feel things about boba i havent felt in years lol. 1. sea salt cream  about time this became a boba shop staple. put that ish on everything. 2. honey boba  perfect consistency and sweetness, pleasantly bouncy3. milk tea  from hokkaido to okinawa to regular milk tea, theyre all rich in tea flavor.currently addicted to the cold brew coffee with sea salt cream. yas. p.s. decor could be a little better. shh.
the chrysanthemum tea was not only pretty but was sooo cool  refreshing. the staff were all so professionally friendly  informative. their menu had so many that i wanted to try! so being this was my first time here, i had to try 2!  lol my 2nd was the caramel milk tea! me being a caramel lover, it was perfect.  i must add that they told me that the chrysanthemum tea is like a cooling tea? well, like i said it was cool  refreshing! they aim to please! and if it wasnt to my liking, they would b more than happy to make it to your liking! no problem! for sure i will be a returning customer! thank u smooches
nice little spot to grab a drink! coffee  tea etc.. keep it simple.. best way to go! must try black tea with sea salt creme! note to owner try to add: honey toast to the menu! it will be a good add! stop by and show some love!!
so far so good!  staff are very welcoming n menu is very simple to understand and order
if you build it they will come. im sure brew tea bar can attest to the truth of that statement. they built a quality product in a city overrun by syrup, powders, and low quality tea. now their little shop in the southwest area is jam packed with customers after only being open for 2 months. word spreads quick when youre good and as friendlyhelpful as their crew is. i like the simplicity of the shop because the focus is the product. the fresh brew are my favorite because theyre brewed in a tea infuser and bring out a lot of the aromatics! i started becoming so addicted to the fresh teas that i bought my own infuser so i wouldnt be broke ha. other than the fresh brew my side chick is their cold brew coffee with the latte foam. i only wish they opened earlier so i could come by in the morning to live through another treacherous work day. fortunately the only drink i did not like was their hokkaido milk tea, tasted too much like only sweetened milk sorry guys! and their boba chewiness is sometimes too sweet for my preference. tl;drtoday i didnt even have to use my aki cant believe today was a good day cause i had brew tea bar
even though theyre still new on the block, they are still defending their title with little effort. yes, i have decided that brew tea bar is officially the 1 spot for milk teas and flavored teas. the number one. take it in, think about it, and dont argue with me. after my initial review, i have returned to brew tea bar a few more times to try a few more things. they now have sea salt coffee. they have sea salt coffee. and you know what? its pretty damn good and its also pretty damned strong. need a lift? oh, this will give you a lift. this will give you more than a lift. this would get you jumping! their coffee is strong yet not bitter or acidic and it is beyond smooth. its delicious! whenever i drink their sea salt coffee, i feel as though ive drank a red bull. it gives me wings. its just unfortunate that they dont open that early so i cant get it before work... booooo haha! i have also requested a strawberry green tea. they dont have it on the menu but they definitely have the ingredients to make it. most places make their flavored ice teas quite sweet so i had them add notes: more tea flavor and less sweet. i believe there was a miscommunication for my order so when i got it and tasted it, i wasnt really sure what i was drinking. it tasted quite weird. no tea flavor and no fruit flavor. however, they remade it, got it right, and it was perfect  wasnt too sweet with immense jasmine tea flavor. it was perfection in a cup. brew tea bar also doesnt back down from a challenge or any difficult customization that you have in mind. strawberry milk tea. people dont drink it for the tea, people drink it for the sweetness! well, ill be darned. but its okay. sou was up for a challenge so he gave it a go. i needed it less sweet with a noticeable tea flavor to go along with it and he was definitely able to complete this challenge. tons of tea, strawberry, and no added sugar. done. a little tangy due to the strawberries with tea flavor. yup. done. im good. i am typically afraid to order fruit based milk teas in other places because: if i dont like their regular milk tea, im probably not going to like any other milk teas that they have. but its okay, brew tea bar has got you. go to brew tea bar. just go.
perfection. if they dont get it right the first time theyre more than happy to try again. great customer service and prices. love love love!
aw man ran out of space on the other review to keep updating but since this place is soooo good ! a new one they will get ! lol or rather an update i guess? went out of town and was busy after coming back so been on a 2 12 week hiatus from coming here. upon entry... lol they still remember my name xd why me d: lol so this time around, i got to try the rose milk tea. less sweet, more tea flavor requested ! just like how i like it ! their milk tea base is already good, now with rose added to it. its just as youd imagine how rose would taste like from its smell. hard to describe for me xd my friend requested a custom drink for herself. strawberry milk tea. strawberry isnt a fruit that would come out so well and easily done when mixed with milk tea. either youd get it diabetes style with tons of sugar and powder and what not yep a lot of people do this or youd mix with a syrupjam or even fresh fruit. to be honest, i forgot what he did but as their way of style goes, theyll keep remaking it until you like it. 1st one was more sour. true to a fresh strawberry taste breaking through the milk tea taste but as requested, less sweet. pretty good. has a nice strawberry flavor with its unique sourness but not masking the tea flavor either. he came around with a 2nd one for us to try. i guess he was experimenting with what he had. he tried to make it less sour with a stronger tea flavor. yeah indeed he did that but we thought the 1st one was more strawberry characteristiclike xd
after my multiple return visits, ive reached an increasingly obvious conclusion: brew tea bar is the best milk tea  boba establishment in town.i finally made my second visit last week on a weekday evening. they had an astonishing four people working at the time, which the subsequent dinner rush proved necessary. i chose the hokkaido milk tea default sugar level with egg pudding after my friend mentioned enjoying this drink albeit with boba too. the drink was a sweet treat with a flavor thats often described as caramel and toffee. the egg pudding was a silky custard that took on a lot of the teas flavor. it had a great complementary texture as well, and its one of the best egg pudding addons that ive had. ill probably shy away from the hokkaido unless im feeling especially desserty, but i see why others like it.my third visit was after sunday night dinner at a nearby restaurant. i finally went for the jasmine latte. it comes with sea salt cream, as all their latte drinks do. i didnt write about sea salt cream much in my initial review, but it was a difference maker here. it added a subtle but noticeable counterpoint to the subtle sweetness and the strong tea flavor. jasmine milk tea is one of my favorites because the jasmine flavor is one of the ones that isnt masked as milk tea, and its presence lingered in every sip even after the ice melted. as a combination of a classic flavor in jasmine and a less common accent in sea salt cream, this marriage is my favorite drink here up to this point.todays visit cemented my decision to add a fifth star. i decided not to get a latte again, instead selecting the brew milk tea with honey boba. any namesake item should be great, and this drink really is. the overall flavor is somehow richer than a typical standard milk tea as opposed to insert any word here milk tea and the sweetness is balanced as ive come to expect here. a standard milk tea at these kinds of shops is sweet, but the brew has a relatively restrained sugar level by default.i also now consider the honey boba here the best in town as well. not only did they demonstrate consistency in the texture, but this also was the first time ive tasted a honey boba and actually associated the flavor with honey, perhaps due to the great drink that it accompanied. one last but important note is that they were happy to fulfill my request of adding less ice than usual, and that gave me a sense of higher value and less watering down toward the end of the drink.with excellent teas and toppings, plus the safety net of their satisfaction guaranteed policy, brew tea bar is almost certainly the best of its genre that vegas ever has been blessed with. its even comparable to the top places in california, so both locals and visitors alike should go out of their way if theyre fans of these types of drinks. if a taxi ride is necessary, im sure theres other places nearby that would help justify the expense.update 9515: been back a few times. earl grey latte has a rather special flavor, one which real earl grey tea enthusiasts are aware of, im sure. i wasnt, so this seemed just a little strange to me. i prefer my jasmine latte, as well as the oolong latte that i tried tonight. they have a smoky oolong, which is a black tea, and a high mountain oolong, which is a green tea. i ordered the latter and enjoyed the lighter taste, although i still prefer the jasmine.i also tried a passion fruit green tea recently, which came too sweet and forced me to use their awesome customer satisfaction policy to lighten the sweetness while strengthening the tea flavor. the result was good, but not as good as their lattes. and speaking of that policy, somehow an okinawa milk tea w boba was added to my order tonight. they refunded it entirely, no problems, multiple apologies. im not sure how that happened, but i was glad not to be stuck with the calories.
great spot in the sw for boba!  there drinks are consistently good and the staff is super friendly!
uh yes..l would like more boba please. i am addicted to boba....i think it was my one craving being pregnant. in fact my husband would make it a point to get boba milk tea on the way home once or twice a week after work. it is amazing that i am not sick of it. so my friend asked me what i wanted  because she wanted to visit the baby and i told her boba. she brought me some boba from boba tea bar and that was that. actually theres more to that story but the short version is that i told her i wanted the brew milk tea if the tea wasnt so strong flavored and if not i would like the honey milk tea. she asked the guy and they said the brew tea wasnt strong at all so she ordered it for me. by the time she brought it over to my place a good 1015 minutes the boba was still warm and soft and the drink was delish. my husband got the coffee with sea salt foam or whatever and he said it was good a.though he couldnt taste the sea salt? overall, i think it was delish and ill be making the trek down myself one of these days.
i think i might have found my new fave boba place! and i like that its just around the corner from my house! staff is very very friendly the milk teas are excellent and they will adjust the flavor if need be! crepe is really good too! will definitely be a regular
i love the taro slush with boba. it tastes so fresh. the place inside was so clean.  ill be back here again soon the prices are reasonable. all the staff seemed so friendly. this saves me a trip to china town when i  need my boba tea fix.
the rose milk tea is awesome here. must try!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this place is awesome! delicious thai milk tea and honeydew boba! the service is fast and on point! first time there and they called me by name when my order was ready and they never asked for it to begin with  they must have remembered my name from my debit transaction.
thank you brew tea!! thank you for bringing good bubble tea and smoothies to this side of town!! and to boost, this place has top notch service. too bitter? not sweet enough? no problem. the lovely servers here will make another one for you at no cost. my favorite thing on their menu is probably their fresh brewed teas. i love strong teas.. i love the smell and the taste of the teas. i add a hint of honey for sweetness and bam! deliciousness in a cup. i live on this side of town and i dont want to mention any other teacoffeesmoothie places around here but brew tea beats every other place around the area in product and service. drop by and quench your thirst. i can guarantee youll love it.
this is handsdown my favorite teahouse in vegas. i always need some tea or boba when i come to vegas and i would usually just go to the nearest place. now ive found my goto teahouse! ive tried the matcha milk tea, taro milk tea and a classic crepe. they were all delicious. the matcha milk tea was rich and flavorful, and not too sweet. the taro milk tea tasted like real taro. and the classic crepe was fresh and yummy. the customer service was exceptional and attentive even though they were busy. they were so friendly and helpful. five stars to the best teahouse in vegas haha if youre a local or not, its definitely worth coming to try.
of course i had to try this place, its a brew bar  and im a mama coffee addict. its a cute place tucked away in an albertsons shopping center. upon arrival, it reminded me of the boba place in spring mountain. its nice that a place like this exist closer to home. i was in and out  but the items they use is real and its posted on their wall. its also nice they have multiple people working, and nice people too. its not your typical one person, half aing their customer service. i was in a hurry, obviously had to try the cold brew coffee with the sea salt cream. let me tell you, that was strong a coffee and thats how i like it lol. their simple but cute decor is nice, and they have a stamp card system. i will definitely be back to try other brews, lattes, etc.
i tested them to see if they remembered me and my girlfriend as regulars. they seemed skeptical at first but they remembered us! they remembered our names and what we always get!! this is the reason why i will keep coming back. come here asap!!! you wont regret coming here i promise. all about the jasmine latte with boba and lychee
brew tea bar is my new fav place in town! they have great customer service and amazing boba milk tea! i have had their thai tea and strawberry milk tea and both are really good. i cant wait to try other stuff on their menu. my bf always gets the ginger root and rooibos mix with no sweetener. he says its some of the best tea he has ever had! they are all knowledgable and helped him with the recommendation since he is super picky about his tea. check them out! they are great!
great customer service, warm greeting from employees to every guest who enters! lots of smiles from the employees as well. ordered their rose milk tea with double boba. the boba was a perfect combo of soft and chewy with a great flavor. the tea was floral and a little tart, just what to expect with a rose tea. they had me try it before i left to make sure it was good : its the little things that make all the difference! i will be back and im excited to try their other items!
my friend and i were craving boba, but the spot we usually go to was kung fu tea so we went here cause it was closer. i was so happy that we tried it out! we went around 4pm in the afternoon and there was no line! the interior is nice and modern, it could defiantly be a place to sit down an chill. they should have games though cause everyone loves games especially board games! the service was nice and fast! i got my usual which is jasmine milk tea with boba! i was very impressed! the boba was warm and soft so you know they just made it and my jasmine milk tea was the perfect sweetness! you havent tried it, i suggest that you should try! plus, its nice to know thats theres good boba on this side of town :
if it wasnt clear already, btb is definitely the place to be! im not sure if theres any numbers to back it up, but theyve got to be one of the fastest reviewed placed in vegas this year. only 2 months in to being open, theyve gotten well over 100 reviews, and nearly every one is positive. rightfully so though. my checkins will show ive probably been here way too much, and weve already started working on our 4th stamp card. i imagine thats nothing compared to some people though, as this place is almost always packed!aside from having an excellent product, btb has some of the best service you can find in this city, by far. sou, louis and dennis are not only extremely passionate about their product, but are dedicated to providing outstanding customer service. it didnt take but a couple times of us coming in here before they knew all of our names, and remembered both mine and deegans drink. i know for a fact they are seeing a bunch of people everyday, so little things like that are what people are going to remember. they may not be from vegas, but they are making this a locals spot like no other. as i mentioned, weve been here a lot and been able to try a good amount from the menu. there are a few things though that i really cant stay away from. the cold brew is absolutely delicious, and btb is definitely not afraid to make it strong. ive gotten it on its own to take home, and while its not the best by itself, the addition of sea salt creme makes it incredibly addicting. thankfully i dont have near the sensitivity to caffeine as most do and can down a large one of these, with less ice of course, no problem. i like the bold coffee flavor that has virtually no bitterness from being cold brewed, and the addition of sea salt and honey boba makes for what i think is one of the most perfectly balanced boba drinks in town. thats not to say there other drinks arent equally as good though. deegans favorite drink is the hokkaido milk tea, which is extremely creamy with a carameltoffee flavor. their okinawa milk tea and coffee milk tea are two of my other favorites, and im even more of a fan of their other lattes, specifically the black tea and oolong tea varieties. so far, there hasnt been anything ive tried that i didnt like. and if that just so happens to be the case with your drink, it wont matter much as the guys at btb will remake it for you anyway. they proudly stand behind their product 100 and if you dont like what you got, they will either adjust it, or get you a new drink without blinking an eye. if youre not a fan boba or tea fan, btb also has fresh made to order crepes. you can watch your crepe being made right after you order it, and while weve only tried one, the pb, it was delicious and recommended. its packed full of peanut butter, banana and strawberry. the crepe is light, sweet and is even better with an iced cold tea alongside it. you can also customize your crepe like you can the drinks, and make it just how you like.whatever you come here for, youre likely to leave satisfied. and if you havent been here yet, you are definitely missing out!
my favorite boba place in vegas!  the guys working are so nice and helpful and the drinks are the best! their boba is always warm when i go and they have such amazing service no place else compares.
they just changed the boba game in vegas. all the other bobas in town, especially the boba balls, just taste dull to us now. the actual boba balls here are so soft, chewy and have a hint of honey flavor. were addicted lol.
very good tea selection, excellent taste, quality service and all at a reasonable price.
i dont know where i would be without this place. although they just opened only a few weeks ago, i am hooked. i come here every single weekend. not kidding i just cant get enough of this place! every thing ive tried on their menu has been perfect. and sou, the owner is amazing! hes so helpful and really cares for his customers satisfaction. even his employees are down right awesome! this is my place to go for a new refreshing cup of bubble tea. and i will definitely going back next weekend ;
really appreciate how they make sure the customer is 100 satisfied with their order. i got the rose milk tea with boba and it isnt too sweet and tastes just right. bobas good too
btb has accomplished the unthinkable... this is the first time i have ever done this, but im bumping them up to 5 stars!whatever problems i found with them in the beginning have been solved. boba is now consistently top notch by vegas standards and often still deliciously warm. i can ask for less sweet and will actually receive a drink that is perfect for my taste buds.screw the original brew milk tea and the hokkaido milk tea! its all about that okinawa. tastes like asia. i also like their cold brew coffee with sea salt cream and the strawberry milky slush. congrats, btb. youve done well enough to keep me coming back at least every other day.
this is the best tea in town. and its close too! boba made every few hours and will make you a new drink if you dont like your first choice. the employees try to learn your name and drink preference when you come in. they are proud of their drinks and you can tell they are thrilled to be there each day. the place isnt huge, but they make up in selection. the okinawa, less sweet, is my personal favorite. though, you can go wrong with any of their drinks. cant wait for them to grow and add to their menu!
brew tea bar is by far my favorite boba spot in vegas now. finally a good boba spot that isnt in chinatown! ive been here a total of three times, and ive left satisfied each time. so far ive tried the hokkaido with boba, the okinawa with boba, and then half hokkaidookinawa with boba. the last one was actually my favorite bc the taste is perfection. i dont like my drinks super sweet, and this just satisfies my boba cravings. oh yeaaaah, and the texture of the boba is probably my favorite part. im usually the type of person that sticks to the same thing on the menu, because im too scared to try something i wont like. however, i feel like i can get mostly anything on the menu  enjoy it. aside from my drink orders, the service is also exceptional. all the workers are very friendly and helpful. julien is the best at helping me decide what to get. i give props to all of the workers because it can get really busy. i definitely recommend this place. cant wait to come back  try other drinks and the crepes!!
this is the best best boba place !!! thank god its close to my home . friendly workers  best customer service no matter how busy it gets . so far ive tried thai tea slush perfect taste not to sweet. also not a big fan of any matcha green tea but have to say i love their matcha green tea !
best tea bar in town. their taro milk tea is the best. made with real taro! the guys in there are awesome!
new spot, a must check out. the girl was very friendly and informative for our first visit. i love the satisfaction guarantee, i will not explain it, so i do not miss quote anything, but i think its great, shows they back up their product. we had there ice tea, love black tea, plus tried there crepe, mmmm, delicious. definitely will be back!
omg this place is the best. you have to try their hokkaido tea if you prefer creamier boba. i used to love kung fu tea but this is probably my new favorite boba place in vegas. kung fu tea is still decent too tho.
fast. fresh. convenient if you need a boba fix in the southwest area! also, prices 3, which is an a in m book.
the best tea place in las vegas. i come here 3 times a week and every time i try new drinks
i knew i would love this place when i heard boys boys boys by lady gaga as i stepped inside and my ears tinged with joy. the staff is fantastic and helpfulone of the employees asked if it was my first time yes and explained a few of the drinks.  so i settled on the okinawa milk tea and was delighted with my choice. it was smooth and not too sweet. the presentation of the drink supersedes other boba places. yes, i know its just a drink, but i like the attention to details: black straws and brown sleeve with their cute logo. it was social media ready. and the details extended into the interior: soft lighting, simple decor, and wood furniture. plus, one of the employees asked if i needed the wifi as i ensconced myself onto their table with my laptop. so friendly! before i left, i bought two drinks togo: iced coffee brew and milk tea. they were both good. officially, my favorite boba tea place and i dont even like boba that much.
this place is the place to go if you are craving boba! the tapioca is made to perfection! : the texture is exactly how all boba should taste like. i tried the brew milk tea which is a regular milk tea and it is super good! add boba because it is a must!!! the taro milk tea is also very good, it taste like real taro! the rose milk tastes a little bit like lychee ^,^ the green milk tea is very good as well but add a shot of jasmine tea ; i enjoy every drink i tried here. the tea here is freshly brewed which is an extra plus. the staff here is also amazing!!!!! super friendly! : they remember their regulars by name and they make everyone feel welcome! they are willing to work with you and they always have a smile. ^,^ they have a sign that says if you dont like your drink they will make you something else. this shows that they are willing to work with you until you find a drink you love! they want everyone to be satisfied which is rare these days! this place is just awesome!
this place is awesome! i cant look at any other boba place the same!  i also cant wait to go back and try all the other drinks available!
brew tea bar is my favorite boba place. i just tried the place a little over 2 weeks ago and i am completely in love with this place. i have already filled out my first stamp card. lets talk about the owner and the staff: they are the nicest people i have ever meet. the owner really knows his tea as well. he makes suggestions and allows for changes to your tea if you dont like the way it tastes. the tea itself: okie so i really am into trying different things. they have a lot of teas the peak my interest. however, my favorite and something that i can never get enough of is the hokkaido tea with egg pudding and boba. its so yummy. although, it is more cream based since the tea is based of a japanese toffee cream. if you are more into the flavor of black team i recommend the okinawa teamy sisters favorite. however, something that i like is the owner recommended to mix them together. it was still delicious. i just love creamy stuff though. rose tea is also another one that i really enjoy.i feel as though there isnt a bad thing on their menu and they really care about what the costumer likes. like i said if you dont like it they will remake it for youalso, something really cool is you can add the sea salt foam to your drinks. which is amazing!!the atmosphereambiance of the place is so cute and welcoming. its got a kinda contemporary japan feel to it. i love the tables and sets. there is seating outside. the place is kinda small but at the same time it has a cuteness too it. i enjoy sitting there and being able to do some work on my laptop as well. its just a very chill environment that can also be intimate and great for friends gathering together.overall, i love this place and continually go back.
i had the okinawahokkaido combo milk tea with honey boba based on the owners recommendation. it was delicious!!! i stuck with the the okinawa milk tea on my second visit, as i wanted something where i could taste the tea more. great flavors and the boba is also amaaaaaazeballs. soft, chewy, sorta warm, and filled with honey!!!!awesome service, positive spirit. place is small, but ill be coming back for their teas.
sea salt!!!i no longer have to drive all the way to california!!! to get my sea salt coffee or tea fix anymore ahahhaha when i walked in i got a kick in the face of tea smell which is pretty cool but i think there was a bit of spice smell too which was a bit overwhelming for me... the cashier whom i think was the owner because he definitely knew what he was talking about  gave me some recommendations since i told him it was my first time. i saw crepes on the menu too which i will definitely have to come back for! i was on a bit of a time crunch since i wanted to grab a drink before work.taro milk tea 3.50  i got the regular size since i was getting 2 drinks but this made me fall in love!! look.. usually taro milk tea drinks are way too sweet because they make it w powder but this was made perfectly which i also think is made w real taro cuz i can taste the chunks  it was the perfect amount of sweetness!! the boba was also perfect texture while the boba was still a little warm! okinawa sea salt latte  4.75  i got the large size... i will have to say... i wasnt too impressed w this one... i think it was a little too sweet for me... but i had to run so i didnt get to taste it until i was half way to work.honestly i will be back!! i literally gave up boba for a while since i lived in vegas because they all disappointed me..   or the distance affects it a lot too but now that i have one on the way to work!! muwhahahahaha you guys will definitely see me more often...
as this place has so many great reviews i will not go into the mundane details as i dont think it is necessary.  what i will do is point out why i think this great tea bar deserves the 5 star rating they have been getting from so many people.     i have been to this location on several occasions at different times of the day.  what i have noticed that sets therm apart from their competitors is they always seem to have 3 people behind the counter.  regardless of how long the line is to order things move fast and in a orderly fashion.  the other boba place near me is a one person show.  since coming here i havent went back to the other place.     quality is another big difference.  the ingredients and the amazing flavors of their drinks is also a big difference.  the taro slushy is very tasty but add in the scoop of taro they add and it is in a class all by itself.  i had the matcha slushy the other day and it was perfection.  they have a sign that says if you dont like your drink we will make you another one.  it is impressive they take such pride in what they serve.  the staff is always friendly and smiling.  you can tell they love what they are doing.  they definitely know how important customer service is and they do a fantastic job!   additonally, they have a loyalty program that after 10 drinks you get one free.  their prices are very reasonable and comparable to their competitors.   but the quality you get is truly what sets brew tea bar apart form all the others.   this is the best of vegas!
i have to admit, i can see why btb has such a high rating. they exceed your expectations and more. the customer service was just wow. i was blown away. i came in not knowing what i wanted but that was quickly changed after the cashier helped me out. i have to give a shout out to sou and dennis. you guys rock! you guys got me hooked onto everything!the drinks were out of this world. or at least this country. i recently visited taiwan birthplace of boba and had a lot of different boba. btb was the closest i can get a taste of taiwan. the boba itself was soft, warm, and sweet unlike other places that are reminiscent of pellets. the drinks were so fresh. you can taste the quality in all of them. i needed a quick picker upper since i had a long drive back to la. so i decided to get their coffee. i was torn between that or the sea salt oolong. sou mentioned that i could actually get sea salt coffee and that hit the spot! 85 has nothing on them!! this coffee had it all; it had the punch, the creaminess, and sweetsavory aspect. i would definitely recommend any of their tea lattes any day of the week. their hokkaido milk tea was better than most places. it had just the right amount of sweetness where the condensed milk doesnt overpower the flavor of the tea. but my palette is different than yours so if your drink is too sweet you can actually change it, free of charge. of course that goes for any drinks on the menu. i cant wait to go back! definitely worth the drive. keep up the good work guys!!
other than kung fu tea, i have never had amazing boba in such a long time. i actually havent been here during a rush or when all the seats were taken so i found that the environment seemed more relaxing and nice. the first time i came, i got the okinawa milk tea with boba and it was genuinely the best milk tea i have ever had. i also ordered a taro slush for my sister and they asked me if i wanted real taro on top. the boba is so good like the consistency is just great.the man who served me both times is named sou and i seriously love how their names are printed onto their shirts so you know who the excellent employee was who served you. well other than sou, the other employees were super nice as well! anyways, i came again today to try out their smokey mountain oolong latte and i think i have dangerously fallen in love with btb. overall, the interior is simple and easy to chill out in. then, the employees wereare so friendly. thank you guys once again for greeting me on my way in and for thanking me on my way out! this place is truly fire and i will be definitely coming back for that oolong latte!
awesome boba place! they have honey boba which is awesome! i havent been to a boba place here in vegas that had the same quality service as those in cali. this place surpassed all expectations! i ordered the jasmine milk tea with boba and when given the beverage, was told that if it was too sweet theyd remake it for me! awesome of them to offer that! i will definitely be back when im in the area and craving some boba tea. they will also be selling loose leaf tea closer to the holidays! ive been looking for a place locally that offered it and im excited for it to come!
okaaaay, so. brew tea bar is my favorite boba place in vegas. hands down. one of my goals is to try every single drink on their menu. ive tried all of the ice teas so far. ive pretty much liked every single thing ive tried. i love that you can customize it so that it has less or no sweetener! i usually get my ice teas with no sweetener and it still tastes amazing. im really excited to taste their milk teas. the boba is never undercooked or overcooked, its always perfect! this place is the only place i trust when it comes to the lychee jelly.  the egg pudding . the staff is wonderful too! they greet me by my name right when i come in! but thats probably because i go there almost everyday lol. this is honestly the best boba place we have in vegas.
i was really excited to see a boba shop on this side of town so i decided to stop by after lunch. i got a taro milk tea w boba and it was delicious. they used real taro  it was just the right amount. the boba had a good chew and flavor to it as well. this is definitely my new spot for boba.
the service here is phenomenal. everyone is friendly and very concerned with the customer and their experience. on top of that, their drinks are delicious. i love the mango and lychee green teas. i was never a frequent boba tea drinker until i stumbled across this place which replaced another mediocre bobacrepe shop. i cant wait to try more things on their menu because theyve all been amazing so far. this place is a must!
i dont think words can describe how much i love brew tea bar! what makes it even better is that its only a couple minutes away from my house! i literally go here every day, its pretty embarrassing..on my first visit, i ordered the honey milk tea with honey boba and pudding, which was alright. i also tried their caramel slushy i dont know exactly what its called but it was waaaay too sweet for me. my boyfriend then introduced me to my favorite drink, hokkaido milk tea with honey boba also good with grass jelly !!! im so in love with this drink, you have no idea! its all i ever get and i refuse to drink anything else, because its that good. if you like milky drinks like i do, then i highly recommend getting the hokkaido milk tea! i recommend trying their crepes as well!not only is their boba perfect, but they also have excellent customer service! i love how they are willing to adjust your drink to your liking. i also love how the employees remember me and my boyfriend! we come here so often that sometimes they give us a large instead of a regular drink, which is awesome!this place just has really chill vibes and a friendly environment. i dont think ill ever go to another boba place, because this is honestly the best one we have in vegas.
love this place!!  employees are very friendly!  mango green tea with boba....so good!
hi lv yelpers!!! moving to the bay and trying to check out all the hot and new in my neighborhood before i leave the city. got super excited when i seen a new boba spot in the area! im a boba addict. sou the owner was really friendly and suggested i try their taro slush with a scoop of taro! this is the best boba by far i had in the city! love that they have a punchcard! indoor outdoor seating. parking lot. im planning on coming back a few more times before i move to try the rest of the slushes. ive been driving to chinatown for boba so its nice to have a legit boba shop down the street from me. im a fan!! miss yelp 2015
we have been on the search for a milk tea place since moving out to vegas. the places weve tried prior to brew tea have been ok... but the bubbles have been too soft or inconsistent within my drink. otherwise, the milk tea has a coffeeish flavor which is... weird? i wasnt expecting coffee? anyways, we decided to try this place out and im soo glad we did! its a little from where we live so unfortunately its not as convenient to just go on a whim. i ordered the okinawa milk tea with bubbles and the bf ordered the honey dew slush with bubbles. both were delicious and the bubbles were the nice, chewy consistency that i liked. : : the servers there were super nice and it seems like a nice, chill atmosphere to hang out and enjoy the drinks. definitely going back in the near future!
been here more than i count with my fingers and i could now say this will my official goto boba place. each time i go here i leave satisfied they can change your drink for you if youre not satisfied with it. the drinks are made to order, and the boba is always fresh, warm, and chewy. prices are cheap too and the sizes of the drinks go with the price. they also serve crepes which is also super good! ambiance is simple and elegant which is nice, and the staff is even nicer. they always greet you and offer you the menu when you walk in. they always communicate to you and see if youre drinks taste okay. i dont have a favorite drink because seriously every drink ive tried is delicious. but ive challenged myself to try the whole menu someday
im here on the daily even though its a little out of my way home from work. why? forget making you read a lengthy review which i can def write for you!...just go in and give it a try!!! you wont be let down. i recommend the rose milk tea!
great service. this is the only place i know that serves egg pudding in their milk tea. it was good! not too sweet. i had the rose milk tea. delicious!
the hokkaido bubble tea with boba is amazing. very rich in flavor and the bobas are fresh and sweet the way its made. love the fact they give you a stamp card. will be coming back here as a regular!
i finally got to visit this place and i like it a lot i do wish they had more unique drinks but i did try one that ive never heard before.  hokkaido milk tea, and it was amazing!!! i was with two others who had the same drink and describes it as cereal milk. its a bit hard to describe. all in all i definitely want to go again. i did see a house tea and that would probably be my next pick. absolutely a good to go place
the drinks are freshly made and the customer service is fantastic! lots of great fresh teas and even crepes! im currently enjoying a lychee slush and it is delicious! i would definitely recommend this place.
quality, service, unique all around! finally a asian spot that exhibits these three components!
this place is an overall 5 stars! from the quality of their drinks to the customized delicious crepe topped off with genuinely nice staff! the energy is great because you can tell by the staffs body language that they truly want you to be satisfied by their smile  attitude! i love that they give u ur drink and tell u that if its not ok they can fix it. so priceless for a picky customer like me. no other place says that with sincerity. i hope they keep it up  continue to bring in great staff! i will be coming back regularly  recommending to all my friends!
best boba place in vegas.
i didnt want to believe the hype but its true. brew tea bar what i had mistaken initially for the bar downtown is going to reign as a prevalent business in vegas.located not too far off the 215 from s. rainbow, you can find this establishment in the albertson parking lot on the left by the haircut place. setting: keep it open and free of cluttered, a lot of businesses particularly asian ones forget this. often attempting to endorse as many products as they can, brew tea bar keeps it simple which is a golden guideline for me. basic menu categorized as slush reg: 3.95, lrg: 4.95, latte tea reg: 3.75, lrg: 4.75, ice tea reg: 2.85, lrg: 3.85, milk tea reg: 3.5, lrg: 4.5, fresh brew lrg only 4.95, and crepes 4.95. i wouldnt recommend this place to study or get work done due to the limited space and how busy it can get here. service: very accommodating and willing to make any adjustments to drinks. talk about taking an initiative to keep the customer happy. drink: i opted to mix the hokkaido and okinawa milk tea which was a great idea thanks to the yelper who left the tip. server had told me that it was sweet and adjusted the sweetness for me. overall: im looking forward to new locations, keep up the concern for customer satisfaction and brew tea bar will become prevalent on every street corner. nice work guys!
i was skeptical of the hype but omg this place serves perfection in a cup! ive been coming here every sat  sun and i cant get enough of this place!!! if i could id just spend all day here trying everything on their menu. they have a great staff with great service too. if you dont like your drink, they will remake to your liking and they really stick to their word about that. their teas are really sweet but its not a big deal, they make it to my liking, i just tell them 14 sugar. im beyond ecstatic somebody finally introduced sea salt cream to vegas. in my opinion, best teaboba shop in lv, even better than any place on spring mountain. i just wish they were open earlier so i could get my daily morning coffee from here before i go to work. also i just noticed the crepes on their menu today... next weekend that is a must try for me. my goal is to try every single drink on their menu then ill update again but so far i have not been dissapointed :
one of us called this place the coffee prince cafe of lv.we were greeted by four helpful baristas, with stu being our helpful guide as we asked a few questions to customize our drinks better. dont like the hokkaido too sweet? try it combined with their okinawa. want sea salt foam? just describe to them your liking. want real taro with your taro shake? can do. too sweet? that can be fixed. great customer service. we ordered several drinks, but our favorites were the taro smoothie with real taro, the hokkaidookinawa with egg pudding, and matcha green latte with soy milk. treating these drinks like a tea or coffee expert  we need more of these businesses.
brew tear bars five stars are wellearned. not only are their drinks truly delicious, they go out of their way to make sure you are actually satisfied with it before you leave their cafe. i observed the brewers tasting sanitarily via a spoon and a separate tasting cup samples of their work to make sure it was okay.i had the hot taro milk tea no boba and was blown away by the flavor. unfortunately, brew tea bar is on the other side of town from me, so i will not be able to get their drinks everyday as i would have wanted.
really friendly staff, very willing to make adjustments or remake your drink to your liking. best boba in town, soft and chewy even in cold drinks 30 min later, nice honey and brown sugar sweetness...not too sweet and definitely not bland like some other places. very good tea flavor and great tea:milk ratio. tried the okinawa milk tea not as heavy as hokkaido and more tea than milk flavor. loved it!
were from la and this is hands down the best teabolba shop. fiendly staff, clean shop, and excellent drinks! they set the standard for quality and great service. we had the lychee peachy green tea, taro slushy with real taro, and fresh brewed coffee with sea salt cream. all 3 drinks were amazingly refreshing with the perfect amount of sweetness! please come to the san garbeiel valley!!!we highly recommend this place! see you guys tomorrow!
love the milk teas and very friendly staff!!! i thought they closed at 11 so we came in around 9:45 but they actually closed at 10 no one likes last minute customers. they still served us with no attitude :
i got the hokkaido milk tea. the bf got the oolong latte. i personally like the oolong latte more. the service was good, theyll let u send back the drink or adjust your sweetness level if you dont like the way it tastes.
best bubble tea although i never actually get it with boba in vegas! my favorite is the jasmine latte with sea salt cream. ive never had anything like it, so yummy! ive tried the black tea latte once too but immediately regretted it. it was really good, but definitely not as good as the jasmine latte. i tried it for the first time last sunday and i already have half of my stamp card filled out... im obsessed!

went on saturday 101015.  drove 30 minutes to get here and see what all the hype is about.  i had been reading the glowing yelp reviews for months and was very excited to finally try their drinks and especially to try their sea salt creme that everyone was raving about.  i ordered a hokkaido milk tea with boba and sea salt creme and the young man behind the counter looked up and shot an eyebrow up at me and said are you sure?  the hokkaido is already really creamy. so i went with his suggestion.  4.32 got me a hokkaido milk tea with boba regular size.  absolutely wonderful.  right up there with kung fu tea in my book.  i wish i had another one of these right now!!!  next time i go i will get something i can add that elusive sea salt creme to.  maybe an iced coffee?
were fairly new to the area. when my daughter wanted crepes, we decided to try this place out. the atmosphere, the workers even are so inviting and friendly. it can get busy, but the wait is worth it. my favorite is the taro milk tea. my kids like the honey dew and the crepes there are delicious. you wont be disappointed. prices are very reasonable as well.
the tea was amazing here and carefully brewed to meet your satisfaction. i ordered the hokkaido milk tea and thought it was too sweet. i wanted more of a tea taste so they remade it with some okinawa tea. i was a happy camper after that. my friend ordered the high mountain oolong tea latte with sea salt cream. that was great, too! we had a nice conversation with who we think is the owner about the various boba shops weve been to. it was great to be able to talk to someone who had such passion and cared about his craft. would love to come back whenever im in vegas again for quality tea. until then, ill keep wishing they open up shop in the bay area!
spent a weekend at vegas for the rise festival and decided to stop by this little boba shop. i ordered the brew tea with boba, the sea salt high mountain oolong tea, the sea salt cold brew coffee, and the berry lover crepe. i highly recommend the drinks. drinks were perfect and boba was freshly made. everyone working was extremely helpful! would definitely come back.
i come here way too often considering that i live 30 minutes away from this place... like they even know my name thats how you know its real. 」゜ロ゜」anyways, i believe that brew tea bar is the absolute goto place for the best milk tea boba in the city. every time i get boba, its just the right amount of softness and squish except for that one time where my friend and i got the very last batch of boba. ive tried a variety of their milk teas, but my absolutely favorite is the hokkaido milk tea. one time i even told them to surprise me with a milk tea which put some pressure on them haha and they ended up giving me coconut milk tea. im not usually fond of coconut, but the drink was gone before i knew it. one of the great things to note about their flavors such as taro milk tea and coconut milk tea is that they use real taro and real coconut, which is probably why i really enjoyed the coconut milk tea!as for brewed teas, ive only had an iced rooibos tea i forgot how to spell it w honey, which i have become addicted to lately. each brewed tea is brewed with loose leaf tea and customers even have the option of taking a whiff of the tea leaves. im not sure if this goes for all brewed teas, but my drink was only available in large.im also very fond of their sea salt lattes, but one time i had a drink that was ridiculously salty and i didnt really think to tell them about how salty it was until i mindlessly drank half of my drink; however, sou wanted to make sure that my drink was enjoyable and he ended up replacing the entire drink. kudos even though i felt bad for drinking half of the drink already. customer service is definitely an importance at this establishment!i wouldnt recommend coming here to study due to the limited amount of space for seating, but its possible if youre studying with at least up to 3 other people to avoid one person to a table for 4. the staff is extremely friendly and have been personable for my regular btb experience and im really glad that they chose to open up their business in las vegas even though its a bit of a drive from my home.its actually sad to think about how much money ive spent on drinks at this place even though theyve only been open for a few months... but i have become addicted.
came in late in the day craving some boba after going grocery shopping. got a lychee and peach green tea unsweetened and omg that boba was so good. soft chewy and sweet.
i come here probably 46x a week. beforeafter school and work. id say they are the best bobateacoffee shop in vegas. their boba is super fresh and their teascoffees are brewed to perfection. would definitely recommend this place, their prices are reasonable.not only are the drinks extremely tasty, their customer service is 55, the well swap your drink if you dont like it policy came quite apealing. the staff are all friendly and make you feel at home. try their cold brew with sea salt creme. dont mix it, drink it from the top  or the okinawa with boba. so bomb.
we were in town for a few days and found this place on yelp. decided to take a detour on the way to the hotel to try their drinks. definitely glad we were able to find brew tea thanks to yelp! we tried the okinawa milk tea with boba and the cold brew coffee with sea salt cream and boba. both were very tasty and their boba is the perfect texture. after giving our drinks, they asked us to try before leaving to make sure we were satisfied with the taste and sweetness. no adjustments were needed but we appreciated that they wanted to make sure their customers were happy with their drinks before leaving. we will be adding brew tea to our list of places to stop by whenever were in vegas.
ive been reading reviews for this place for a while and really wanted to check it out! so finally got the chance when i was out with my mom and told her lets go to this tea place i heard so much about! soon as we walked in and checking out their menu one of the employees, soo pretty sure that is not you spell his name haha, was super helpful and explained to us some of the items. my mom got this cold brew coffee with salted cream on top apparently that is their secret menu, and i wanted to try the hokkaido milk tea since everyone who goes here says its absolutely delicious. spoiled ourselves too with their classic crepe item :deverything was delicious! i tried my moms drink and coffee was well brewed and the salted ice cream was just divine. like everyone said about the hokkaido milk tea it was pretty good! love to try the cold coffee myself when i go back ;
seriously my new obsession!!! i love love love this place. the drinks are great and the customer service is phenomenal! i found this place 3 days ago and i have already gone twice. so far i have tried the sunset with boba and their house brew with boba. both were super good and the even better news is if i didnt like either one they would have made me a new one. great job brew tea! thank you and i will be back..probably today!
brew tea bar is da bomb.com!!! im so addicted to this place! i love their taro slush with boba and lychee jelly....yummmmm and gotta have it at least twice a week :. their customer service is top notch. everyone is so friendly and so happy to helpserve you the minute you walk through the door.
gotta give five stars for impeccable service. they really do not stop until their customers are happy and satisfied with their drinks which i admire so much. thanks again for a great experience! will return for boba soon.
delicious! i ordered an earl grey with sea salt cream and boba with a berry crepe togo. they were great! the staff was so nice and sweet. i had my dog in my running car and they said theyd bring out my order. they were just great people. they were also very busy at 11am, so they must be great super friendly people! soft, chewy, perfect boba. im happy
love brew tea barthis is definitely my new fav boba place in town.its busy because its getting quite popular but their service is quick!if you dont like something about your order, they will fix it for you add more sugar, less sugar, etc.staff here are super friendly!theres tons of parking out front because its in the same complex as the albertsons.
now this is the best boba in town. hands down. end of story.what can i say that hasnt already been hilariously and wonderfully said by philip t? the tea here is brewed well with great flavor. they always tell you to try the drink and if its not to your liking, they will remake it. the boba is always bouncychewyperfect. they have a great selection. the only thing they are missing is adequate seating....and the decor is a little bare. service is super friendly and they always address you by name! amazingggg. tip: they have a loyalty card, so if you buy 10 drinks, you get one free :
omg.....brew tea bar....omg....my first visit....i had to get a milk tea and a slushie.....lolsince it was my first time....i figured i would try their the brew milk tea since it was their special mix.  and it did not disappoint. it was delicious! i love milk tea and have had it at multiple places....and btb completely rocks it!!!  and if you like egg pudding. . .get it here.  it is the absolute best egg pudding that i have ever had. . .it is sooooo silky and totally just melts away when you slurp it up with the tea.    totally delish!since my first visit. i have been there too many times to count. . .and everthing that i have tried from all the different teas to the cold brew coffee with their salted foam is sooooo freaking good!!!  i wake up craving the teas from here. . .i am sooo glad that they opened up so close to my home. . .i might as well just give them my paycheck!  lol  yes they are that good and i want to go to them to get tea multiple times a week!  they are crazy good!!!!  i would highly reccomend them to anyone that is craving some awesome delicious tea. . .or just want to try something new!    seriously, just get one. . .you wont regret it!!!  
ive only had drinks crom this place twice. both times were not disappointing at all! the first time i ordered a rose milk tea, the sweetness was right and it tasted a lot better than what ive had  icy juicy there were still powder chunks in there, blehkk.the second time i came here, i had ordered a honey chrysanthemum tea. it was the first time i had ever tried it and it wasnt a bad at all. it tasted great and the presentation of the drink was so pretty! my brother had the milk slush. it was a bit too sweet for me, but my brother liked it a lot.im pretty sure ill be back here to try out more drinks.i just wish they had grass jelly, then this would be the boba spot i go to everyday. wouldnt have to drive all the way down into seoul marketplace.
walked in and i was greeted with the most friendly workers. they asked if it was my first time and i said yes. the worker came around from the working counter and stood next to me explaining the menu and their popular drinks. he also explained what hokkaido and okinawa milk tea was. i came here to try the taro slush, which i got and was not disappointed. its taro slush with boba and topped off with real taro. it was amazingif you are a fan of taro. lastly i saw that they had crepes and impulsively ordered crepes with banana ,nutella and green tea ice cream. the toppings of the crepes were their usual delicious self but what was amazing about the crepes was how soft it was, as a crepe should be. lastly they give out stamp cards. buy 10 drinks and get 1 free. i will be coming back soon with more people.
this is probably the best boba tea shop in all of las vegas! they make fresh boba everyday. i love that you can get soy or almond milk instead of non dairydairy creamer. they have crepes, that look amazing. i did not try them. i did try the loose leaf teas and they are great!!!
this is the best boba place with the best customer service hands down. i stuck to one boba place for a bit but this will be my new go to spot. you will not be dissapointed at all with their selections and customer service is superb.
i think this may be my new favorite place to get boba, which is saying a lot for me because i amwas a diehard kung fu tea fan.  the shop itself is pretty small and clean with minimalist style decorations.  the workers behind the counter were extremely friendly when i ordered my drink.  i ordered a regular sized taro milk tea with boba 4.50.  i only had to wait a few minutes, but the workers kept apologizing for the wait because they were making a new batch of boba.  i didnt really mind at all because i appreciate fresh boba, but they upgraded my drink from a regular size to the large size free of charge because of it.  the boba was the perfect consistency and the taro milk tea was delicious.  definitely will be back!
its not often that an establishment will force my hand to reconsider my ratings, but brew tea bar aka btb for the hip kids, is one of those places. i originally gave them 4 stars thinking they were just another decently good boba place. i thought they were just another place to grab a drink and go. i thought they were just small competition for my previous gotospot for boba.. i thought wrong..after a bit more exploring their wide variety of drinks on their menu, and a few long and exhausting study sessions there thanks unlv.. i discovered there was more than what i knew about boba. there existed things like real taro slushes that dont taste overly artificial, or okinawa tea that doesnt jip you flat on flavor. brew tea bar also offers the love your drink or we will remake for free deal not that i ever had to have a drink remade. staff is also 247 friendly and welcoming. their crepes are fresh and about half price of competitors, and their clean interior and free wifi makes it an ideal place to study not like other boba cafes that play a strange playlist of korean pop mixed with mainstream radio hits on max volume and reek of second hand smoke, yuck!.brew tea bar, i salute you with the honorary 5 star rating, buon lavoro, good job!
i love this place! the prices are not bad at all, really cheap! i love there crepes and there honeydew slush with boba. the service is quick when its just a few people in there but when it gets to the afternoon, it usually gets busy.
such a great place! the employees are super friendly and helpful and the tea is delicious! they explained everything on the menu to me and they offer tore make your tea if youre not satisfied with the taste. i got the jasmine milk tea with boba and egg pudding. i highly recommend this little gem!
been coming to brew tea for a few months now.  best boba that we have found.  the staff is very helpful  friendly.  my drinks have been spot on but have seen them adjust ones if not to a customers liking with a smile on their face.  we tried their crepes recently, and omg! delicious   definitely a place to check out.
alright, im finally hopping on this brew tea bar train. i finally got to try out this joint after months of reading and hearing about how great it was. was there hype surrounding btb? definitely. but did it live up to it? ummm yes!although it is pretty far from me henderson, i was out on the west side of town and  decided to drop in for a refreshing snack. the shop itself is very quaint with several tables and chairs to socialize. unfortunately, i dont think this is a great place to study which is something im still looking for in a cafei digress. there is a very extensive menu that i was overwhelmed at first, especially with a growing line behind me. the worker manning the front was very patient and helpful! he went through a couple of his personal and customer favorites and explained what their hokkaido and okinawan milk teas were. i opted for the hokkaido milk tea with boba and also got to try my friends okinawan milk tea brown sugar taste one sip of the hokkaido and i had flashbacks of japan! it was quite enjoyable but a little too sweet for my tastes. ill opt for a less sweet version next time. overall, definitely my favorite place to grab drinksslushesteas now with great staff and lots of tasty options!
love this place!!!!! a large list of teas and you can modify as well. the staff here is amazing and they have a guaranteed policy so if you dont like it theyll make it again or you can try something else. they also have a loyalty program so make sure you get your stamps in!
this place deserves 5 stars. i consider myself a boba snob. up until ive discovered this gem, cali had my heart. time after time this place proved to be the best  all drinks made fresh to perfection, boba made daily soft and chewy, friendly staff. boba smile guaranteed!
unlike others, i went with herbal tea rather than milk tea so i ordered smoked oolong tea with boba. i was totally in love with it since they made it strong that i could really tasted the tea flavour. boba were also chewy and consistent. def gonna come backk
im not much for boba and milk tea and all, friends took me to many places and i never cared for anything i tried.. then i went to a tea house and the lady there asked what kind of teas i like.. after telling her im from the south and love sweet tea, she goes and gets me a manga tea, and that started my addiction to boba and tea.. then this place opens up down the road.. only took me about 4 times before dennis remembered my name and made me feel like a regular.. memorizing my order, and always making sure i liked the tea before i left. ive tried a couple different teas that dennis recommended but always back to my mango black tea.. ive never had a bad tea here place is perfect
imho, best boba place in town, hands down.the staff is really friendly. theyll always have a smile on their face and even greet you by name if youre a regular! the best part is, they guarantee your drink is to your liking or theyll remake it for free! a lot of the times, ill go in not knowing what i want, and have sou offer his recommendations on what i should try. sore throat? try the ginger and honey tea. ate a little too much at your last meal? try the rooibos fresh brew. whatever it is, just ask what tea they recommend and they will gladly offer their suggestions!my personal favs include: their regular the brew milk tea, the caramel milk tea if im having an exceptionally sweet tooth at the moment, the taro smoothie with a scoop of taro, and their cold brew coffee with sea salt cream. i havent tried everything on their menu yet, but its just so hard to deviate from those 4 choices! also, their crepes are to die for. make sure you get it with ice cream! i usually go with the classic nutella, strawberry, banana with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. yummm
was visiting vegas, and came here since i needed my tea fix. i have surveyed many of the tea houses in the 626 in los angeles, and this place is just as good as the top tier places. i tried the honey green tea at half sweetless ice with grass jelly and it was spot on. the green tea had a nice deep brew flavor and the hints of bitterness came through with the grass jelly. apparently, they make their own grass jelly, so no canned products here. the sweetness level was near perfection and i was able to savor that genuine honey. yummy! service was superb. solid boba tea house in lv. my only downside, if any, is that the location is somewhat far from the strip  maybe a 1015 min drive.
our first experience at brew tea was outstanding! after seeing our friends go through 6 punch cards standard buy 10 get one free, we knew we had to stop by. when we entered the really nice cashier explained the entire menu to us! we ordered the regular size i think it was 16oz and i believe the large was 20oz coldbrew coffee with seasalt foam and a hokkaido milk tea. the coldbrew was just sweet enough and had a unique flavor i have not seen at any other coffee place. i wish it was easier to find on the menu, though. we had to ask about it by name. we included the seasalt foam on top of the hokkaido milk tea as well. the flavor was amazing and it had a perfectly creamy texture; however, wed probably order it a little less sweet next time. halfway through our drinks we knew we had to order a berry lover crepe with green tea ice cream. if youve had an asianstyle dessert crepe at any other place like crepe shack they are very similar. a perfect amount of nutella complimented the ice cream and tart berries. they also have wifi, but only a few tables so i dont think it would be the perfect place to study in the evenings. overall, a must try.
best jasmine tea latte with sea salt! mmmmm! my new fave! and their crepes are awesome! service is quick too! cute and clean place
i love how caring and welcoming all the employees are! im a thai tea addict and their thai tea is absolutely amazing. their drinks are a1 and my boyfriend absolutely loves the hokkaido! my staple tea place for sure.
honey boba rocks my world!i did a search on yelp one day at work to see which boba place was the closest and thats how i discovered this place. its now become a weekly visit to get my boba fix. the milk teas are my favorite and they can even be a meal replacement for my quick lunches. they are creamy, sweet and full of flavor, especially if you add things to them like honey boba and the newly discovered sea salt cream which took my drink to the next level. it all may sound a little weird but its not and everything works so beautifully together creating a very luxurious tea time experience. the folks who work here are super nice and greet everyone immediately as they step in and they even have a rewards card! buy 10 teas and get 1 free. this is a really nice touch! my favorite drink is the hokkaido tastes like milk  honey, and they also have a great thai tea, oolong, matcha, jasmine and almond. lots of great choices  the only one that was too strong for me was the rose milk tea. the tea house itself is tiny and super contemporary. i love its charm and ive become a regular here. looking forward to experimenting with more options and trying more flavors.
great customer service and the best boba in vegas hands down!!! drinks are alway consistent and on point.
awesome boba in southwest vegas, and yes i would dare say... all of las vegas!! what makes them special?the sea salt foam on their lattes. honey sweetened boba.friendly and helpful service.egg custardsmokey oolongfresh brewed teai could probably go on, but i think you get the point. check it out and you will not be disappointed.... well really, if you are, they will modifyremake it for you :
obsessed with this place!  most boba places now a days seem to have lost the concept of making really good boba drinks.  their boba is not too sweet and their drinks are unique.i live in summerlin and i go here at least twice a week for my fix.  i get an iced black tea latte, with almond milk,  sea salt cream.  may sound odd but its delicious.  some times i get a strange look when i order it  usually say the way juliens mom gets it  theyll know what im talking about lol.  i also get a large cold brew with sea salt cream on the side and take it home to drink in the mornings until i run out and have an excuse to go back a couple days later.my brother gets the hokkaido milk tea which is also really good.  i have nothing negative to say about this place!
amazing boba!!!! best one ive had in a long time! delish matcha tea with boba yum! the owner came out and greeted everyone! very nice and i will definitely return!
i got the okinawa milk tea and it was delicious!! similar to their brew tea but made with brown sugar this place was a little pricey for not very large sizes. it was some of the best milk tea i have had though so i definitely recommend this place.
this is the best boba place and the boba is very soft and chewy! i am not a taro fan, but i definitely would order their taro milk tea because its made from real taro and it tasted sooooo good! the owner was also nice enough to upgrade our drinks for free because we told are him we are new visitors. i will definitely come here again when i am in town!
beautiful  cozy tea bar! the drinks were really good; their crepes smelled amazing but we were too full by the time we got here. i got oolong latte w sea salt creme  honey boba; my bf got hokkaido milk tea with honey boba  both were delicious! the sea salt creme  honey boba are what makes this tea place so special in my opinion. shared parking lot with other businesses. theres a punch card available. adjust the sweetness of your drinks to your liking when ordering. super friendly service.
my fiance always stops by here to grab me a boba milk tea and grab himself a taro smoothie. love the fresh scoop of taro in it ! the owner always remembers my fiance and is very humble and thanks my fiance for the support of his business. our new boba spot :
came here for the first time on 1228 and order the taro milk tea with boba and it was hands down the best taro milk tea i have ever tasted. the staff was super friendly and even told me that if any adjustments had to be made that they could fix it for us. i think i just found my favorite boba place
some of the best tea and boba ive had in a while . new favorite spot . super friendly staff
awesome place! great customer service! if your not happy w what you order they will make you a new one! just moved out here from la where theres boba everywhere....this is definitely my new boba spot!
i go here almost every day, maybe twice a day. love the place, the workers are ausome. if my 5 year old loves it , they are doing something right!!!
this is by far the most amazing boba tea restaurant that i have ever been to! my fiance and i have tried nearly all of their boba teas and have yet to be unimpressed! they are extremely friendly and customer service oriented and will even make you a new boba tea if you do not like the one that you ordered! they have crapes as well which are an amazing breakfast if you are looking for something sweet in the morning! highly recommended!
a quaint little shop with amazing staff and even more amazing beverages!  i had the lychee peachy tea with boba, which satisfied both my sweet tooth and my thirst.  and then, opted for the berry lovers crepe which was hot, had tons of fresh berries and just the right amount of smooth nutella and whipped cream to balance the textures.  perfect place to go with friends or by yourself if you prefer with seating both inside and out.  i will definitely be going back!
just purchased the cocoberry and im blown away on how good the slush is. definitely just stumbled on a gem
the sea salt cream is truly what sets this place from the other boba places in the vegas area.
i had been hearing about this place for the longest time and have gone here now, a billion times! i am only now getting to write a review. i wanted to kick my expensive starbucks coffee once a day habit but now i have found another place that will take my money everyday haha the first time i had gone here, they ask you if you have ever been there  they then start to give you recommendations based on your personal preferences on what you like and dont like. they also had this if you dont like it, well make you another drink np policy. after some experimenting, i found my drink. i came across it because this girl had a peculiar looking drink in her hand and i had to be nosey and asked her about it. black tea latte yall! at first, i was skeptical, because i didnt know what to think about the whole tea and latte mix? when you first get it, it comes out separated and i guess thats how youre supposed to drink it  layered and all. but i personally like to mix it with my straw and i also get no boba. im not a big fan of the tapioca balls but the ones here are pretty good. ive also had the black tea latte with pudding  excellent, sunrise slush  pretty good, oolong tea latte  pretty good....pretty much everything here is pretty good. the staff is always wayyyyyy too nice. theyre so friendly, always smiling! :d
i yelped bubble tea in las vegas just for fun, and lo and behold brew tea bar! was surprised to see a five star bubble tea shop not sure if one even exists back home, but yelp didnt disappoint. ill start by saying my jasmine latte hot with sea salt cream and pearls was probably one of the best bubble teas ive had, ever, if not the best. one of my companions ordered the taro milk tea hot and declared it the best bubble tea shed ever had. i took a sip and wow  fresh taro and perfect amount of sweetness and richness. bubbles cooked to perfection. third in our party ordered mango latte cold with pearls. he said it was really good as well but i didnt actually get around to trying it. next time!the tea itself is worthy of 5 stars. however, theres 2 more things to rave about! 1 the store, while small, is welcoming, clean, and you get a good vibe the second you walk in the door. its not loud and tacky and crushed with people i went at 2pm on tuesday. although the is not really a big factor for me when buying bubble tea, brew tea bar was probably offered the most pleasant ordering experience and general environment of all the bubble tea shops ive been to yes, lots of superlatives in this review, but welldeserved i assure you. 2 perhaps most importantly, or at least equally as important as the taste of the tea itself, the staff are serious about customer service. i witnessed a customer a regular, maybe  he seemed on friendly terms with the staff sip his drink and proceed to request that the teasugar ratio be adjusted. the person behind the counter happily dumped some of the drink and added more tea to reduce the sweetness. he then waited for the customer to sip again and nod with satisfaction. a minute after paying for my order, one staff member came over and addressed me by name, just looking to confirm that we actually wanted strawberry latte hot. she explained it was doable but probably wouldnt be the best choice for a hot drink, so we ended up switching to something else. lord knows how she knew my name  i was sort of surprised in the moment but realised she must have looked at my credit card. once the drinks arrived, another staff member personally delivered them to our table rather than shouting out the order or just leaving it on the counter as is standard practice at many other bubble tea shops. he also told us to try our drinks  he waited while we did so  and asked us how we liked them and if they needed any adjustments. whaaaaaa???? by this point, i was beyond impressed. 15 and some change for 3 delicious teas. approx. 12 min drive from the strip, but absolutely worth it. my only disappointment was that they would be closed by 10pm and we had a show that ended at 9:30pm, meaning i wouldnt be able to go back and try something else. all the better, as drinking two bubble teas in one day is decadent.  a store that truly values the customer experience and gets it right in all the most important, albeit small, details. high recommend.
absolutely  my new fav booba drink in all of lv. the matcha is my fav but overall their boobas are all so good!
excellent customer service. perfectly willing to accommodate strange requests. went above and beyond expectations. probably the best ive had in las vegas! came with katherine orta, who is apparently a regular. the guy who helped me was louis! very helpful, super friendly! will definitely come again!
i would vote for this place as best tea place in vegas.  their hokkaido with crema taste nothing like no other place can compare.  i wish thwy have a store in sf bay area.  the mango latte is one of a kind too.  this is my to go place everytime i visit vegas now
so happy to have a crepe place by the house! crepes, tea and boba all mean a frequent stopping place for our family. the service is really wonderful here, very friendly, welcoming and attentive. my son and i stopped in one day while waiting to get his haircut and enjoyed some boba almond milk and a nutella crepe. my son is always wanting to stop here so this was a treat for him. they do have a limited crepe menu so i cant wait till they expand their crepe menu. they are fresh and delicious. we will be back!
the okinawa w no boba... amazing. reminds me a bit of golden grahams, in the best way possible. love it!
ive had a lot of boba around california. i can honestly say this is the best boba ive ever had. the sea salt foamcreme is some next level innovation. i tried their mango latte and hokkaido milk tea, both were absolutely amazing. the ones boba is also great. just the right amount of chewiness and sweetness. whatever you get, be sure to get sea salt foam. to every other boba place: step up your game.
alright, im going to make this short and simple: this place is absolutely amazing and my go to boba spot in vegas! service is prompt, drinks seem to always be spot on, crepes are delicious, and the workers are extremely friendly and welcoming. its a bit far from where i live but i wouldnt mind driving 2030 minutes to make a stop here and grab myself a drink. i definitely recommend the hokkaido milk tea with boba, its extremely savory lol. they have some pretty unique things on their menu that you wouldnt find at any other locations. you should definitely try the drinks and crepes here, theyre worth every penny :
this is my go to spot when im craving teas, slushes or boba! not only is this the best teahouse in town but the staffs are really friendly and helpful plus they have stamp cards!
small yet cozy tea spot. boba is perfect not too chewy and doesnt get hard after hitting the ice. almond milk tea was delicious. salt cream was interesting mix in to the oolong tea. and the taro smoothie was perfect topped with real taro.
ahhhmazing!! the absolute best and honest customer service ive ever received from a locksmith!! not only did he fully explain the pricing but once he opened the car door there was no surprise surcharges.. super fast and extremely affordable service... i hope to never lock my keys again, but if i ever do need a locksmith rj is my guysuper surprised there isnt a ton of 5star reviews btw!!.... thanks again, god bless!!
locked out of the house and he came as soon as he could to help! very friendly and got the job done without destroying the lock. definitely the person to call if you are in a tight situation!
rick rekeyed some locks.  he was very personable, efficient and reasonably priced.  i respected his integrity and taking time to make sure everything was done correctly.  i highly recommend him and would definitely use him again.
thank you rick, rj locksmith for your work at our office.  we also refer rick to our clients.  we know that he is trustworthy and does great work.  we referred a client that was broken in to at move in.  it was in the late afternoon and across town.  rick got in his car, with traffic, and was there to secure our clients home.  at a great price. it is good to know our referral will be taken care of.
rick is completely trustworthy and will bend over backwards to help in any way he can. i have utilized his services twice now and will not ever use anyone else!!!
i love these guys, this is the second time i have used them for two commercial locations i have purchased and rick was able to figure out the spaghetti mess and reduce the number of keys while giving me the flexibility i needed with the master.the other think i liked about the service is he never says not today, or make you wait, he has twice now fitted me in his busy schedule, even though he had to drive back to scottsdale from phoenix for my small job.i was also impressed that he did not try up charge as many of the bait as switch ads do, like a  15 service fee, 10 pulling in the driveway fee, 10 to open a truck sliding door fee....  his prices were exactly as he quoted me and no surprises.  he just seems like a normal honest hardworking guy building a business the old fashion way.i will use rick at rj locksmith for my next purchase for sure.
tiffany is the best! ive been seeing her for couple months and i love the way she does my nails and i also love the fact that my nails are so strong even tho i have gel polish. so i figured that other places may have been using cheap materials. very clean salon and friendly staff.
im very happy everyone is speaking english, very clean , good music. i didnt have to wait in pedicure tub for 2 hours just  my soaking feet. no one was answering the phone speaking another language. i actually saw staff cleaning the pedi tubs when done working. professional manicurist with strip style knowledge. i work on strip and i can tell people care here. thank god i found this nail salon.
awesome nail salon. super clean with great customer service. my gels last forever! great music too :
totally tiffany nails is amazing!!! everything and everyone one is so bright and beautiful. i am welcomed with smiles, coffee and great service. they all do an amazing job!!!

its been 3 weeks  not a single chip in my gel manicure!  i purposely waited to write a review so it can be based on my overall experience and quality of the products used.  ive never been able to last more than 2 weeks without at least 1 of my nails chipping or lifting on the ends my previous nail techs always told me it was because of my oily nail beds?.  this place is super clean and all employees were very friendly.  im not sure what tiffany did on my gel manicure that was so different from the 10 other places ive tried but im extremely happy i finally found someone who can make my gel mani last for at least 3 weeks :
i really love the staff here! they do a great job and are all very attentive and polite! tip: if you want a polish color that they dont have, let tiffany know and she will buy it for your next visit.
i love this neighborhood nails salon.  owner tiffany she is always pleasant and helpful.  anna is my goto nail technologist, her work is always perfect and meticulous.  even thou i moved 15 miles away i still travel back to have my nails done every month.  my only go to nails salon.
awesome place to do your own auto repairs. the owner is a great guy and also very knowledgeable in auto repairs. i did my shocks and when i got stuck he helped me out. the shop has all the tools you could possibly need to do a quick project.  also computers to check torque specs and all.
finally we have a diy shop here in las vegas.  they save so much money having the lifts and tools to do pretty much any job, big or small.  no more paying dealership prices or gambling with the shady chain stores in the valley. do it yourself, and do it right.  advantages: staying out of the weather, not having to crawl around on the 500 degree concretenot having to deal with chain shops trying to sell you 2k of work that you probably dont need, when you came in for an oil change  tire rotationknowing exactly what parts are used in the repair. .no tool investment needed! they provide a pretty complete tool set to do pretty much any job you might have to do.  from oil changes to engine replacement.friendly help and advice.  the owner has experience with all kinds of cars, japanese, european, domestic and exotics.no more asking friends for last minute rides to get a tool because you tore halfway into the project and then realized you dont have the right tool to actually finish the job.  go check it out.  save yourself the time, money, and frustration.  if you like working on cars, youll be glad you did.
i went out to vegas for a drift event and broke a control arm and messed up a few other suspension arm parts, not being a local it would have been horrible trying to repair s14 in the 100 degree heat on the ground outside a friends house.  instead i had the car towed and it was awesome having a lift and tools available and i was able to diagnose and replace what i needed to get the car moving again.  i was in an out in a few hours and on my way home.  i really appreciate the help jordan!
no more being annoyed by shifty work performed by professional mechanics. save yourself the hassle and some dollars and try fixing your automobile yourself. on top of being clean and very organized, this shop has everything you can think of and some things you never thought youd need :. jordan the owner is patient, knowledgeable and willing to lend a hand if need be. great place to spend time!
brought my 04 acura tl to fix the stripped out oil pan that was stripped by the dealer.  awesome.jordan was really helpful, especially when it got to the part where i usually go look for a really big hammer, he helped me figure out how to get the exhaust jpipe back on without brute force.  took about 4 hours of work about 451hr was waiting for it to cool off an waiting for the sealant to set and it was still about 13 of what local shops wanted to charge me for the same repair. its also great not having to worry if i brought the right tools since they stock pretty much any tool you might need, and consumables like brake cleaner  offering oil disposalnow i can finally catch up with all of the maintenance ive been putting off.  the fans inside the shop are actually really good at keeping the shop cool as well.  that was a pleasant surprise
where should i start...went to the mall for someting  cant even remember . parked n walked through an entrance  i never use . what do i see  fantastic embroidery, i walked in asked if the file needs to be in a .dst  formatt and the guy said no, told him i have the business card. they took the card, the pour coffeehouse logo. made a test  setup... perfectly awesome! had 2 baseball hats made! love them and so does everyone else. thank you for the fantastic work and great service from you all!!
i called ahead of time to make sure they did what i needed and from the moment they answer very polite and helpful lady! gave me great directions and made it right in ! they finished my jackets within one our, and they are exactly as they showed me and colors are exact! im impressed by their work and customer service and their prices are very reasonable! thank you very much!
been online looking for a place to make one patch without the expensive setup fee. it was a blessing that i found this place. the work was awesome and it was done by the time i got there. i will definitely come back to get some more done and refer people that needs some embroidery done.
located at the former terribles casinobowling alley location boulder hwy  major, 89015 la v villita casino is a great place to gamble and eat fresh mexican food.the clerk behind the counter was friendly made us feel welcome right away and we stayed there for 2 hours enjoying fresh chicken tacos food prices are very affordable and the slot machines are loose i won 67.00 after putting a 5 dollar bill in my first slot machine i plan to go back here weekly only 10 minutes from my home great place to enjoy a drink and food with friends.diamond has left to bad she was great but jamie does a great job all races are welcome there are some people who think just because you waited for a drink or werent greeted right away your fair skin wasnt welcomewrong! all are welcome i won over 200.00 last week yahoo!
wonderfully light cookies, perfect with coffee and dessert.  beautiful english pound cake.  a delightful spot.
i just visited the newly reopened strawberry fields and i must say that i am impressed! i will preface this with saying that the new strawberry fields is much different than the old business. i think that almost all the improvements are positive ones but if you were head over heels in love with the old strawberry fields, you might want to read this whole review before you decide to go back. also, the employees are obviously all new so, i noticed that many of them are a little confused with pricing of products and logistics but it wasnt bad enough to ruin my experience.many of the important features of the old strawberry fields are still there. they still have freshly baked bread and vegan desserts. they still carry a lot of vegetarian frozen items and have a similarly sized produce section. they also carry a lot of the same natural brands like annies and amys that many old customers are probably familiar with. they also still have coffee drinks available and a sizable bulk section.there are a few things that are different. i consider most of these things positive improvements. the biggest positive improvement for me is the little food counter where they now serve coffee. it looks like they have a really great lunch special and i cant wait to come back for lunch! i tried out the eggplant salad which i would describe as a cold casserole, was super yummy! it was creamy and had great herb and garlic flavor! i will definitely come back to try other things they have behind the counter. this is also where they have some of their vegan desserts available. i even saw sugar free cookies! although the flavor was something with molasses so i would probably ask if they are actually diabetic friendly or if they just dont have granulated sugar. i decided to go for a piece of chocolate cake. it was so tasty and super rich! another big improvement is that they have an olive bar over by the cheeses! the only bad change is that they now put groceries in plastic bags and they dont have those snazzy bags that say being green is our bag. thats okay, i almost always bring my own bag anyway.all in all, i would say its similar to the old location with a more international twist and an awesome spot to grab a quick meal! you can guarantee that ill be a regular!
i went today for the first time...amazing remodeled space!  the cafe is back and the food looks delicious!  theres a ton of variety of different things.  its bigger than the coop, and has a lot of potential over it with having the cafe.  im so sick of the same old thing at the coop.  the prices for some things are too high to be feasible eg milk but they have an olive bar, bakery, and cheese case.  i thing they should have the same cheese in this location as world harvest.  i dont know if they have a coffee bar....so happy that theyre back!
i love the new store!  i shopped every once in awhile at the old version, and it was ok  prices were higher than id have like on a few items, and the store always struck me as cramped, disorganized and dirty.  while the prices are still on the higher end for some thing at the new store more on that later the remodel is beautiful, with lots of natural light, and the store feels open and airy.  the best part is the cafe!  i had a great latte, some amazing lunch specifically the falafel and the broccoli salad, and some french macarons.  everything was delicious.  regarding the prices, i spoke with the owner who said he is working very hard to lower the prices.  so if you visited and found them too high, go back in a month. maybe theyll be lowered!
ive stopped in a couple times since they reopened under new management. very happy to see what used to be several aisles of vitamins has been transformed into a neat little deli. i had the chicken along with one pasta side and a veggie side and everything was so tasty and reasonable pricing for lunch. i will definitely add this to my list of places to go for lunch.i picked up some things from the bulk section and fresh baked bread.next time will have to look into their desserts and coffee.
great service!
i went there yesterday to got my nails done, it was great, love the place, very clean and nice. great service! the tech took her time to did my nails, she was very friendly! definitely will come back!
very nice, friendly and clean atmosphere. i totally appreciate the plastic liners for the spa tub. ill definitely be back because my nails and feet look fabulous!!!
i did a walk in for a gel fill and pedicure and got serviced straight away. the salon is very clean and the owner played very pleasant relaxing music. best nail design ive ever had and very reasonable prices! this is my new place to go from now on.
really like this new cute salon. one of the former employees of polished nails opened it and the services are the same but cheaper prices. plus the owner is adorable. very happy with my experiences so far

sara shertz and gun play vegas is the only venue that i would consider when going for further handgun and rifle tactical training. they were highly recommended to me by my law enforcement colleagues when it was necessary for me to obtain my concealed carry permit for nevada. i was appointed by the governor as a criminal court judge in 1990 and have sentenced thousands of habitual violent offenders to hard core prison. it is imperative that i am extremely proficient in firearms safety and proper self defense.  sara shertz taught me tactical responses that i had not learned from my respective police academies where i taught and from many days training with my seal team friends and law enforcement colleagues. sara is a thoughtful, intelligent, tough, well trained, articulate firearms instructor .... and in my mind  the very best. sara even was able to advise me as to how to expedite my successful receipt of my nevada ccw in the most timely and proper manner. i am grateful and blessed to have been trained by the best!
sara not only taught us how to shoot, she found us the right equipment and helped us develop a comprehensive home defense plan.  my wife was especially apprehensive about handling a firearm, sara was able to assuage any apprehension with education and detailed training.  i would highly recommend gun play vegas, its a professional organization with very experienced people.
as a selfprofessed gunaphobe, this was a training that i didnt necessarily want to go through. but after being urged by my husband, i can say i feel so much empowerment and confidence around our firearm and home security. sara was incredible. totally understood my hesitance and reassured me a 100 times over about the safety features of our gun, taught me how to hold, shoot, check for bullets in a very patient and professional manner. went through our home and gave us a game plan in case we were to ever have a worst case scenario.  shes an awesome educator, instructor and shooting mentor. she is very informative about gun safety with children and is designing a program geared towards child safety if they were to ever come across a gun on their ownwhich as a parent, is supremely important to me. i highly recommend gun play vegas!
if you are considering getting your ccw, training with your firearm or are completely new to shooting you need to train with gun play.  sara the owner is extremely knowledgeable and approachable about the whole process.  i am thoroughly impressed with how much i learned in such a short period of time.  i worked with sara to obtain my ccw in 2013, then for one on one training with my new glock 19 in 2014 and again for a group pistol course this year.  the ccw process was very informative, learning about when and where i cancannot carry and the ramifications of doing so.  she goes over the legal information in detail and firearm fundamentals that other ccw classes i looked into do not teach how to draw, how to use barricades, shooting while moving, etc..  she is super knowledgeable about gun, holster and safety recommendations and can get her students guns and ammo at a deep discount through some of her partners, which is another perk of training with her.  training one on one with her helped me feel more confident with my firearm she had so many tips about improving my accuracy and pushing my speed and i can honestly say i improved as a shooter ten fold.  if you are new to shooting, i can say with confidence that sara at gun play will make you feel at ease.highly recommend gun play vegas!
gun play vegas, run by sara shertz, is a great place for firearms instruction.whether you want to learn the basics of how to shoot a firearm for the first time before making a purchase, or are a long time shooter looking to sharpen your skills, sara has the patience and expertise to help you.my wife was scared to hold a handgun or go to a range before working with sara, now she is comfortable with the handgun she purchased recommended by sara and enjoys going to the range to practice with me on a regular basis. highly recommend you use sara shertz and gun play vegas for any of your individual or group instructional needs, she is the best!
this is the coolest little pop up coffee bar! each offering on the menu is original and delicious. ive ordered a tres mexicanos, a mexican mocha with a cinnamon kick. amazing! i would love to be able to hire tres leches for my next event although im not sure if they offer catering just yet. this brand is definitely one to watch!
i was never much of a coffee drinker until i came across tres leches cafe. every drink i try is delicious. they are so good you will want to buy 2 coffees back to back!
the barista is like the friendliest guy in the world. smoothie was absolutely delicious and i usually dont like iced coffee but this guy makes it right! i love this place.
uhhh holy shit that was delicious. i think i got a dulce de tres leches.. not sure so good i didnt think, just drank.
open 7 days a week now! yelp will update their open hrs info soon, hopefully. first visit today: started with basics: cafe con tres leches! yummmy!!! will come back to try entire menu! now easier, since theyre open everday! :
i tried this place today the first time. was first a little hard to find because its inside an other store. but as soon as i got in, everyone was really friendly, nice and helpful. i had a white chocolate pumpkin latte. it was really good. i will definitely come back to try other coffees.
wow!stopped by scotts generations on the way back from an errand and got my usual bagels etc, and turned around and there is this new cafe right inside the store! i tried a decaf latte i only drink decaf and many small coffee places do not even serve decaf! so already thrilled! the price is good 4 for a nice big cup and the coffee was the best tasting i have had in ages! wish i lived closer, i would be going here all the time! but i cannot wait to be passing by there again i will for sure load up on more bagels at scotts and get my yummy decaf latte again!
excellent place to have breakfast! good prices and choices. nice atmosphere and clean place! try to get early to avoid lines.
first time here and it was excellent! great food, fast friendly service and your coffee cup was always full. we will definitely be back.
always great  consistent and tasty. same owners as jacks in st. jacobs. they are always busy, but its a good sign! the only pet peeve i have is that when i order a sandwich like a blt, the mayo dressing is always on the side!! why cant the cooks put it on there? so dumb... nonetheless, its good food, great service, and we are recurring customers. my husband loves it so much, we sometimes go twice in a week! recommended dishes: protein skillet, smoothies, hashbrowns...anything!
i just had my soupsubwater delivered to me and wow!  it was here with in 15 minutes!!!  i had the minnesota wild rice soup and the flash sub and both were delicious!
i read some of the old reviews that said the salon was disappointing, but my experience was terrific!i was greeted warmly and led to a spa chair in this very clean and up to date salon.i chose my colors and was treated to an excellent pedicure that culminated in a hot stone foot massage.then i was directed to a manicure table where, she gave me one of the best manicures ive had in years. first adam nails  spa ,.914 e camelback rd  7, phoenix, az 85014                                      phone number 602 2747979 if youre looking for real gel nails, look no farther! take it from someone that has tried just about everywhere else you will not go wrong here.  second i have scoured the salons across central and north phoenix and everyone of them i have left let down with my experience andor my nails. this is the first time i have left a salon in phoenix with none of those thoughts. i was explained everything up front, the price and my options. i was given advice on how i should proceed on the condition of my nails, not how it would profit the salon. that alone is worth a five star review in my eyes. there wasnt any feeling like i was being talked about or judged by any of the techs everyone was happy and in good spirits. there was conversation back and forth and i instantly felt comfortable and part of the pretty little nails family. third, this place is spotless i was asking questions about how they keep everything clean. during my hour and 20 minute appointment i watched clean a good times, mine took longer cause she had to fix what another salon did to my nails: trust me you are never going to catch one of those weird infections from this place.
just came to grand opening for triple 2s tavern. the food was really great, burgers were cooked to perfection and the wings were excellent too. kid friendly during the day and a big difference from the original barrestaurant it used to be. owner was very engaged wanting to know what our experience was like ... will definitely be back again!
came here for the second time ever the other day and the adorable waitress with tattoos and long, pretty hair walked up to me with a sweet smile and confirmed that i wanted a margarita on the rocks.  i was in utter disbelief that she remembered my drink order from the one other time id been in, a couple of weeks prior, but i guess somehow she did.  plus the margarita was delicious, and perfectly mixed.  very impressive service!
i have to say this place is awesome. went there for lunch on sunday and even with the  nfl starting back ashley  hope thats spelled correctly ash  service never suffered.great pretzels and cheese sticks for app. wife had a pizza she said it was awesome. i had the steak sandwich. it was awesome. its a diners, drive in and dives place.oh and the beer prices are awesome... highly highly suggest visiting we will be back many more times for sure..
the best thing about triple 2s is the staff. but the bar food staples, pizza and wings well they cant be beat. i have had about the entire menu and it is not just thrown together like most bar food. 4 apps are a great deal like the fried pickles etc. if you live close this should be your hangout.
this place has changed its name so many times, but one thing remains...they have tasty bar food. we ordered pizza slices, mozarella sticks during hh and they were so greasy good lol and cheap! i ordered a shrimp poboy and it didnt disappoint. the food is greasy, beer cold, and lots of tvs for all types of sporting events. staff is friendly. outdoor patio seating and smoking area, along with bag toss. its definetly a sports barpub atmosphere, so expect casual atmosphere and cheers!
great service from a cute waitress.  i was there to watch a bowl game and they fired it up for me with audio and everything.  fun environment and great food and staff.
absolutely delicious!!   my waitress was awesome! will never go to olive garden again.   not only was their thin crust pizza just taste bud popping good but their pasta was to die for.   was so impressed!!  we god dessert too.   the restaurant is a bit small for being as packed as it was.   we did have a 45 min wait but was worth it.   we were so satisfied with our dishes and service from our waitress,  we gave a 30 tip.   we got 2 appetizers 2 pasta entres a 12 pizza 2 drinks and cookie dough dessert.  total bill was 78.   great news for military they have 20 discount.   so bill came to 65.     and yes it was just me and my husband and no we didnt eat everything lol!!   we sampled all the entres and had everything but dessert in togo boxes p     jfyi though..  portions of the food are pretty big sizes.    enjoy!!
we come here a lot...and keep coming back except last time we waited about 50 minutes for a salad and diablo shrimp...was around 2 pm on a monday.  diablo shrimpmeatballs and angel hairlasagnaits all great.
try the garlic knots  you wont regret it!  the new york style pizza was delicious and we also enjoyed the bbq wings.  the menu had a variety of calzones and subswell be coming back to try more.
this is the second time i have eaten here and it is good food. their deep dish pie is called sicilian  , mine was a hawaiian with artichoke. topping cover the hole pie, crust is crunchy all the way through,. don the son, who i believe the restaurant is named after,  cook my pie in front of me. very nice, and prides himself in putting out a good product. this is a family run pizza joint, i have met his mom, father, uncle and sister.  all of whom have been great. it has a  clean and nice atmosphere. if you have not tried this place, i highly recommend it, you wont be disappointed.
i just had the lasagna it comes with 4 garlic knots and a salad, it was really really good. once again i have not been disappointed, the staff is really nice and considerate. more and more people are coming in.
tried it for the first time being right around the corner from my house. loved it, great pizza and friendly staff
this place is amazing.  good fresh food. great people and they deliver to their neighbors.
we ordered wings, pizza and garlic knots. everything was very good! the bbq on the wings was a bit sweet and tangy... different but good! the knots were hot and pull apart soft. would recommend.
went to dons for the first time tonight. we got a xlarge cheese pizza, chicken parm sandwich, meatball parm sandwich and chicken piccata dinner. everything was delicious. its a taste of new york. they are from brooklyn, the best city in the world. maybe i am biased because i am too. we tried a bunch of different dishes and each one was terrific. cant wait to go back and try the chicken francese dinner, calzone, chicken alfredo and cheese cake. welcome to the neighborhood!
i loved this pizza!!! good pizza places are hard to find on this side of town so im glad i found one ! they have really good ny style pizza. their crust is nice and chewy and the sauce very flavorful. we ordered the margarita  pizza.... the cheese was so good. definitely tasted homemade. my only complaint was that the sauce was a little runny, but it was very flavorful. my new pizza place!
ive tried several items over the past weeks, and wow!i recommend the pizza rolls or the cheese steaks
was told to give this place a try. i ordered a ny supreme pizza and 48 wings. picked it up and toon it home. it was one of the best pizzas ive had i a long time. fresh cheese meat and the vegetables on the pizza where cooked. the wings where great also. crispy with a ton of sauce.  their ranch that came with the wings was amazing. its not your normal ranch. it had some type of garlic powder in it. delicious. i will be back.
yelp you did it again. my wife and i had rough days and then you gave me a notice of new restaurants in the area and we found this gem. pizza and wigs were amazing and they were so friendly and accommodating to our young family. we will be back!
first time visiting today.  got take out.  manicotti for the wife and chicken parm for me.  figured those were staples that every italian restaurant should be able to do well.  let me just say, they far exceeded my expectations! the accompanying salad and garlic bread knots were equally delicious! i will definitely be returning here in very near future!  the atmosphere was casual, the restaurant was very clean and the employees very polite, courteous and seemed enthused to be there.
best food on the west side!  every time weve eaten there, the food is delicious.  pizza, subs,  calzones, outstanding!  the price, a little on the high side, the quality of the food makes it worth it. give the place a try.
really great place that stays open till ten pm on weekdays nights . family owned and really friendly and great customer service . came for the pizza which is really good i suggest the buffaloe chicken pizza but i also tried the spicy chicken alfredo and it was one of the best pats dishes ive had att any restaraunt in arizona . been back many times and have loved everything ive tried . the wings calzones and other dishes are well worth it !! a must visit
classic hair and makeup is a brand new salon in south side flats. it is beautiful, very clean and very friendly service. the prices are comparable and very affordable. the stylists are awesome. kim has been my stylist for 12 years. she is amazing with color, style and cuts. she is very creative and makes you look beautiful.
kim did a great job with my highlights balayage and my haircut as always.  the salon is beautiful  a very elegant space, and very relaxing.  planning to bring my kids, too, because the prices are so reasonable for them!
normally i am a sergios regular.  ive been there so many times that they know my name and that i never want the same style twice.  unfortunately last time i went, it was a new stylist because the other 2 or so have all left to pursue their own paths.  the new stylist lacked creativity... so i thought id try something new.i heard about this new salon opening in the southside where the girls knew their color  there was even mermaid hair on one of the girls working there!  so i figured id try it.my stylist kim accepted my open to anything challenge and  wow!  i feel like me again!  an edgy cut with a stellar color of mahogany and red  100 me.  the new salon was pretty slick too  modern yet classic.  there was an older woman there getting just a trim and me with my crazy color.  needless to say they can handle pretty much anything.congratulations to kim and the classic hair  make up crew  youve won me over.  prepare to see a lot more of me.
absolutely love classic hair and makeup! ive been getting my hair cut by kristi for five years, even when i lived in california they do the absolute best haircuts and styling  im having actually having my hair and makeup done for my wedding by classic hair and makeup!
best hair cut ive ever received. i get compliments daily. sometimes from people i know, but mostly from total strangers. its like, i thought i was good looking before, but now... now i know.  thanks, classic! thanks, kristi!
we know these ladies from a former salon, its usually very easy to get an appointment, they are always smiling  friendly. most importantly they do a fabulous job, very talented at all levels whether cut  color, up dos, or mens haircuts.
highly recommend mary at classic hair and makeup salon at the southside flats.  she gave me fantastic blonde highlights and awesome haircut.  the salon is gorgeous and has the most comfortable chairs and soothing shampoo chair.  great atmosphere very friendly!
ive never been to classic hair and makeup before today. i go to my regular hair stylist 45 minutes south of the city but i couldnt get an appointment when i needed it, so after a quick yelp search i decided to give this place a try.      i was really happy with the results. i had the girl with the purple hair i forgot the name, sorry!. i really love the decor. for a cut and color i paid 105...which is more expensive than what im used to but i think the stylist did a great job...especially on the color. i also hate having a bunch of hair product in my hair, but my stylist used just the right amount.       bottom line, i loved my experience here and that its 10 minutes from my house. im thinking about making this my new goto salon although again...its just a little pricier than my regular place.
mary is a fantastic stylist!  i decided to stop dying my hair when i turned 50! i am now a natural salt and pepper. i was a tad bit concerned when i first met maryat another salon to cut my hair because she is very young! i did not want my hair styled like a teenager and i did not want to look like a frumpy fifty year old! mary listened to my concerns and style opinions, i even brought in pictures of specific cuts i liked. mary never rushes through my cut unless i am pressed for time!  she is fabulous. i leave her chair looking professional and stylish. she is supportive of my grey hair and complimentary of it! most importantly, my hair looks great weeks after her cuti am able to maintain and style it just like her! mature women, do not be intimidated going to this salon with all the fabulous young women reviews with their awesome color jobs...this salon is capable of making all ages look beautiful! my son gets his haircut by mary also. parking was not difficult. prices comparable to other city salons. they have a lovely salon with the most comfortable shampoo bowl i have ever experienced!
i was looking for a new salon in pittsburgh and happened to find a flyer for classic in a local coffee shop. i made an appointment and only researched the salon a few days before i went. i had really high expectations based on the reviews and i was not disappointed!the salon itself is a gorgeous space and all of the staff are friendly and welcoming. kim cut and styled my hair beautifully. i left having enjoyed the entire experience and made an appointment for color. i highly recommend this salon.
i highly recommend if you are looking for a home to rentbuy  contact dustin hayes. we had a wonderful experience! dustin was great in terms of finding us exactly what we wanted and closing the deal within just a few days. i only have great things to say and would recommend this agent to anyone.
i would 100 recommend dustin! i moved to az from tn not knowing anything about the area. he helped find me a house that was the perfect size in a great neighborhood! i would have been lost without him!
dustin is so great with his feedback and follow through. we havent purchased a home with him yet but working with him has been wonderful. hes very knowledgable about schools and neighborhoods and what will work best for you and your family. dustin is very conscientious and so nice and funny every time we chat or meet is a pleasure.
guys you need to get here. this spot has a bombing crepe cake. please see the picture i took. this thing is 30 layers of crepe with a creme filling in between each. please enjoy and feel the love put into making this thing. the ambiance is very clean and nice. the water is on point. i wouldnt have even thought of trying the water but they brought out a glass for me with my cake. its got cucumber and lemon in it, perfect for this ridiculous heat. go here, order cake, eat it. you are welcome.
i have been waiting for it for months. finally they open! i really like the green tea mille crepe! you guys need to come!
lady m finally opens in charlotte, fantastic crepe cake we tried green tea and chocolate, yum, delicate and not too sweet.  the place has just been opened for two weeks, still more deco need to be done, but already seems to have a interesting selection of wine and coffee drinks.  will be a good place for group gathering, or just chilling off with a laptop. cant wait to go back again...
beautiful art. beautiful presentation. this lovely gallery also serves one of the best almond milk lattes ive ever had. and, unlike most coffee houses these days, the gallery serves coffee in mug, not a paper cup. call me old school but i love getting my coffee in a real cup! the gallery also has assorted treats. i tried the checkered cake and it was delicious. there is also wine and beer. the staff is super nice, especially the manager emily. she consistently makes me feel special and offers me treats to try perfect for my cheat meal splurges : im happy to have them in the neighborhood.
first time at lady m and i am impressed. the crepes were delicious and the store has a hipster vibe to it. it would be a nice place to relax and chill with friends. the person working was really nice and delivered the desserts to us and even offered water. the water is super refreshing!
the gallery is a moldbreaker, and a fresh new addition to the south end neighborhood. charlotte is filled with many me too coffee and dessert shops, but no other place south end presents the gallerys truly unique point of view. part art gallery, part bakery, part wine bar, and part quiet brunch spot, the gallery mixes the best of all of these attributes with a clean, tasteful presentation, excellent service, exciting art, and delicious food. try their cakes for their best offering. the mille crepe cake is unlike anything ive ever seen, with dozens of petite layers of creme that are as much of a joy to look at as to eat. the coffee is stumptown, which is always a plus, and the wine has a decent variety. most surprising of all is the food, which has a delightful array of fresh sandwiches, perfect for a light lunch. the salmon sandwich is a favorite. the art is modern, curated from both the owners collection, and a variety of local artists, and lends a polished atmosphere to the place. the gallery is my new favorite place in the neighborhood and i hope it will be yours too!
everything you come into contact with is as delicious as is it elegant. the space is welcoming, bright and artful. the walls are covered with gorgeous original art that lends to the overall experience.  the savory selections are amazingly put together, fresh, sophisticated and delicious. but its the cake we love. the millicrepe cake is worth the trip alone.  delicate, just sweet enough and just plain ol wow! i prefer mine with champagne, which of course they have. and my husband loves the coffee. we always come for just a slice and feel so at home we end up staying much longer.i
20 layers in one cake? are you crazy?! nope, just brilliant. this place is delicious and their coffee is tasty too. oh, and its a very vibrant fun spot to workrelax.
great food, coffee, dessert! great service! and with a smile. just moved to charlotte and really enjoyed my experience here. my favorite place in town so far. and, the people are absolutely amazingthe owners, william and wife ana, made me feel like i was in there home and the staff is just incredible too. i absolutely loved it!  not to mention the food and coffee was great!!!
this hidden gem is almost too good to be true. this is the only place i known in charlotte, heck in n carolina, that carries stump town coffee. their breakfast croissant multigrain is top notch and comes out quick! quiet, clean and chic.
while wasting time before my. flight i found this place on yelp. loved the ambiance and the specially crepe cake. ill be back the next time im in town.
really cool older to hang out and meet friends. its quiet and stylish. the 20something layered crepe dessert is amazing. the green tea flavor is my favorite.
we were invited last night to help in preparation of their opening.  the pulled pork fries are amazing.  we also got the chicken garlic parmesan fries are they were also fantastic.  the restaurant is in a great location and im confident that it will do really well.  were looking forward to going back.
ffh or french fry heaven, is fantastic.  i love the new approach to an old favorite.  love the new loaded fries.  its a complete meal.  i eat the buffalo chicken loaded fries.  rocked my pallet.great concept.  love it, best of luck in tempe.  go devils.peter williamson
omg this is the best place on earth. i literally never thought fries could be this good, but they are a m a z i n g. some of the most delicious things my mouth has ever had the pleasure of tasting.
a must stop when in tempe!  the loaded spuds are fantastic but the sweet potato fries cant be beat!
ive been eating french fry heaven all over florida and i see now ill get a chance to get me some when i visit my office in tempe another reason to love my job. gotta start thinking of what ill be getting....pulled pork spuds with jalapenos if im real hungry or garlic parm fries with pink himalaya salt if im just jonesing for some tasty frites. mmmm. coming out there not soon enough!
love the fries topped with cheese and sour cream.  the cappuccino shake was really good too.  much better than mcdonalds shakes!
this place is awesome  i only wish that it had been there during my college years or maybe not! if you dont know the concept, its basically taking poutine to a whole new level! fresh cut french fries topped with your choice of toppings, which are all made in house. i was suspicious of the made fresh in house claim, especially the slow roasted pulled pork. but when i talked to the owner, he described how they do it all! i tried the pulled pork and jalapeno fries and the pork was super moist with lots of flavor! and the dessert fries were a perfect ending. light and airy like mini churros with a side of icing  yum!  i want to try the chicken tenders and country gravy fries next! gotta be better than the concoction i used to get at dennys! or any of the baked potatoes for a healthier option ha! parking in tempe can be a pain but there is a lot adjacent to the plaza for 1 per hour. not bad and actually convenient. i highly recommend this place for late night or casual lunch.  you can have a salad the next day...
i am in love! this place is amazing. i had the pulled pork with fries...absolutely loved it. the portions are huge and it is a full meal. cool idea!
french fry heaven is really good especially the buffalo fries and sunrise fries is a must try, though it is a little pricey but its good to spend a bit more when youre super hungry and you wanna eat food that makes you happy :
ive never had a bad experience at french fry heaven, and because i live nearby i go fairly frequently. i particularly like the chicken tenders  but i can vouch for the routine as well and, coming from a quebecois, i think i have good taste in poutine. the music is always a nice touch, too. im glad that ffh opened up for this year, and i hope it stays for a long time.
fries of my dreams! i was mildly hungover and wanted some deliciousness, so i came here. it was delicious. i got the buffalo and garlic parm chicken fries and they were excellent. smothered in sauce and cheese, fried chicken and good fries  it was absolutely everything i wanted! definite amazing place if you like fries, chicken, cheese and sauces. so many options though, good luck choosing just one!
i take the 7am monday class and love it! i am definitely a beginner  but they have so many options for me all the way to the pros : this is a fun way to switch up the usual work out and get sweaty! !
if youre looking for an average, run of the mill work out, with your everyday fitness trainer this is not a place you should go.             if youre looking for something extraordinary and actually fun, thats constantly changing and challenging, then youve found it. youll be pushed to your limits and beyond, youll laugh, youll sweat, youll make new friends, youll get addicted. its a work out and an environment that you just wont find at any gym in town.            you want results? david can give them to you. hes wonderful, hell giggle through your pain with you and when youre worked hard enough hell bring you a juice pouch while you lay on the floor... i mean... i dont wanna admit i laid on the floor like a big baby, but i did exactly that. and it was great.            bottom line is, if you want results, youll get them at extreme circus boot camp.
being able to do amazing things that you havent been able to do before, is an incredible feeling. i know because every time i come to class im learning something new. with the great instructors at this place, youll get in the best shape of your life, all while having fun. just about every athlete i know admires circus artist. well at extreme circus bootcamp you can literally train the same way they do and over time be an amazing athlete with awesome skills. every friend ive ever invited to try a class loves this place.
if you bored of trying to get fit with treadmills, cycling and same every week pilates classes, then you should definitely try extreme circus bootcamp!youll get a fun, full body workout with instructors who are friendly but will also give you the right amount of motivation so that you get the most out of your workout.i know that the name seems a little intimidating and you probably have visions of crazy circus acrobats doing death defying, crazy stunts to keep fit. to be honest, you may see some of that when you go but ecb is for all levels. the ecb instructors evaluate your fitness and ability in your first few classes and train you accordingly. so you will also learn some new skills as well as getting fit.  its not about showing off. there are no egos and no judging. just great group of people who encourage each other and all have the same goal of having a fit, strong and healthy lifestyle. also, if you are a vegas local, your first class is free. so what have you got to lose. give it a try.
awesome!  just plain awesome!  total body workout especially on those muscles you didnt know you had, but at a pace you can set for yourself.  circuit training mixed with learning things that you never thought you would have a chance to try.im fairly strong, but had concerns about flexibility walking into class.  people were really supportive and everyone had a different level of skill, so you quickly feel comfortable regardless of what you can do.  these classes are either great as the only workout  you do, or as an amazing supplement to anything else you do!
im new to this whole having a cat thing, however, between the three of them, cynthia, jen, and haley, they managed to turn my grumpy cat into an active, healthy, and happy pet! i usually go about once a month to stock up on goodies and they are always so helpful! you can really tell they love working together and most of all, love helping pet owners with all their pet needs! if youre looking for a place to shop local and natural, search no more!thanks ladies for always taking such good care of us!
the team at pet planet in tempe is simply amazing! they truly care about their customers  treat them like family. i look forward to seeing the pet of the day on their facebook, it always makes me smile. they also support several local nonprofit organizations which benefits the surrounding communities. i recommend purchasing a 5 coupon book, proceeds are going to local nonprofit  its full of freebies  discounts :

best pet food store in the valley. they take the time to find out what youre looking for and their knowledge of the products make me very comfortable trying new brands for my furry family members. the staff even take the time to follow up to make sure youre happy with your purchase. i recommend pet planet college park to all my pet owner friends,  and i love supporting local businesses.
my dog molly hates to take baths, so we only bathe her when we really have to. i heard about pet planets self wash and decided to give it a try. it was a lot easier on me and molly without the cost and hassle of a groomer. they had several different soaps and the water was the perfect temperature.we picked up a few bones and a squeaky toy and haley hooked us up with some treat samples as well. great service, friendly staff, and a clean, welllit store. well definitely be back!
the staff at this pet planet is unlike any other! theyre knowledgeable, helpful, and truly care about your fur babies health and well being. the store is clean and always stocked with anything your pets might need!
when one of my dogs was diagnosed with an aggressive form of skin cancer, i did a lot of research to make sure i was feeding them both the best diet possible.  i was already feeding a highquality, grainfree food, but i learned that not all grainfree foods are alike.  i needed to find someone who was knowledgeable about the foods that they carry and could tell me which ones would best suit my dogs needs.  i found that at pet planet tempe!  the staff is extremely helpful and takes the time to listen to what you need.  theyre very familiar with everything that they carry and can recommend the perfect products for your pet.  you just wont find this kind of expertise at the big pet chains.  on top of the great service, the store is well laid out and everything you need is easy to find.  theres even a selfservice dog wash!  they have great specials check out their facebook page and are very supportive in the community.  most importantly to me, theyre huge proponents of animal rescue.  i absolutely recommend this pet planet location to all of my friends and anyone who wants to give their dog the best nutrition possible!
i absolutely love this store and the new owners! ive been going to pet planet for a couple of years now, and they have always helped me find the right food, toys, treats etc. for my dogs. everyone is so knowledgable and honest about the product! its nice to not be sold something that youre unsure of and not to mention nothing is over priced! it makes it easier on me that i know my dog is getting the proper nutrition and im not over paying! i love this store and will always support local businesses, especially when they know their shit!!!
ive been going to pet planet location for some time now, all there is to say is that this store is the best pet store in the valley, from the friendly knowledgeable staff to their selection of product, an animal lover couldnt ask for more. i would highly recommend this pet planet location to anybody who wants to provide their 4 legged family member with the best food, coolest toys, or even if you just needed some advice from their staff on how to care for your pet.  four claws up to pet planet in college park!
love this store!! ever since it opened across the street from my place i have gone in there about 2 times a week. they sell the best pet products in the area without offering products like rawhide and whatnot that are harmful to your pets, they have a huge selection of top grade food for animals and at the best price! my dog loves haley and the rest of the staff because  every time we go in there they treat him like he was one of  their own!. i have referred everyone i know and everyone i talk to at the dog park to check them out, and so far they are all current loyal customers with them. plus they will beat anyones price :
i have been shopping at pet planet at college park in tempe, az for over two years. i have met the owners and the manager haley.  they have all been so helpful to me with my 17 year old lhasa apso, angel, and jasper, my rescue dog who is a yorkie.  he has had valley fever since i brought him home and haley has taught me so much about both of my dogs. i believe it is because of her knowledge and expertise that angel has had much more quality to her later years. she has taught me the importance of feeding them quality, preferably, raw dog food. the owners made a good choice by having haley on their team!!
best pet food store in the valley. they take the time to find out what youre looking for and their knowledge of the products make me very comfortable trying new brands for my furry family members. the staff even take the time to follow up to make sure youre happy with your purchase. i recommend pet planet college park to all my pet owner friends,  and i love supporting local businesses.
super super friendly and knowledgeable! she helped my wife and i pick out grain free treats to hide our dogs medication in. lots of selection, and grain free soft treats, which are pretty hard to find. we will definitely be back!
i love their pet wash station!!! super easy to use and they provide everything you need. no more dog hair mess in my bathroom!
excellent service, with reasonably priced, high quality products for your dog or cat. they had some great deals today, such as 30 off zukes dog treats my dogs love these little bites! and 20 off dog beds. they sell one of the best dog foods out there in my opinion at least :  , the honest kitchen in several varieties with prices comparable to amazon. will definitely stop by here again if i need anything else for the pups.
very knowledgeable and helpful staff really care about dogs and buying the healthiest food you can give your pet. have been going for over a year and i wont go anywhere else.
i was able to attend for the friends  family grand opening event  it was an extremely hectic day, and their test run. the training they put in paid off because everything went smoothly. the line was running quickly, and the wait for food was maybe 5 minutes or so. everything came out hot and fresh. theyre offering a full menu at this location, which is great. the location is a bit small, with not much seating inside. other than that, id definitely recommend mcalisters!i love grabbing the youpick 2 for 7.19 deal. you can get 2 of any 12 sandwich, 12 salad, or 12 spud. id definitely recommend the southwest cobb salad, or the summer berry salad if they have it. for sandwiches, my favorites are the southwest turkey melt or the orange cranberry club.
i had a really great experience at this dealership!  ive gone through a bunch of cars in the last 10 years in vegas, and this dealership was the easiest to work with and the least pushy of them all.  im really happy with my prius, and im also happy with the trade value i was offered.  i found these guys to be honest and straightforward.  highly recommend.
had great experiences at this dealership over the years, bought a few cars from them and the staff was always friendly, helpful, and not as pushy as most dealerships. every single time i had an issue with the cars purchased from them they took care of the issue promptly at a very reasonable cost. its always been a pleasure doing business with them. highly recommended
excellent service and great price! i locked my keys in the car while shopping at the meadows mall. i called several locksmiths and one guy said he would be there in 45 minutes, yeah well i waited over 2 hours to no avail. it felt like 120 degrees so you could imagine my irritation. benny said 30 minutes and he was there in 25! i was in my car within the next 3 minutes. i would definitely recommend to a friend.
a few weeks ago i forgot my keys in the car and locked myself out of my car. i called up a few locksmiths but they said that it would take an hour to get there... i was in front of the unlv. worst part was that i was late for a date, i had to unlock my car fast. luckily i found lees locksmith and he was able to show up quickly and unlocked my car in 10 seconds, for a great price. i would definitely recommend his service. p.s. the date went get ;
great experience. we were locked out of our home. he came very quickly. one lock is very old and i thought it would need to be drilled, but he was patient and was able to to it without drilling. he was quick and we were back in our home in no time. we put him in our favorites for a locksmith.
so, a key broke in my front door lock.  i called many locksmiths to get quotes.   most were over 120, 50 service plus 60 or more for the job.called benny at lees locksmith.   he quoted me 75 without seeing the problem.  he may have under quoted the job.  but he was willing to earn the business.   he showed up with a smile and ready to work.  took him about an hour to fix my lock n replace a few parts.  he wouldnt leave until it was perfect.  i liked his service and will definitely use him again.  the best locksmith in vegas and ive used 2 so far but spoken to many.   thanks benny
this place is excellent! i was on my way to amf desert hills lanes and i stopped in here to get some socks. i found what i was looking for and paid what i needed to pay. this store is nice and clean and it opened a week ago so it is a great store!
brand new location that is very well stocked with some of the latest trendy fashions. as soon as you walk in your immediately greeted by a staff of friendly employees with a smile.this location has late hours which is nice because you can still find great deals later into the night. like typical ross stores they have everything you will find at other location except there is plenty to choose from. some ross stores have very minimal merchandise while this one is completely full. since it is new it is neat, clean and organized which makes it easier to shop.
was greeted at the door, very clean, associates were on task, no clothing or shoes were on the floor, everything was organized, and there is a great selection to shop from. i will be back!
vdn west location is formally freddies nutrition, which was also a great store, located immediately next to starbucks and near las vegas athletic club.vegas discount nutrition brings there great prices and volume of products just like the eastern location along with great staff. one thing you will notice immediately walking in is the overall store set up with several isles of shelves housing many products and the exterior walls stacking products almost to the ceiling. yes it is a little more crowded with this type of set up compared to the older freddies however this allows for more volume and more variety of products. with everything from protein, weight loss, vitamin, bars, endurance gelsgu, peanut butters, to a refrigerator section carrying liquid egg white, drinks, shakes, and ez bread, and many more items you sure to find what you need here. there is not many brands of products that they dont carry. one of the best things ive always liked about vdn is there overall prices. they simply have some of the bestlowest prices or at very least most competitive price point of all products and its always nice to get a free sample at checkout! i would personally drive about 25 miles ea. way to the henderson location to stock up per month but now with this west location i am 5 miles!
theres nothing better than when one of your favorite stores or restaurants opens another location closer to you. vdn just opened up their second store in what used to be freddies nutrition on flamingo, across from the lvac there. i used to have to drive all the way to vdns flagship store on eastern av., but now i get their impossibly low prices and fantastic service closeby. the first thing that hits you when you walk in is the selection and quantity of products they have. then you look at the prices and you think its 1986 again. their staff really knows what theyre talking about if you need help, but they dont try to push any house brands or anything else on you. i also overheard one of them say that theyre opening a third store by the lvac on alliante in september. not my neighborhood, but its nice to see when a great place expands. these are the best nutrition stores i have ever seen, and i have seen a lot over the years in many different cities.
ive never written a yelp review before, but after coming here i decided i should. came here last night after going to the lvac right next to it, from the looks of the sign out front, they seemed to be brand new so i figured i would take a look around and check out their prices. cordell and josh greeted my friend and i at the door very politely and asked us if we needed help finding anything or any recommendations, but we said we were just going to look around. soon after we realized that there is way too big of a selection to really know what was going to fit our needs best, so i approached cordell and he asked what i was trying to achieve and steered me toward a product that fit my needs. he was super nice and knowledgeable. the prices in this store even beats most online stores that i have ordered nutrition supplements from before, so i highly recommend this place, especially with it being so close to the gym. thanks dudes!
while on a business trip to vegas we heard that our favorite nutrition store vegas discount nutrition expanded. the store on the west part of the city is very clean and massive. stocked up and great customer service as always. helpful staff when we needed an advice. great to see a company like that expanding. always amazes me every time we go in there, how great their prices are.  we stocked up on our supplements. they shipped us our order and it was waiting for us when we got back home. highly highly recommend the company and give fivestar all the way !!!!!!!
this second location of vegas discount nutrition is definitely closer to me and a welcome addition to the west side of town.  now i can get the bcaas, whey protein, quest bars, and other supps i regularly buy without driving to henderson.  the same low prices of the original store are also here.  it pains me to see other yelpers check into those bigger chain nutrition shops because i know theyre probably paying way more than they should. just dont do it. the bf and i know this because we usually compare other nutrition stores prices just to be sure that vdn is still the cheapest and it usually is by quite a bit. whatever you do, dont buy supps at your gym; the markup is ludicrous. unless a place is willing to price match, you should come here first and check out vdns prices.although this store is smaller than the eastern location, it still has all the items i need, just in a more compact space.  whether youre on beast mode or just an average joe, stop by here for all of your nutritional supplement needs.  if you dont know what those are or have questions, the staff is very knowledgeable and helpful, especially since many of them look like they could lift small cars, like cordell, who competes in bodybuilding shows on the regular.
i enjoy checking out different nutrition and health food restaurants. i must say vegas discount nutrition is handsdown the best nutrition store ive ever seen. there is not even a close second anywhere in town. selection price  service is all fivestar outstanding.i love how clean neat and organized they keep the store. fivestar service all the way.
i couldnt be more excited about these guys opening a 2nd location! i always shop at the one on eastern when im traveling to vegas because their pricing and service is amazing!!!
i am so happy vegas discount nutrition has a second store now! this makes it so much easier to pick up all of my supplements depending on the part of town im in. i travel a lot for business and i spend a good portion of my month in las vegas alone. i load up my suitcase and take as much as i am able home because they have everything i need at the lowest prices.  the staff is as great as the store. anthony and cordell are absolute sports nutrition gurus and class acts. they are great resources for all of my questions ive had thus far. if you havent stopped in before, be prepared to have the best supplement experience. love this store!
their prices beat the internet and anywhere else in town! the guy who helped me, matt, had tried all the products i asked about. his recommendations for the new products i bought, in addition to my usual shopping list, were perfect. dymatize orange creamsicle protein, and the new i force caffeine free pre workout. as a registered dietitian nutritionist, it was a real surprise and treat to talk with someone who has a actual understanding of exercise nutrition and knows the products! thanks again!
we came in here looking for a new preworkout and josh quickly assisted us and helped us, he knew the ingredients in almost every product he showed us. definitely coming back because of this great customer service!
cordell consistently provides great service, hes incredibly knowledgeable, and vdn has amazing prices!!!! you could never have too much of a great thing. congrats guys on the new location!!
best prices, incredible selection, and amazing customer service is how i would describe vegas discount nutrition. the second location is smaller than the eastern location but they manage to pack in a lot of stuff! i follow them on facebook and when you like and review you are automatically entered to win a free product that they give away everyday. vegas discount has everything i need and more!
this is my new favorite place to buy all my supplements! not only are their prices great, they have awesome customer service. anthony helped me out and was great at answering all the questions i had. i will definitely be back!
my husband and i recently checked out this new vegas discount nutrition. let me tell you, this place is amazing! when we first walked in we couldnt believe the amount of products and we were greeted very politely. i like that the staff is there to answer questions but they definitely dont try to push products on you that youre not interested in. the prices are literally unbelievable, they are way lower than what ive seen online. a store like this deserves 10 stars! totally outstanding in all areas. i highly recommend.
after a client canceling there session with me i had some free time so i was headed to the starbucks for a coffee and i see this huge banner  vegas discount nutrition  announcing the new location. i step inside and its quite impressive never seen a supplement store of that size actually utilize so much space and they are fully stocked with products reminds me of my favorite store costco. much better set up then before and way more impressive then the nutrition rash stores i see all over town.. what kind of pig is running those establishments what a dump. best of luck vegas discount nutrition.
ive actually been coming to this location for years old freddies. its quite a bit better to be honest. great service with knowledgable staff, who actually look like they work out. not like the malls or other stores. prices are amazing and the selection is top notch. only the best brands and almost every variant of flavors as well. i wouldnt hesitate to come here over other stores, or even the internet to be honest. prices are highly comparable. if youre new to the fitness game they will guide you in the right direction. if youre a seasoned vet, youll know they carry what you need and want. great place!
my absolute favorite store for all my health and nutrition needs! i was a big fan of freddies prior but they have gone and made the store even better now. more products and the best prices in town hands down. nobody can compete with them on price. its difficult for me to even find any online pricing that can compare. vdn has everything i need from sunwarrior products to allmax. the staff here is the best in town. all of them are quite knowledgeable about all the products in the store and have answered any and all questions i have thrown at them. the location cant beat if you workout at lvac. for all your nutrition needs go see matt and the gang at vegas discount nutrtion. you will be happy you did.
this place has it all vitamins supplements proteins you name it they have it. great prices great hours great staff great location and staff is awesome! i would definitely check this place out .
great store and selection, pricing and service is outstanding. there is nothing like this anywhere in las vegas. do yourself a favor and check it out!
its good to know that vdn continues to expand. i often go to the s. eastern location and now they just opened another one on the flamingo215 side. this place is also just as stocked with an incredible variety of nutrition supplements and the best prices lower even than bodybuilding.com. but most of all their representatives are smiling, friendly, professional and highly intelligent about their products these guys are nutrition certified and if theyre unable to answer a question no problem, theyll look it up for you . you dont have to worry about them trying to sell you anything. because you will definitely have to hold yourself back from taking home all the great deals they have in the store. as a trainer, i send all my clients there to find and educate themselves on the best, most up to date nutritional supplements without the jacked up prices. vdn, congratulations and best wishes on the grand opening of your second location!
great prices compared to other nutrition shops in vegas! has a nice selection and they give you a lot of samples.
i love coming here! always find the supplements i need at a very reasonable price. way better deals than other nutrition stores. and aside from that...the staff is always so helpful and knowledgeable! i enjoy shopping here.
awesome customer service......very helpful and patient with beginners new to working out
love this place. wonderful addition to the neighbourhood. internetlevel prices in a brickandmortar storefront any day of the week. friendly staff too, love the samples.
used to settle for gnc until i came across this place after a gym session. awesome selection and the best prices ive seen in vegas. the staff is also super friendly and always eager to assist! dont plan on going anywhere but here from now on.
professional nutrition store for any nutrition purpose. go there regularly for pick up my favorite quest bars. nice price for any flavors you desired in one box.
do you want to enter supplement heaven???  stop by any of the vegas discount nutrition locations and youll see what im talking about.....another fabulous vegas discount nutrition location.  walking distance from my gym and next door to starbucks...coffee and protein anyone?;  whether im on the east, west, or north side of town, theyve got my back.  theres no other nutrition store that ill ever have to buy my supplements at.  they have everything i need.  friendly and knowledgeable staff, clean and organized store, by far the most inventory ive ever seen, and unbeatable prices. oh and to place the cherry on top, they provide you with free samples!  its a no brainer....vegas discount nutrition is where its at.thank you for all you do!
these folks rock n roll as in they always have what i need when i need it all at great prices.
micah is amazing! i bought the deal 4 for the price of 3 and ended up continuing with weekly lessons ever since. hes really great at teaching specific skills. such a talented drummer. highly recommended! he was also extremely patient with me as a first time drummer.
micah is the man!!! super talented drummer who not only rips on the drums but is able to break it down in a way that helps you learn. if you want to learn the drums from not only the best drummer in town but the best teacher in town, give him a call!
a lot of people in town know micah as one of the most talented drummers in several bands. as a teacher he is equal to that skill!  patient with new drummers even adults and great with kids. his lessons are great and teach you the skills you need, all you have to do is the homework!  and lets face it, drumming is pretty fun homework!
i am known as the antibeat, not the best drummer in the neighborhood. however, after a couple of lessons with micah i am now holding my own and looking to start my own band! micah is an excellent drummer and an even better teacher who is patient and an absolute blast to jam with.  i highly recommend micah as a teacher and cant wait for my next lesson! ftcf
micah is a flat out rock star! good luck finding a better drummer! or a better teacher for that matter. hes patient and funny, making learning easy as well as a great time. if micah is teaching, you will learn. simple as that. he is in multiple bands that are all excellent. if you have even the slightest doubt regarding his skill go see one of his shows!
micah is a great drummer but more importantly hes patient and understands an individuals skill level. his passion for the instrument is clearly demonstrated in how he plays and works with someone to naturally build up their confidence and skills. worth a lesson just to hang out and watch him hit those things :
great service and great food. the server was very friendly and receptive. it is a great local hangout. if you want to just eat, you can go in the dining room  to avoid the smoke. the bartenders are also very friendly and offer prompt service.
danny is the man! we like to head there after work and he always gives us a great experience. its the best customer service ive had at any bar. the food is good too, but the drink specials are great.
some of the best bar food around, the fish and chips, hot breaded wings and burgers are just awsome. robyn is one of the best bartenders i have encountered, she is very attentive to all patrons.  great job john , robert , and robyn
great locals hangout and open 247. breakfast, lunch and dinner and numerous daily specials to select from.we had breakfast this morning and the service was really good. i had the chicken fried chicken, eggs, toast and sweet potato tots.lana had steak and eggs. everything was prepared promptly and fresh. only slight drawback was the breading on my chicken fried chicken was a little overly salty and lana said her steak lacked seasoning, so one item over salted and one item under seasoned, but still a great place for breakfast. weve dined here many times when it was timbers and it was good and now as village pub its even better. the fish and chips are a standard and the bbq ribs is something well try sometime soon.kind of an out of the way location, but try it out. its never over crowded and the service is very good.the man today in the black chefs coat, jon was a great host! he really cared about your comfort and was always checking on us.check out the specials on the blackboard it has some great values. also happy hour 11pm to 3 am and 3pm to 6pm daily. prices are great, but the happy hour prices makes it even better.our breakfast this morning, chicken fried chicken, steak and eggs, with two coffees was 20 and change! ill give you 20, go to the grocery store and try to recreate this breakfast, it cant be done.village pub, 215 and gibsonamerican pacific in henderson. check them out anytime! 5 stars!
football food and drinks wonderful meatball slidersrobin is a wonderful bartender1 place

such a great time. we brought our friends over from out of state and thought lets do something a bit different. couldnt have asked for anything better then this. so much fun! talk about teamwork... all you need is to look at those clues and use your brain. you will have so much with your friends doing this. i guarantee it!
what a great time! definitely takes teamwork to get thru the rooms. ok ok so we needed a couple hints along the way lol. will be bringing more friends back to do the other rooms.thanks for the great time :
great time with the family!! excellent customer service and instructions. very clean and organized. well definitely be back soon!
went on a team building excursion with a group of colleagues on a recent business trip.  what a great concept and what a great time!!  the staff was wonderful.  the adventure was fun and challenging.  the escape the dead room was a little warm, but other than that was fantastic.  great decorations.   fun and well thought out themes.  and definitely perfect for promoting teamwork.  definitely requires it to get through.  plan to try out the same thing closer to home in chicago with some friends and family.  highly recommend!
loved it! i took my family who were visiting from out of town. they loved it so much that they have been talking about it for days! we all want to go back when they visit again. customer service was great and rooms were very clean. definitely recommend.
had an amazing time! stumped me more than a few times! great to go with family and friends. try not to over think it because we totally did!
with family in from out  of town, this was a great activity for a multigenerational group..  i am looking forward to a return trip
we did our team building activity here, the escape the dead room. it was so much fun!! stumped us and surprised us! we will all recommend this place to everyone we come encounter with! mick was a stellar host as well! we will definitely be coming back!
new to nv i was referred to this shop the customer service there is outstanding. the shop is very clean  orderly, the owners were very patient answering all my questions. i would definitely go back.try them youll love them. i mean just the fact that they came to my location to pick me upthat might not be there normal practice but it was a great jesture when the job was done.over the top customer service. two thumbs up.
this place has great customer service, im satisfie with the work they did in my car its quick and simple. they explain everything they did and there prices are great! i recommend this place !
loved the work,  very honest and trustworthy.  i am big on integrity and they showed me the part that was defective and showed me the location of the problem.  i wouldnt go anywhere else for my car repairs.
i love this hotel. we just arrived and the place is brand new! the lobby and public areas are very nice, rooms are completely new with modern touches and designed for the new age travelers. wifi is fast, electric outlets very well located with usb connections available besides your bed and in the computer table. a 43 led tv, microwave and fridge are also very convenient. the personnel is also lovely. definitely a place to come back in a family trip!
big thank you to nicole for helping me out this morning! i called about a canceled rewards night stay and she was so helpful and sweet! you are very lucky to have her! the ihg customer service line was not helpful at all, but nicole went out of her way to talk me through what was going on with my account.
i really cant express how wonderful this hotel is.  we showed up several hours early and instead of turning us away they hustled to get a room ready for us.  the rooms are really nice and modern.  the hotel is right across the street from pnc park and seems to be a pretty safe area.  the hotel staff was extremely professional and kind.  this hotel is also doing great work for the community and for that they should be highly commended.
i stopped in last night, and i have to say that this is a great shop. everyone there is super friendly, helpful and knowledgable. theyve got a great selection of juices, an awesome builder in house and just an overall good vibe and atmosphere. if you vape, you need to check them out. two thumbs up!
phenomenal staff, excellent selection and just a fun place to be! recommended to all vapers!
awesome shop, reasonable prices, friendly people. visited there and for being a new shop theyre already sweeeeeet! their logo is ohmazing too
lets just say this vape shop is freaking awesome first time there in get greeted by everyone working there! perfect environment really laid back.they have tons of selections for juice. preston worked with me trying to find my favorite flavor which is hard to find. the shop is kept clean and really roomy you can just relax and watch tv. so if your a vaper that loves to relax and meet new people defiantly come here its worth it!!!!
let my start off by saying the ohm factory is amazing the guys down there are respective funny an just welcoming you can hang out down there for hours an they wont mind there builds an juice selection is amazing they have a nice set of different mods a few different tanks an attys they have a big tv and a comfy couch to sit sit an just watch whatever its not hot there very good room temperature the ventilation is alright doesnt get to cloudy the guy who runs the place alex great guy very up beat everytime i see him its conveniently located next to a pizza joint and a dairy queen which is good if you get hungry i recommend this shop definitely
for starters, i dont yelp too much anymore since i started blogging but i really wanted to give this shop an immediate shout out before i write my full length review. i accidentally stumbled upon a diamond in a ruff this evening and im pleasantly surprised. i normally dislike going to vape lounges because i find woman arent as welcomed and in general treated like theyre ignorant beings in the world of vaping. not this shop, the owner is very welcoming, full of life and funny without trying to hard. he shows a passion for vaping and takes pride in his shop. he also shows a great appreciation for his customers and is humble when given compliments. he also has a very welcoming store manager who was kind enough to let me try some of his personal stash of juices and didnt seem offended for my lack of interest in them. another enjoyable part of this establishment was the owners little secret weapon, i believe his name was david but for all intensive purposes will call him the juice master. he let me try juices that havent hit selves yet, that he personally created and let me say oh my god theyre amazing. im always on the hunt for unique and flavorful juices. this guy is the best in his craft, and i cannot wait to try more from him. he made a raspberry bourbon juice that was to die for, it made me super sad i couldnt buy a bottle right then, but the second it hits the shelves i will be there. the rest of his juices were quite remarkable as well but i will leave the curious minds to take my word for it and go in to try them once they hit shelves. honestly this is overall one of the best vape lounges ive been to in over six different states and one of the most welcoming. cant wait to go back and hang!
alright the reviews are on point. this place is great. i was told by someone else to check it out and glad i did. they are very welcoming and it is a very laid back atmosphere.erik worked with me, he is awesome, i got my billows tank from them and he made my coils for it and wicked it. alex the owner is from ny so its always nice to meet a fellow nyer. glad i came here and it is nice to have a spot that i can go to that is actually not far from home. they have a good house juice line along with many others for house juice i am a fan of the blueberry waffles one and the raspberry one. if you get a chance to check them oout do it!
so, im visiting from california. i call a couple different vape shops looking for someone who sells tfv4 could. after speaking to 34 unfriendly people on the phone, i call the ohm factory. i spoke to a super friendly and helpful man on the phone named eric, who said yes they sold the coil and because we were first time customers wed get 10 off of our purchase in total, and hed see me soon. we rushed over. every time i come to phoenix, i will be at this shop. every single person i spoke to who worked here was ridiculously kind, helpful and efficient. they were extremely informative of their builds and juices, and were even kind enough to give us free tickets to a vapor convention going on nearby that their builders were at! the owner was amazing. chatted to us about all kinds of things the entire time we were there, and eric did a spectacular build for me on my kennedy. the vape shop alone was beautiful. the interior is rustic feeling, with a very warm and comfortable vibe inside that i know i could just sit at and chill all day. thanks guys for giving me my goto shop for when i visit arizona!
hands down best vape shop ive found so farmy boyfriend and i live in vegas and drove down for the day to check out a car listing off craigslist.  vegas doesnt have the greatest juice selection and we were vaping on some crappy juice so decided to search yelp for a good vape shop before we made the trip home and im happy to say we found this place.all of the other reviews are spot on... the owner is the nicest guy, him and his employees treat you like family! xavier and the owner sat down with us to talk about everything.  they checked out our mods, gave us some pointers as to things we may have been doing wrong with our temp control, wattage, and other settings... walked us through all different juices and let us try just about everything until we found the juice we liked theyre really knowledgable on all different juice brands, if you want an expert opinion trust theirs.  the owner even let us take hits off of his own mod.  hes super friendly and welcoming... when we left to hit the road xavier offered their bathroom to us to wash out our tanks and get all set up for the trip back.theyre all about making their customers happy, good quality juices, the best products, running a great business ... if you come to this shop they wont treat you like just another dollar to their sale and it shows with their customer service.unfortunately there arent shops like this out in vegas, but glad to know that this shop exists and that they are creating a website soon.  we will definitely be giving our business to this shop!
there needs to be 5 stars and a lil  for exceptional places like this. i am a total newbie to the vape stuff myself, but have been to most all the vape shopslounges in az. i was treated and talked to like a regular customer and not with attitude. this tends to happen to me bc for my very first vape set up i kinda went overboard bc i was given a smok tfv4 tank and from there i ended up with the smok cube ii just bc i prefered to match. the employee and owner let my friend and i try juice after juice and even let us use his mod to sample juices. i was treated like i was in my home with family and im being serious. i will only take my money nomatter what city im in to ohm. just top notch!! the best bar too!!!
best vape shop in the valley by an order of magnitude. the atmosphere is relaxed and the staff are extremely knowledgeable, unbiased, patient, and friendly. wish i could give more than just 5 stars.edit and disclosure: since writing this review, i have become close friends with the staff and owners at the ohm factory. im leaving and still stand by my above, unaltered review which i wrote after my very first visit to the ohm factory, before befriending them.
so once upon a time, while looking for a convenient vape shop in gilbert, i stumbled upon the ohm factory. it was such an amazingly friendly environment and i fell in love with this shop. come to the ohm factory! you wont be disappointed! :
did a spring break road trip with our 2012 dodge journey from vancouver to phoenix,  25 hours in total.   weather was decent but when we turned on the ac for the first time,  it blew only hot air from passenger side.  8 hours of that!  so when i searched yelp for a trustworthy dodge service dealer,  i was dismayed to read the crappy reviews here.   took a chance and im glad i did.   nick franzen did an exemplary job checking my warranty from canada,  doing a multi check and even a car wash! cost to me?   nothing,  nada,  zilch.   all covered under warranty.   phew! they were efficient,  communicative and friendly.   cant do any better.
so inviting and friendly!  what a great place for an expecting mom.   gender revels is just the start.  had my massage with loren can you say so fantastic.  the owner kylah is so pleasant to work with.   i cant wait to go back.
great place!  have had several massages here and i am not even pregnant.  love it!!!!
i stumbled upon mommy 2b experience while searching for a location to perform a 4d ultrasound that i could invite my husbands family to witness.  i spent several days reading reviews for other locations around the valley when oddly i received an email from groupon listing 4d ultrasound deals.  i typically do not purchase from groupon for services because it seems to be a bare minimum, someones going to try and upsell you situation but i took my chances this time.  prior to purchasing i did call the location to ask for the difference in the packages on groupon and those they offer online, i was explained very simply that groupon is just cheaper : i purchased the groupon online and was able to book the appointment through yelp...very simple.  we arrived at the location with myself and 7 other people.  the store is adorable, clean and very welcoming.  the lady at the front desk greeted us all, gave us some paperwork to fill out and told us it would be a short wait before we began.  once in the ultrasound room, i was even more impressed.  first the bed for me to lay on was much more comfortable than anything ive ever experienced at my drs office, there are 2 large sofas for family to sit, a chair next to the ultrasound bed for my husband and the imagery of the ultrasound displayed larger than life on the wall in front of us all.  the technician that performed the ultrasound was very sweet and patient.  she explained everything that she was showing to the family.  per the groupon deal, our appointment was supposed to be only 20min however baby was not cooperating and did not wish to be photographed at that time.  the technician spent an extended amount of time with us and even called in her boss to get a better photo.  i was not expecting them to extend the amount of time in order to give us a good photo, especially with how cheap the deal was purchased from groupon.  we left with the entire ultrasound on dvd and some really great printed out photos.  i would love to find the time to come back to this establishment to try out the other services they offer for massage and spa treatments.
we couldnt decide if we wanted to know our babys sex but we definitely wanted a 3d4d ultrasound. after visiting mommy 2 be experience, we knew we had to have a reveal party it was a great way to surprise our family and for everyone to be introduced to baby george! the manager, kyla, was very helpful and a pleasure to work with. i cant wait to come back for massages and shopping. their boutique is adorable. im so glad i found mommy 2 b.
this was my first 3d 4d ultrasound experience and i really appreciated this company. i showed up an hour early for my appointment late in in the evening which was one of their last ones of the day. they were able to get me in right away because they didnt have any other patients and they were so patient and kind. the place has a very pleasing set up and decorations. the room for the ultrasound is large and very comfortable i wish the doctors office was like that!  the baby wasnt positioning to reveal gender, but she kept trying and eventually got it! i was so glad she didnt give up. i use their groupon deal, but i would happily pay full price to go back. my husband found out the gender that night so he bought some really cute onesies from them and i cant wait to see! if i didnt live in henderson i would totally take advantage of their exercise and education classes!
grand opening today great margaritas! the bartenders are crazy good. give this place a chance you will enjoy your time. excellent food great fun happy hour or for dinner or a quick lunch. remember to ask for house at the bar!
the staff is great. friendly and welcoming. service was smooth during this grand opening day too.  we sat at the bar you have to order at the window if you want to sit at a table. the nachos with carnitas pork were way delicious. definitely happy about this location and hope they thrive
so far so good! mario was an amazing bartender! margaritas were on point! we were greated right away by who we think might be the owners they explained how everything works and mario did the same for us as well. we only got the margaritas today along with the warm chips and salsa bar. very friendly staff, good atmosphere... we will definitely be back and mario has a lot to do with it!
ive been wanting to eat at a hussongs forever and was never able to make it down to their locations in mexico.   growing up in la, i know good mexican food and was really looking forward to trying them out; i was not disappointed!  you enter the door and go straight to the counter to place your order.  their prices are economical and comparable to chipotle or qdoba, but ohsomuch better!  my fiance had the carnitas tacos with rice and beans 9.95 plus the bottomless chips and salsa for 1.95 freshly made chips and a salsa bar for the grazing...good stuff!.  i had the chicken bowl, which included chicken, cilantrolime rice, cheese, pineapple it also comes with guac and onions, but i got it without.  it was delicious and a heaping portion!  i couldnt have been happier!  speaking of happy, we were there during happy hour and though there are no food specials, the drinks are half off and with that, i had one of the best margaritas ive ever had!  the beer selection is good and the well tequila was really, really good.  we were there on their grand opening night and totally by accident and the service was on point!  every staff member we had contact with was friendly and happy; the manager and several other servers in the bar area kept checking back with us to make sure we had everything we needed and if everything was perfect.  very attentive and genuinely concerned about our experience.  a great experience and we will come back again and again!!!
hussongs cantina has just opened their new location in boca park and they prove again theyre masters at the best mexican food and drink!   after years of steering clear of margaritas due to the sweet and syrupy taste, i reclaimed being a fan....but only of the original margarita at hussongs!  i actually cant wait to have another one!   as far as the food, since i am a bit of a health nut, i am very particular about restaurant food and was thrilled to see great options in veggie entrees, gluten free items and the best part is that it is all freshly made!  i will be going there again very soon!!
great hopitality at this upcoming establishment in the boca parksummerlin  area. elizabeth and house the bartenders on duty, wow they make excellent margaritas. the feel of this bar is genuine and makes you feel at home. shout out to brian mangino the director of operations he really knows what excellent customer service is. brian and his team made our visit very enjoyable the minute we sat down at the bar. give this establishment a try you wont regret it!!!!
great margaritas!  love the street corn!  and they even have a good chardonnay.  the atmosphere is delightful and people friendly.  happy hour 3 to 7!  this is a great addition to the summerlin food scene.
ate here with a some girlfriends thursday night. staff was very friendly and made recommendations when asked. the food was excellent, especially the corn on the cob. drinks were good, but perhaps a bit expensive. they do have a happy hour though and margaritas are half price. the waiters were very attentive. definitely looking forward to returning!
the new destination in summerlin, hussongs kicks a.  two things  great service and great food!  scott and jeff have extended their groundbreaking venue at mandalay place with a patio and a great vibe!  staff is friendly and setup is top notch, you wont be disappointed.
what a great local find! great happy hour and the margaritas are awesome. loved my tacos and guacamole too.
food is so good! manager chris was super cool and nice to my boyfriend and i! he came up and checked up on us and our meal occasionally. food is amazing!!!! cant even put a better word on it too do justice . gotta check it out.
my experience has been delightful. my friends and i came in for a bite and drink while mnf and we enjoyed the food.. i had the kung pow shrimp tacos... yuuuummmmm!!! also had the el pepino margarita, it was perfection every sip of the way. my friend had the deep fried avocado tacos... pretty good too. i will be coming back to watch the super bowl :
chris is the man very helpful and nice!!! the hole entire staff was very professional and made a great environment to have dinner and drinks!
very delicious, flavorful, and tasty food! you can sit inside or enjoy the outside. there are several large tv screens for your viewing pleasure so you wont miss the game. theres a full bar... and a salsa bar! the food and decor make it appealing to want to sit for a while and hang out with your friends, be served, and have a few drinks. thats one option. you also have the option to walk to the back, wait in a line, read the big menu on the wall, place your order, pay, then find your own seat somewhere like at wahoos or panera and they will bring the food to you. this is a great concept for people on their lunch breaks because it eliminates the middle man of waiting to order, pay the bill, etc.
came here for the monday night football game. happy hour is great and you have to try the pork belly tacos. if you want the house made guacamole i would highly advise getting it for an appetizer.
as they say you can never get a second chance on a first impression. with that said i have to say what a great 1st impression! was greeted in a welcoming manner and was told about the happy hour specials. these specials are incredible! drafts 2.95 and some excellent food specials to.  just for checking in to yelp i received a complimentary order of their street corn right on the cobb with the husk still attached. i really enjoyed the atmosphere as well. just a great place for great food, family and friends to hang out.
the bartenders justin and elizabeth are amazing! they treat me like family every time i go there. excellent place to chill out and watch the games inside or outside. great food. the barbocoa over a bed of rice is amazing. they stay true to their ensenada roots with the decor. best local hangout spot
for lunch, my wife suggested a new place shed seen. a cantina in boca park?  gotta be pretentious, im thinking. quite the contrary. the atmosphere is very casual and the staff very friendly and courteous. i would liken it to chipotle meets sports bar but with higher end ingredients. the restaurant and restrooms were very clean and the service was excellent. our party of six was seated immediately and drink orders taken on the spot. the bartender brought me the wrong beer and before it even registered in my mind, she returned with the correct beer and told me to keep the first. all right, this is my kinda place. the menu is a bit limited, but hey, its tacos. the street corn is charred to perfection and the salsa bar is pretty good, too.  the manager checked on us, which i always like, and we were in and out in just over half an hour. price was very fair, too. cant wait to go back.
just got back from eating the best burrito. definitely ask for amanda she the best . the friendliest waitress ive ever met in vegas.  5 stars
excellent margaritas! chicken nachos are amazing, gotta try the rib eye tacos!! fire!! the bartender amanda is fun and friendly!!! not to mention she has the cutest southern accent! lol. highly recommended place to spend with friends and have drinks!!!
ordered a rice bowl with steak. not bad. salsa bar is outstanding. margaritas were above average. however our server amanda was the highlight of our lunch !! will come back just for her !!!
awesome place.  chris is great! suggests drinks and food items if you were never here. the music is great, atmosphere is comfortable and friendly. the food is amazing, the steak quesadillas are delicious and crunchy as well as cheesy and yummy. the original margarita is perfect. i will definitely come back.
great food chris is awesome very personable delicious margaritas i love the music and the atmosphere i hate going on this to try to upload a review because my phone sucks the wifi would not connect to my phone
i absolutely love this place! chris, elizabeth and house have all given us great service every time! such personable people! love the food and the atmosphere! theres only one thing i wish was different, and that is the happy hour time! i would definitely come by more than i do if it was maybe 8pmclose! i mean 1 hour just isnt enough!! lets change that guys! make this place even better than it is! :
greatest margaritas in town! they make them from scratch instead of sweet and sour mix. plus the food is amazingly delicious and fresh. i do his recomend anyone looking for a great medical joint to check this place out!
just went here for my first happy hour in vegas since my 21st birthday, good prices for beer and wine, and the tacos and street corn were very good. our waitress amanda was very nice and helpful!
everything was freshgreat customer service from amandagreat atmospherebest tasting margaritagreat tacos
came here with my parents and my twin brothers 1 year old. good service and very very good food. best fish tacos ive had in vegas. i enjoyed the low prices and the quality of the food, for such good prices. not too busy, not enough advertising. but hopefully stays in boca park!
i love the changes that are going on in this complex! the ladies in the front office are always helpful and ready to answer questions.  i have been here almost 2 years and just signed up for another year of course no one likes when rent increases but that is anywhere you go and its actually pretty reasonable for the area. i feel any negative review i have read are people venting the negatives this place is great dont let that stop you from checking this great place out!
today was there grand opening. been there twice already : so far ive tried there chicken and steak plate and there ribs plate. i was impressed with both of them. definitely a healthier alternative compared to many other restaurants. service have been great both times, they care very much for customer experience. ill be back for more ribs on my next trip, maybe ill try the shrimp as well. keep up the good work!!!
the food was great. high quality protein source. great service and great owner. highly recommend.
great food and great staff. the chicken and steak plate is great and the meat is seasoned well. i will definitely be returning.
i have alot of friends in california that love this place and are always posting their food pics from here on ig as post workout meal. finally saw a waba grill here in az and just had to see what it was all about, and i have to say i was very happy. low calorie, high protein meals that do not lack in the flavor department! price isnt bad either! if they would only put one up in north phoenix, glendale area id be a happier girl but there really is no reason i cannot drive 20 min for a healthy, tasty meal!
we loved this place. excellent customer service from the beginning. we were greeted and walked through the menu and ordering for our first visit. they even gave us samples of the steak and chicken. the food was delicious! the steak meat was so tender and fresh. the plate came with rice and salad and it was a very filling meal for 8!
friend and i decided to give this place a shot.  it was a pleasant surprise.  staff was friendly and the prices compare well to the other establishments around it.  i went with a 12 and 12 bowl which was way bigger than i thought.  both the steak and chicken were great.  my friend went with a chicken plate and it looked delicious.  veggies came with both and they were tasty.
ate lunch here today and it was outstanding. had the chicken and steak combo plate and got the veggies instead of the fruit. loved it and my wife liked her chicken plate.i disagree with the previous poster that said you wont get full. i was stuffed when i left and my wife couldnt eat all hers. i got the plate, the bowls looked smaller.
if youre looking for fast healthy food this is the spot for you.  quick service delicious options. will come again.
really awesome food and good customer service! the chicken veggie bowl is my favorite. they also give military discount.
so happy this restaurant is out here from california... healthy option way better than anything else out here
after going through every food place in my head, i couldnt decide for the life of me what to eat. when i saw the sign for waba i decided to try it. walking in, everyone was very friendly. the woman at the cash register answered all my questions with a smile.the food was delicious! i had the chicken vegetable bowl. the veggies were crisp not overcooked, the brown rice wasnt dry, and the chicken had just the right amount of teriyaki sauce. i opted to pay the 1.50 to get avocado on top and it was definitely worth it! they give you a half of an avocado sliced on top.overall the food was great, the staff was friendly, food came out quick, and it was worth the price because i got 2 meals out of it.
happened to be on the westside of the valley and got off the 101 and mcdowell to get some lunch only to find this place: what a great find! tried the halfhalf bowl with no rice extra veggies and fell in love with the taste of the steak.  now whenever i get a chance to get on this side of town i stop by for the steak bowl no rice or added sauce and extra veggies.  have to pay .35 extra for all veggies but simply love the crunchy veggies and can do without rice.  they offer chicken, salmon, and shrimp options as well.  so wish there was a waba grill on the east side of the valley! good thing i have family out here and get chances to stop by every once in a while.
this location has the best customer service ever!!! i enjoy grabbing my coffee on my way to work everyday.. very sweet team!
staff was great!  grand opening specials yeah!   no crowd because we are late but this will be a busy location.  trying that acai bowl.....giving the.  five for the tropical colada
until the past few months, i would never have given a jamba juice more than 4 stars. however, the tropical colada is a 5 star drink. its perfect and the coconut water is an amazing compliment to the fruit in jamba smoothies and im completely obsessed with it.also this staff was super efficient! considering that this was the first day, i wasnt expecting it to be that way but we barely had to wait and were very impressed. please jamba, keep the coconut water!
my favorite jamba juice. staff is friendly and helpful. lobby and juice area is always clean. staff has been trained well and you can tell there is a true leadership at this location.
its funny the wide variety of experiences that are reported when a restaurant first opens. two different diners can simultaneously have delightful and disappointing experiences on the same night. we thought the food at freiburg was fantastic. i had the brat stickers, and jaeger schnitzel,  and my wife had the meatball appetizer and the chicken. our kid devoured his chicken fingers. great selection of german taps and wines. they brought samples of kolsch by our table in tall .2 liter glasses just like they do the in beer gardens we visited in cologne.really true to the concept,  give freiburg a shot. its not heritage or le toille, but it really brings german to this city with so many german connections.
i rarely submit reviews, but given the experience of one of the diners below i felt compelled to. this restaurant was one of the most authentic, comfortable, and truly delicious german based restaurants i have been to. having lived in germany, i often try to find food that replicates my experience there. this restaurant came closer than anywhere i have tried in the u.s. we went for lunch, so i ordered currywurst with the bratkartoffeln, my partner ordered the rheinwurst. the imported mustard from dusseldorf provided at tables was the perfect addition to an already delicious meal. the bratkartoffeln were served just as they are in many parts of germany. we tried some of the beers on tap that are not available in other madison restaurants as far as ive found, and they were great german beers, served perfectly. as evidence of not only the service but degree of authenticity they clearly seek, our waiting staff provided a complementary beer after the original that i ordered was served in the incorrect glass ayinger instead of aventinus  i would not have noticed but the fact that they went out of their way to remedy this was a perfect example of good customer service. a note on pricing  the lunch menu was incredibly reasonable, and the beers very affordable imported beers for around 56. the dinner menu looked a tad more expensive, but nothing unusual for monroe street. the atmosphere facilitated an amazing dining experience. open area with an open kitchen, as german beer halls strive for. the staff was still learning as they recently opened, but nonetheless we felt welcome and valued. we left with smiles on our faces.
i am so glad this place is here, i will come back and bring others!  the food is wonderful, great cooks. and that beer selection, right?! the staff are well timed and knowledgeable about the menu, and full of helpful advice about reheating leftovers.  couldnt ask for a better experience, truly.  the spicy mustard on the table is deliciously spicy careful with this one, remember to breathe through your nose! the jagger schnitzel with the mushroom sauce was dank!!! this is a great addition to the already adorable  monroe street area!
first time in this restaurant and i am greatly impressed. great one for trying some german food .
had a great meal here tonight.  the atmosphere is great, and has a nice cozy feel. the service was very friendly and attentive, and the place was hopping busy.  they have lots of german beers on tab, and a full bar.  the menu seemed well thought out with lots delicious looking options well have to return to try other dishes!. wife had several sides cucumber dill, german fried potatoes, and kohlrabi salad.  i shared my wiener schnitzel entre, that came with german mashed potatoes and red cabbage salad.  it was all so good!  also had a rottler to drink, just like in germany!great place, well definitely return!
tried this place for the first time tonight and loved it! the complimentary pretzelbread with mustard was yummy but the best is the horseradish mustard. i ate a ton of it and want to go to the mustard museum to get some. i ordered cucumber salad, kohlrabi salad, potatoes. all delicious. the pork schnitzel was good too! ill be back!
the kasespaetzel is well worth the visit! this is basically a german mac and cheese that reminds me of a great comfort food. the service was great, the hostess, ali, was very knowledgable and helpful in identifying a vegetarian menu, and the atmosphere was a lot of fun. this is a great new spot in madison, and i would highly recommend stopping by. oh, and the complimentary soft pretzels and dusseldorf mustard are the icing on the cake!
a fabulous restaurant. a modern take on german cuisine, with a large selection of german beers. a place where you can bring your kids or your coworkers  i have been to many german restaurants in the us, and this one stands out. highly recommended!

we were at freiburg gastropub on 9272015 and everything was fabulous. i can say without any doubt that the wurst was the best i have had since 1982 when i was in germany for reforger 82. we had a celebration at the end of the exercise and all of the food and refreshments were fantastic but my wurst sandwich on sunday brought back the memories. i will be back in this case both places!
love this new german spot. best reuben in madison. better than jakes on north ave in mke so freiburg is the best in the state imho. great salads, dont miss the german fried potatoes. nice decor, fairly quiet. grown up, pro waitstaffa great new spot on the westside.
