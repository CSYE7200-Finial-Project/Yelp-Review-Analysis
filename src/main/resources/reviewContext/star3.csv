3.5 stars nice restaurant, good food and average service. got the meatballs and polenta that was tender and tasty but lukewarm in temperature i thought they were made to order or at least heated to safe food temperature. italian meatball soup was good with plenty of mini meatballs and some vegetables. saw the fire oven and ordered a spinach chicken pizza. crust was thick and mildly chewy and had a spinach dip like sauce on top with some chicken, cheese and bacon great combo of flavors. server didnt check on us promptly after the food was delivered, but was good on refilling drinks. food runners deliver your food, so you always have to raise your hand to claim the dish you ordered it would be nice to not have to do that at a restaurant that is priced more than olive garden.
shrimp app was good, service was ok, place was cold, lobster bisque was bad, and the romano salad was ok. might try again but not for awhile
3.5 stars...i really was not wowed by this place, i found it a bit better than the average 3 stars.the four star attributes about this place were the chilled salad on chilled plates, the warm herbed bread and sun dried tomato dipping oil. the latte was creamy and the tiramisu was rich. our server was attentive and friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming.what brought my score down was the ravioli. i didnt wow me. the edges were a bit stiff and the cheese filling was ok. the presentation though was very nice.so i may try something tomato based next time i come in, since im always looking for meal alternatives while shopping.
not too bad of a dining experience.  the service was good and helpful, and the place nicely decorated with a peaceful ambiance.  mostly because of that, i couldnt bring myself to give them 2 stars.  however, the food was only ok.  the chop salad had way too much red onions.  and the chicken marsala need more spices for flavor.  it was a nice surprise that by just checking in on yelp, the restaurant offered you a free appetizer.   however, only valid in the bar and lounge area only.  so with our party of 16 in the dining area, the offer was not valid.  too bad, wouldve given an extra star for the nice gesture.   most likely would not dine here again.  other italian places in town way better in town square or at fashion show mall.
the scallop salad was yummy. scallops were cooked perfectly. we chose to sit outside because the music and noise level inside was very loud for a wednesday night. it was great outside until they brought out a dj then the music outside was so loud we were unable to carry on a conversation. i would not recommend if you want to talk to those you are sitting next to.
i saw pictures of a mythical dessert called nutella cookie sandwich. for a week, ive been imagining what it could possibly taste like and feel like until ive finally decided to try it.by the entrance is a glass display with sports trophies, pom poms, michael jordan lunchbox, algebra book, calculus book and all things that would remind you of school minus the nun that smacks your hand with a ruler because this is public school 702. you just get budget cuts.the menu would remind you of a notebook and the napkins would remind you of a notepad. blackboards on the wall and the moon and planets above your head. hipsters with their glasses, beards, sleeve tats and a beer. 90s hip hop playing in the background.we tried the grilled salmon, bison burger, chicken and waffles and the nutella cookie sandwich. the entrees were just ok. the bison burger had a nice spicy kick to it but i also almost had an anaphylactic reaction because of an ingredient that wasnt on the menu description but was somehow in burger. the fries were not great.the nutella cookie sandwich would be the only reason id come back here. so, you get chocolate chip cookies with nutella schmeared on the flat side of the cookies, vanilla ice cream in the middle with a wall of bacon brittle. i got 5 on it...yup, its only 5 thats big enough for 23 people.the service could use remedial lessons.
ive been to 702 public school about a half dozen times now and i must say the food and beer are amazing and we love the vibe and decor.  so, you ask, why three stars? i feel that the beer glasses are small! maybe ive become accustomed to pints, but these pours seem to be short of its already small glass. mind you, im not ordering high abv beers, which i would expect fewer ounces.  the other star deduction is due to who i think is a manager? he is really handsome and covered in tattoos, but he is loud and obnoxious! the only time i saw him move from his perch at the end of bar was to make a drink and he licked his fingers while doing it. so gross.  we prefer to sit at the bar and found ourselves moving further away from him each time, but you still hear him barking at his staff over the loud music.  his constant need of attention is seriously  unprofessional.
the first time we attempted to try this place, we had to wait for 45 minutes. so, we decided not to and just come back next time. we finally made it on a sunday brunch. overall, it was ok. service is a little slow and i dont know why the servers keep bringing food and asking if its your order. no organization what food to which table? bringing food we didnt order. server passed by to our table and brought our order to the table next to us then came back to us. ill review the food we ordered. sorry no pictures :.1 calamari: 4 stars. good and not greasy2 ahi tuna crunchy tacos: 5 stars. our favorite, nice combinations of flavors and the crunch3 orange juice: 5 stars. so refreshing and mellow tartness of the citrus. 5 fish and chips: 1 star for fish. im always on search of good fish and chips. and i thought ill find the good one here but nope. i dont like too much breadings on fish since they get to oily. we felt like we were eating oil instead of fish. 5 stars on the chips. crunchy, not oily and perfectly seasoned. 6 kids mac n cheese: 5 stars. kid and parents approved. 7 nutella cookie ice cream sandwich: 3 stars. chewy cookies with a nice crunch outside. it has some bacon bits to add a little salty contrast on all the sweetness. its good but nothing to dream about. this place got a nice ambiance. the menus, napkins and decors are very cool. coming back?  maybe.
allow me to give a full explanation into why i would give public school 702 a 3 star rating rather than the 5 id have given if rating on the culver city location.my girlfriend came in from out of town as i just relocated from long beach to las vegas. it was my birthday and lunch was on the agenda. pc offers almost bottomless mimosas at 10 for a carafe which is approximately 4 glasses per carafe. instead of orange juice, myself and another friend ordered them with pineapple juice. the waitress took the order and returned with one glass of mimosa for my friend and nothing for the rest of us. we then realized she never took anyone elses order. first faux pas. we finally put in our drink orders; my pineapple almost bottomless mimosa should be in a carafe but is instead served with only a glass my girlfriend receives hers in a glass as well minus the carafe but with garnish. my glass, nada. the garnish was the rind of the pineapple. not a slice of the pineapple....just the rind, a sprite and a bloody mary garnished with fried chicken. but before the drinks arrive.....we ordered our food.   1. lemon meringue pie2. tatters burned and sent back to the kitchen, buffalo cauliflower, deviled eggs garnished w bacon3. chorizo mac n cheese4. ahi tuna tacos5. burrito unknown but over cooked. sent back to the kitchenso, our food  drinks arrived within moments of one another. sounds legit except we had been waiting awhile for our drinks before even putting in our order for food. as stated above, we asked for pineapple but twice orange juice was brought to the table. food was way over cooked. our server blamed the kitchen for the burned food and the bar for our delayed drinks. while i realize how challenging food service can be, its part of your responsibility to check orders before bringing them to the table. at the opposite end of the table, we watched a gentleman return his burger four times. however, they did bragged about the nutella dessert. behind them, a food critic seemed to cringe at every entree, app and salad ordered; while on the other side of us we saw another couple complain and send back their drinks. i did call on the manager because i do enjoy dining at public school and would love to return with a positive experience. on that, he was very apologetic and ended up compensating our entire meal, drinks included. im not saying you should go into every restaurant to find fault only to get your meals compd however an establishment such as public school can only get better with constructive feedback. had this been my first ever visit, id have had a whole other perspective of disappointment, but i have enjoyed their fare prior and it is quite tasty. that lemon meringue was off the hizzy! it was our first entree of the day. i also enjoyed the buffalo cauliflowerl. my chorizo mac n cheese was super interesting topped with sea salted potato chips and the chorizo was actual spicy sausage. id for sure recommend it.thank you, nick, for handling the issue as professionally as you did. i will return, as you requested, in about a month with my girlfriend to give it another try. lets shoot for a five star
super excited for a new gastropub near me! vegas needs to get down with gastropubs and open up more. first off, the structure itself is really awesome. from the patio, the decor to the vibes. they have an excellent craft brew selection and the food was excellent. no complaints on that!the only thing was service. i really struggled giving this place 4 stars but i had to go with 3 because our waiter was horrible. he was super nice, but he literally never checked on us and kept forgetting our drinks. we kept having to ask other waiters to get them for us. i dont think it was his area, but still, he wasnt busy. we went on a sunday night at 8 and didnt leave until 10 because it took forever to get anything. thats a huge downer.for the beer: i had dawn of the red. it was amazing. its a hoppier amber with fruit notes. its now one of my favorites. food: fiery calamari  very good and fried perfectly. it wasnt spicy at all though.shrimp and grits   it was super tasty. the grits are more of a grits cake and it has so much in it with a ton of flavor. the sauce was very rich and spicy. beef short rib with parmesan mashed potatoes  it was very good and the au jus gravy was very rich. the nutella cookie sandwich. im going to be 100 honest. im not a dessert person. but when i saw this cookie on yelp, i decided to go here solely for that purpose. and friends, it did not disappoint. it was the best cookie and ice cream dessert ive ever had in my life. the cookie was all gooey and soft. so perfect. overall  i loved this place. i saw other servers being super tentative to their tables. we just got super unlucky. i would love to go again soon to try out other dishes and other yummy beers.
we arrived on a tuesday night, around 8 pm. it was surprisingly busy. we requested to sit on the patio and the hostess said it would be just a minute while they set our table up. im almost positive she forgot about us. we stood there for over ten minutes. another hostess asked if we were waiting for someone, when we replied that we were waiting for the table, she looked around a little confused. when we were finally sat at the table that had been ready for almost ten minutes, we were handed menus. we looked them over and got excited about all the delicious options to eat and drink. lots of craft beers on their menu see photo. we asked for water while we looked over the menus. another server came over and took our drink order. my boyfriend got the lavender vanilla and i ordered a cabernet. we received our drinks, but still no water. my wine was fantastic and my boyfriends drink was perfect for sipping im not really into whiskey, but it was good. we ordered the quinoa poblano prepared vegan with no cheese, broccolini prepared vegan with sauteed garlic, kale slaw with brussels prepared vegan, and the brown bag potato fries not vegan but for my boyfriend;. our server came to the table with water finally and some bad news. the poblano couldnt be prepped vegan: its prepped with cheese, and so is the kale shaved brussels:. back to the menu... i opted for the veggie chili thats created with a mushroom thickening base vegan. granted it was 100 degrees outside i wasnt super excited but it worked. my boyfriend ordered the chorizo mac and cheese, since we couldnt share the poblano. our food eventually arrived, but my chili had some cream on top... had to send it back and wait again. the broccolini was amazing. perfectly seasoned and sauteed to a crisp crunch. we finished it in no time. we were being attacked by bugs by the time my food made it to the table. bug lights would be ideal for their patio. the chili was awesome. it came with a kale waffle i couldnt eat but it was filling by itself. overall... it was a good meal. a little disorganized and patience was definitely a virtue we were practicing that evening. would i return? yes, happy hours on the patio with my laptop, school books, and boyfriend are going to be ideal considering they have convenient usb and outlets located on every booth. its pretty new... practice your patience... it has a lot of potential.
over all a pretty good spot.  the outdoor patio and overall vibe is really good. food was excellent and unique.  i recommend the buffalo cauliflower. my wife had the crushed velvet drink and loved it.  the reason i only gave them 3 stars was due to the beer. they have a good selection but ran out of two of their wheat beers.  i tried 3 others. they were all very hop heavy in taste.  the first one was a witber, which should be smooth but had a strong after taste. i drank about half and told the server it was very hoppy and asked if they had anything smoother.  he brought me another brand. not as hoppy but still had a stronger taste.  not comparable to the brand i described to him. i was able to finish it. i tried one more brand but still had a strong finish.  my guess is the brands they were out of were the ones that were less harsh.  the server didnt seem very knowledgable about the brands that they serve. if you like ipas this is your place.  if you like beer like smithwicks, newcastle, leinenkugel, stella and smoother domestics, i would not recommend going here for a beer.  great vibe though. we will go back if friends pick the place. dont see us choosing this as our dts spot.
came for happy hour and wound up sitting outside, by myself for a while.  first off, why do they not have misters outside? everyone who came out later due to the bar area being full was complaining about the heat and the misters would have helped.  i didnt see any heaters either but maybe they plan to set up portable ones in the winter?  while it took a bit to get a waiter out to me i was kind of expecting it since i was the only one there.  he brought me a bottle of water and recommended a few beers to taste which i took him up on being able to taste the beers before you commit to a pint is really great.  he came back fairly quickly again to let me know that he put in the tastes and to take my food order.  the food came at a good pace tacos first then broccolini but i waited, and waited for the beer tastes and my cocktail.  he did come out to let me know the bar was backed up and i finally got my beer to taste and picked one still didnt have the cocktail.  my beer and cocktail finally came out after newer peoples drinks so my server said he was taking the drinks off the bill which i appreciated.however, i let him know i was ready for my bill and then waited, and waited, and waited again until another server who had come out to serve the filling outside area got me my bill.  so the missing two stars are for the slow service.the food was good and i will be back again to give it another go.  but a tip for others: friday happy hour is very popular so get there early!
good food. good drinks. good service. we ordered 2 lagunitas and a jungle juice and a coffee flavored beer. ahi tacos tarter tots mac and cheese grits pep pizza a burger mashed potatoes
this is a cool bar, they have decent service and good drinks  but they are a bit expensive.... i give it 3 stars since the service and drinks were good. id come earlier before they get too busy and also they may have a happy hour 
fun atmosphere, decor is school themed. i love the outside patio with giant jenga a beer pong tables.we ordered the tuscan chopped salad; kale, tomatoes, soppressata, burrata, crispy prosciutto. per the menu it was also supposed to have chickpeas but out of the whole salad we were only able to find one seriuosly, one!. but overall it was good, and a good size portion for sharing. the pizza we ordered was basic margherita, it was ok. the crust is thin which i like, but almost too thin towards the center so when you pick up a slice you have to fold it. i think it could have been cooked a bit longer? we had an awesome server, erin. she was really hustling for us. our group was ordering a lot of drinks, she was on top of it and she checked with us very frequently. so aside from erin, heres the kinks; the drink service could really use some work. it took a looooong time to get drinks. to give an idea, we sat down and ordered drinks right away. after about 5 min we were ready to order food. our food came out before we had even gotten our drinks!? this isnt the servers fault, they just need a better system at the bar. new place so it takes time. overall i like this place and i would recommend checking it out.
i came here for my birthday with my family we had a reservation , they greeted us at the door and said it would be a minute. we were seated with in 5 minutes. after that the trouble began, 15 minutes later they asked if we have been helped. he took are drink order and never asked if we wanted apps until the drinks came.after taking our order for apps it took 35 minutes for our food to come out. my pizza came out cold and sent it back. my wife had the chicken and waffles very good. my son had the fish and chips ok. my pizza finally came out and it was the same pizza warmed up and dry.would i come back??? i will give it another chance.
great food. poor service. took over an hour to seat 7 of us on a week night. everything took them a while. they didnt know their menu. we kept ordering beers that we found out much later they were out of but kept on the menu. most of us got our beers 45 mins after being seated. the food runners didnt know who ordered what, which is ok but then they didnt even know what the dish was called that they had. know your menu. music was too loud to have a conversation unless you talked to the person next to you and you were leaning in. i didnt enjoy shouting across the table. pros: the food was really good and they had very creative items on the menu. everything was fresh.
the food was good but i have an issue with this restaurant. it bills itself as a scratch gastro pub. first, the scratch: store bought bloody mary mix so easy to make this from scratch. the bar: out of brandy, cant make a pina colada or a toasted almond or a blue martini, doesnt carry decaf coffee had to go down stairs to crave restaurant to get a cup of decaf to go and bring it back up to make a decaf an baileys. the yellow thunder was very good.all of that aside; the chicken  waffles was excellent as was the steak salad. the cheese  bacon tater tots were also good. my favorite was the mac and cheese with chorizo. the cookie ice cream sandwich with nutella and bacon brittle outside was kind of gross.
i went last night with a couple of girlfriends to check it out. overall, it was just...decent. i like the theme and ambiance. they carried the school theme out very well in the decor and it was fun. we ordered food off the happy hour and regular menu. my friend got the parmesan fries, which were excellent, and the wings and cauliflower which she said were just okgood. my other girlfriend ordered the poblano and quinoa. the pepper was good but the rice was very bland; almost no flavor at all. for 16 not with it. i ordered the margherita pizza, which was good, once i got it. unfortunately, they forgot to make it so it took awhile. the good thing is they comped it, which was nice and done so without me asking. my only complaint is the drink prices. i spent 27 on two glasses of wine. and it was nothing special, just house chardonnay. 11glass is outrageous for a house glass of wine. i also noticed happy hour beers were very, very limited. regular cocktail prices were upwards of 1516 a piece. overall, it was decent. i probably wont go back unless it ends up being a meeting place decided on by others.
at the bar. very good service. but in the dining room it was a bit of a cluster fk. the service bar is way too small and the servers have to wait in line to get drinks. the bartenders rock but they dont have any room to appropriately place drinks upon completion. the happy hour menu is ok. but for the price, the portions are a bit too small. great atmosphere. huge room with an oversized deck. fun place with a lot of potential.
four of us came here; our first time.   we sat for nearly 15 minutes with no water or any acknowledgement that we were even there.  we finally grabbed a random server from another table that took our order.  appetizers:  calamari and tater tots.  both were good.our real server finally shows up and introduces himself after we ordered and already received our appetizers.  seriously!  where have you been the past half hour?  go away!dinner:  shrimp and grits...very flavorful, however another shrimp or two would have been nice.  shrimp and chorizo....flavorful, but again skimpy on the shrimp and chorizo; mostly mac and cheese.  burger....tasty, but a bit pricey at 14.  marguerite pizza.....good, but nothing special.dessert....lemon meringue pie served in a jar.  good flavor, a nice tart lemon flavor.pros:  nice atmosphere.  food was good.cons:  terrible service....slow, slow, slow!   skimpy on main ingredients in entrees.  loud....very, very loud!  turn down the music, please!  we had a difficult time hearing one another and kept having to repeat ourselves!  happy hour prices not honored in the restaurant.....not so happy happy hour!
we sat at the bar for happy hour. service was fine, no issues there and the place was deceivingly busy inside from outside, looked like it wasnt even open. liked the schooltype decor, down to the lined college ruled paper bar napkins. nice touch. thought it wouldve been cool to have gym themed locker rooms for their bathrooms, complete with moldy gym towels in a hamper...maybe that would be taking it too far?we had a drink prices not bad for happy hour and the flat bread with hummus and baba ganoush. both were awesome. the overall menu is very gastropubstyle and ill be back at some point to try some of their food. would also check out the outdoor seating, on a deck that is shaded in the afternoon. wise planing, very wise.
food is good, service is all over the place. forgetting orders throughout not just at our table. service needs to step up a lot.
im still on the fence.  i like the school theme concept.   from the actual menus to the entrees, the school theme is consistent.   i ordered the hummus babaganoushchick pea appetizer to share.  plenty of pita bread....they will bring you as much as you want, which if you are watching your carbs,  may not be a good idea.  the dips were ok, dont think ill order again.  for my entree i had the kale caesar salad.  didnt love seeing 2 sardines staring at me when they sat the salad in front of me, but i scooted them to the side.  it was a good amount of salad, but again not sure id order it again.  id like to go back and try some other options....ill keep you posted.
great atmosphere and vibe! good was ok nothing spectacular and it did takes us 30 minutes to get a drink...that we had ordered from two different waiters... they still need to work some crinks out
amazing food, terrible service. this was our first time here and we were so excited to try. the hostess was extremely rude to start when i told her we had a party of 8. we had no expectation of being seated right away so im not sure where her attitude came from. once we were seated we ordered some appetizers, waters, and drinks. there were four times where all 8 of us had empty glasses of water and had to ask someone to bring us more. i was never brought a refill on my lemonade i think the fresh lemonade was missing an ingredient so i was ok dealing with water without asking multiple times for one. one out of four of our appetizers never came out and we had to track down our waiter to remind him to bring it. the food came out and he never checked on our food or water. one bison burger was ordered medium well and was completely rare. it was picked at around the edges but barely eaten, but im sure it didnt phase the lazy waiter. when it was time for our 4 separate checks he pulled the our system cant do that bs and had us literally write down per couple what we had, the price of each item, add it all up, include tax and give him the tab at the end for him to ring up. it took about 20 minutes to write everything out and then the computer magically rang separate checks. now onto the good food: cauliflower buffalo appetizer was my favorite. we also tried the bacon cheese tots, chorizo mac n cheese, and the calamari, which were all a huge hit. i had the steak with truffle butter and mac n cheese. it was a good size portion and very tasty! my husband had the bison burger which was pretty good but his was also not cooked properly. the prosciutto pizza was alright but a little difficult to eat because the prosciutto is not cut up into pieces, and the chicken and waffles were great!
the food is delicious. the fig and prosciutto pizza is divine, but why is the service so terrible? it took 20 minutes to get our drinks, and even then they came one at a time. the waitress seemed like she didnt know what she was doing. i was not impressed with the staff but the food was good.
went here to meet with a girlfriend for happy hour. the place looks really cool, very open and spacious. great vibe. not too loud. i found our table easily.         the patio was nice, i joined our group and after... a while, our server got my drink order. eventually my drink came out. it was delightful, i think it was called a crushed velvet, it was refreshing and tasty and wonderful, served in a sweaty copper mug with lavender and blackberries it made me smile. i didnt meet the bar tender, but i know we would be the best of friends. now i was ready for some food, it was happy hour so i chose their pbj sliders. tiny burgers with peanut butter and jelly and bacon?! yes please. i waved down a server not ours because i hadnt seen her in... forever and asked her if i could order something to eat. she hunted down our girl and she took my order. the sliders came out in a timely manner, and they were delightful. the bacon was thick and cooked to perfection, and just the right amount of peanut butter and jelly really made these juicy burger babies pop. it was close to time for me to head downstairs to see a movie so i put on my best check please face and looked around for our server who was once again gone forever. i flagged down another server and asked if i could get my check as the rest of the party was staying but i needed to head out, she found our server from the abyss, i assume and she brought me the check. as she handed it to me i said can you hang on one sec, ill get you my card right now. and when i turned back around with my card and the bill, she was again gone. as it was now three minutes till i needed to be downstairs i went in and asked someone to run my check or find my girl. which they did and i speed walked to the movie and was alright.            even though our server was incredibly distracted and the other servers brought other tables food and drink to our table multiple times, and i heard everyones tales of how this is the standard for their service, ill still try it again. the food and drinks were awesome, the service just wasnt there. it wasnt the end of the world, but it almost made me late to see magic mike.
very interesting  unique concept. the food is all made from scratch and very yummy. the place is big but very loud. a mixed crowd but very young crowd as if you are in school. service could be better. will return in a few months to try other dishes.
food was okay. i had such high expectations since my husband raved about it. i will come back to try more things.  my favorite thing was the chorizo mac and cheese minus the chorizo.  chorizo pieces were too hard for my liking but the hubs said thats how its supposed to be, that real chorizo.  loved how it was topped with salt and vinegar potato chips. that way yummy. i kept going back for more! i had the short ribs which was very tender just not enough flavor for me. i needed salt. nutella cookie was good but i prefer soft gooey cookies, this one was a little hard. my husband said you could ask them to warm it up. next visit i do want to try the shrimp pasta, bison burger and lemon dessert :i did also find it strange that reservations over 6 need manager approval. i never got a callback to confirm. luckily plans changed and it was just a party of four so i was able to reserve on line.  service was good once we got there. waitress was nice and helpful and apologetic when dessert took some time. overall cool new spot, just have to find some favorite dishes.
ive heard great things about this restaurant, up until yesterday when a coworker of mine had nothing but poor words to spill. i didnt let this distract me from at least trying it...im glad i did. i probably wont be back though.let me tell you why. this restaurant is big. so big the echo of everyone talking makes you feel like youre in a cafeteria. so big the food, while good, ends up cold if you arent next to the kitchen. so big, it takes a server five minutes to get to one side and back....however, there are some big flavors here that i wouldnt shy away from. the tots are delicious, and the sriracha ketchup add the right kick to compliment the cheese and bacon filling. the chorizo mac n cheese had some great textures and a full bite with everything in it showed what this dish could do if piping hot. the jidori chicken  waffles was a hit. i hope they use the cornbread muffin as some sort of breakfast dish, because id eat it morning, noon, and night.i recommend trying public school. it has a lot to look at, a great beer selection, and a short, yet formidable cocktail list.
eh... i had high hopes for this place. the menu is good, but kind of eccentric. the beer selection is good, although they were out of a few. i have been here twice and sat at the bar both times during happy hour. my last visit, friend asked which vodkas were on the happy hour menu, then proceeded to order one of them with tonic. the menu says 5 well drinks during hh. when we got the check her three drinks were 9.75 each. she questioned the bartender  they argued a bit, but they did end up giving her the hh price. they told her she ordered a vodka that wasnt on the hh menu, when in fact i heard her order it  i know she did. the lighting is really bright which is kind of weird.it seems to be the place to be right now as its always busy. i still prefer the bar  staff at yard house.
atmosphere is alright. food is soso. however the buffalo cauliflower is super good!! drinks are good. they only have a select few beers and they are all craft. service is pretty good. probably wouldnt come back, nothing will make you want to choose this place over the other bajillion bars and amazing places to eat in vegas.
i came  to public school 702 on a wednesday night with my cousin. we had just finished watching a movie so we decided to check it out. the restaurant was easy to find and the host at the front was friendly. they have outdoor and indoor seating. we wanted to sit outside but the host informed us that we would have to wait so we opted to sit inside to avoid the wait and check out the restaurants decor.being a high school teacher, i absolutely adored the restaurants decor. it was decorated with school memoriabilia including trophies, books, etc. they also had an awesome solar system model hanging from the ceiling and other school themed canvases on the wall.the menus resembled composition notebooks which was a cute touch as well. the restaurant stayed true to its public school theme.as far as the food, we were not super hungry so we decided to order small. we asked the server for recommendations and she was able to give recommendations for each category which was nice. however, being that we do not eat pork, there were limited options of what we could get in the entree section. almost every dish has bacon in it, so if you love bacon, this is your place! the menu also seems to cater to an older crowd and seemed not so kid friendly. i did not see if there was a kids menu but im assuming they dont have one since most of the people in the restaurant were 21.we ended up ordering the buffalo cauliflower along with the irish stout braised  ribs. the buffalo cauliflower was actually pretty great. i am not a fan of cauliflower but it was perfectly breaded and tasted just like a buffalo wing. it was served with horseradish and buffalo sauce. i was okay with the buffalo sauce but absolutely hated the horseradish sauce. i figured they would at least have the option of ranch but the server said they did not serve ranch but they could offer aioli which i politely declined. im a ranch type of girl so i thought it was weird to have buffalo sauce flavored food without it. regardless of the ranch though, the buffalo cauliflower is definitely one to try. the irish stout braised ribs were also delicious. the runner for our food said it was the best entree on the menu and she was right! the meat was boneless and so tender. it paired up perfectly with the mashed potatoes served under it. i would definitely recommend ordering this dish!the atmosphere of the restaurant itself is calm and seems sort of like a lounge. our server was pleasant but took a while bringing us our check after we had asked for it. she stood by another table talking for almost 5 minutes so it was irritating to wait when we had asked for it before that. once we got our check, we saw that our meal came out to about 30 for the two dishes, which was not too bad i guess. the only issues i have with this place is not having ranch but also the server giving us our check late. other than those two issues, the place was nice to try and had tasty food! im giving it 3 stars because although it was good and a great place to try, i dont know if ill come back again by choice.
i came here on a wednesday night after watching a movie. this perhaps is my second or third time here at downtown summerlin. i just recently moved to the northwest of town from the south side. its definitely a much better atmosphere here. back to what matters, the drinks definitely seemed more appealing than the food menu. most options have bacon bits and being that i dont eat pork made it annoying. i ended up getting the crispy buffalo cauliflower and irish stout braised short rib to share. i definitely recommended both to try!!  it full of flavor and a great portion size. im really big on customer service and as a new spot i definitely feel like the staff our waitress in particular wasnt very attentive to discussing what was best to try and lacked knowledge of the menu. it took her 20 minutes for our check. overall it was cool and might visit again for the patio experience.
i may go back with friends for happy hour, but i would not go back for dinner. we enjoyed the buffalo cauliflower and my moscow mule was fine, however both of our salads  the steak and the ahi  were skimpy for the price. plus, the steak we asked for medium came out extremely rare, and i specifically asked for no tomatoes on the ahi, which our waitress forgot. it was so loud, too.  id like to try some beers  try some other appetizers sometime.
the decor is so cute and so is the idea of the restaurant! the reason why im giving three stars is because i feel like the menu is very limited and very standard. youre paying a lot for regular bar food, even during happy hour!
this place is so cute and different from any other restaurant bar. however, the food isnt amazing. its pretty normal. the menu is pretty small for both lunch and dinner. its a good place to drink with friends! they have a study group section in the menu where you can share a variety of different beers which is cool! id rather go to a more local bar for happy hour.
no bang for your buck here. the happy hour recess time is decent. we reviewed the lunch and dinner menu while we waited for our food. not much price difference from happy hour! like 1 difference. and this is just bar food. we got the crushed velvet. their version of a moscow mule with blueberry and blackberry flavor. we got the parmesan truffle frites, speck  eggs, crispy naked wings, and crispy ahi tuna tacos. the one thing that was worth it were the truffle fries and ahi tuna tacos. the food is decent. you can tell that they are trying to bring different flavor and style to their menu. the wings tasted like fried chicken and side note  they dont have ranch. it was worth a try, but honestly, i would not be back.
being a positive person i always look for the good in things. positives are public school is a cool idea grade a. cafeteria style seating indoors, but noisy grade b and outside is a large patio with lots of space to enjoygrade a. but thats where it ends. service was okay at best grade c , yes they were polite and positive grade b. the kitchen slowed them down and what they served was nothing i would be proud to turn in grade d. overall id give public school a  grade of c. to stand out in  downtown summerlin pubic school needs to take some extra credit and study a little harder.
came here a couple days ago. i know you guys are waiting for my review. this place isnt tooo shabby, its a nice hipster type of place. but, the food was just mediocre to say the least. im not gonna hop on the hype train like everyone else, im going to give you guys the real review. food was just ehh, you know how you tell your neighbors to keep it down. youre just like keep it downim like the food is ehhhhhhyou know what i mean, rather go bjs, lazy dog, or anywhere in dts!
we had a six top for a 6:30 reservation, table had four chairs looking into the setting sun.  youser! two employees said they were sorry but nothing got fixed.  the metal chairs were the worst chairs ever in the history of restaurants, owee.  the service was c at best, one person at our table had to school, no pun intended, the server on the beer selection.  once all the meals were ordered we did two appetizers, the cauliflower and the tots.  tots were great, cali was good.  the tots came out 30 seconds prior to our first dinner plates.  i have to say all the food was not hot, mostly warm.  not good.  the food tasted good and the presentation was good as well.  we ordered the giant cookie for desert, one plate for six of us????  ok then, it was good though.  overall food was good, warm at best, service well below average, loud and uncomfortable.  we probably will not return.
great food menu. great beer  wine menu. absolutely terrible service. ive given it three tries because the cauliflower appetizer is amazing...but every time ive gone back the service has been worse than the time before. very disappointing.
went here in a party of 4 this saturday night. the place has very cool decor that sticks with the school theme. the menus were cool how they looked like composition books. we sat in the communal dining area because there was a 45 minute wait for the private tables and the bar was full. our waitress was very friendly however we were waiting on our drinks forever. i ordered a steak salad and our friends had a burger. the atmosphere was social but the music and the loudness of everyones conversation was definitely clashing. our friends got their food about 5 minutes before us... i thought this was very unprofessional as we were telling our friends to go ahead and start eating and they felt awkward eating in front of us. we had ordered mediumwell for both the burger and the steak salad and when we got our food, both cuts of meat were very pink. i almost sent my steak salad back but i knew it would take even longer to get it and we had already been waiting a while. the salad lacked flavor and i ended up asking for lemons and vinegar to season it myself. i would still go again here but i would choose something else on the menu and order welldone to avoid having an almost still mooing cow delivered on my plate.
i would love to give this restaurant 5 stars, because not only do i love the food and the beer selection, i love the atmosphere. but ive gone there on three different occasions and have had rude, rude, rude extremely rude service. not only by a server, but a bartender and a manager. i will definitely start logging names because as an employee in the service industry myself i cant believe how entitled the employees are when a customer isnt happy with their meal or is just asking questions. my fiance and myself had a manager laugh in our faces when we had a question regarding the menu and wanted the price to be adjusted based on how it was described.there really needs to be a little customer service training for all the employees and managers. employees, guest and customers alike need to understand quality customer service comes from quality customers and severs. i hope sooner than later the quality of service changes because its actually a great place in a great location especially to have such shitty service and managers!!!
accommodating to my special diet request, but service was very slow, felt over priced for a salad... but flavor profiles were good. expected more.
i went for an alumni happy hour event on 827 and was pleasantly surprised at how packed the place was for it being 5:30 pm on a thursday. thy didnt have much signage on the ground level so it took me a minute to find from the backside of the mall, but thats an easy fix. i enjoyed their flat breads and crispy tater tots with spicy ketchup. the service was definitely spotty, we had a sassy waitress that at one point told us  sorry, we are not taking drink orders right now, the bar is too busy. i thought that was pretty interesting since we were at a bar, a place that most likely relies on a huge portion of revenue from their bar sales. so i told her, damn you guys must not want to make money. so she unhappily said she would put our drink orders in and low and behold my beer came out within 2 minutes. the 3 hours i was there, i was able to barely get two drinks from our server who only asked if i needed anything else at the end of the night when the place cleared. i wont judge this place on the bad service though because i have heard good things and will definitely return just maybe when they are not too busy to serve me a drink.
public school gets an a for decor and an a on the food. its hand held cobb is a solid piece that id be happy to have every time im here. the fries are the weakest link but only because theres nothing really different about them. my only complaint is that i ordered a diet coke and it comes in a bottle in which youre charged for refills.sorry guys, but the majority of your competition gives those away. a 2.75 soda plus 1.50 refills...not good.
the food is amazing. a lot of drinks to choose from. its really awesome they have jenga and beer pong. i docked major stars and would give service alone 1 star. our waitress karissa was horrible. sat down and waited ten minutes to get drink orders. she forgot to get my sons order. as she took our drink orders she goes over and talks to another worker for about five minutes then finally goes outside to her other table. i understand when people are busy but she was talking half the time and seemed like she could give two shits. i will give this place another try but maybe for drinks with friends. also its weird they have steak but no a1 or steak sauce? they brought bbq sauce??! even fine dining steak houses and chillis have a1 i mean come on. at least a busser , of course not the server she was mia, had the courtesy to bring out some kind of sauce for my husband.
fun place and some different menu options... it always seems to be very busy.... service is pretty good... 2 downfalls... 1 music in bar area is like being in a rave and its so loud the last 3x i was there i left with no voice from trying to speak over the music... 2 they dont seem to have enough glasses because ive been served wine 5 times in a hot glass fresh out of the dishwasher... glad its clean but not very good for the wine.
it a great start to the evening.youre playing a friendly game of shuffleboard as we wait! brittany the food quality or serving times were poor. that is being kind the waitress did her best but the food was cold came out at all different intervals. we here this was great but more like a hipster night club loud music your mileage may very!
great location.  i enjoyed the food,  although my husband wasnt impressed will his frito pizza.   its very up close and personal.  the guests sit very close to one another.  the music is ridiculously loud,  so you cant hear what the person next to you is saying.  i guess that could be good or bad,  depending on who you are with.   i liked my party of 4, so felt the noise was a bit much.  it looks like they are going for a young crowd, with the music and noise, but attract a variety of ages.... they should consider toning it down to fit into their clientele.
the food here was very good except for the frito pie pizza, which didnt even remotely resemble frito pie at all, but the atmosphere was awful. the music was so loud we could hardly carry on a conversation, we had to yell our orders to the waiter, and we couldnt hear anything he said about the specials. the tables are incredibly close together so as to be uncomfortable. the grown ups at the table next to us were throwing coins at each other and nobody told them to knock it off besides another table of customers, with their glares, who were on the receiving end of some of those coins. our waiter was great about refilling our waters in the beginning but didnt pay us as much attention as he should have during our meal. cool decor, though. and maybe a visit for lunch would be better. stay away on a friday night.
lets start with the positive. the food is quite good and original. bacon taters tots and mezze plate hummus, naan, babaganoush were tasty appetizers. bison burger was good, though my medium came to me closer to rare. wife said her steak salad was good. beer and cocktail menu are very good. service was soso. we had reservations, but still got seated in one of the worst tables in the house right by the main entrance. uncomfortable metal chairs, wobbly table. also, our main courses were served 5 minutes after they dropped our appetizers. hate that. ambience is ps 702s real weakness. this place is cavernous, uninspired in its decor, bizarre in its traffic flow, and ridiculously, jarringly, loud. i mean, canthearthepeopleatyourowntableloud. punctuated by unexplained buzzer alarms like you might hear just before the nuclear meltdown.im glad we gave it a try, but doubt ill be back. although the food was pretty good, the environment made me feel i was rushing through a meal at a theme park food plaza. not for everyone, i suppose.
good not great. nice selection of beers and the service was good although our server was a quiet talker and we could barely hear her over the din.  thats right its not a quiet spot. nice decor though and cute keeping with the school theme.ordered the crispy ahi tacos which could have used a bit more acid and a pinch of salt but overall tastybacon and cheddar tater tots were really tastybuffalo cauliflower was good with one hitch.  on the larger pieces of cauliflower there was uncooked batter in the nooks and crannies.  a bit of a turn off.fish and chips were tasty but really greasy as well.  my wife took all the cocktail napkins on the table to soak up the oil and they were all soaked. i ordered the huntsman burger which our server recommended i order medium.  i opted for medium rare  my personal preference.  burger came out medium.  a bit disappointed but not a  deal killer.some minor hiccups and i will probably give them another shot but if its still mediocre that may be the last time.  if a place bills itself as a gastropub i expect some innovative food.  not the case today.  time will tell.
ive been wanting to check this place out for awhile since it has consistently been getting good reviews. i went with my husband around dinner time on a friday and we only had to wait 20 minutes which wasnt too bad. the first thing you notice when you walk in is how unbelievably loud it is.  it was so loud the hostess was having difficulty communicating where to seat people.  they walked a little ways in, and it started to get quieter, but then we were seated directly under a blaring speaker.  we still managed to get in some dinner conversation, but it did detract from the experience overall.we ordered the chorizo mac and cheese as an appetizer.  it came practically within a minute of ordering it, which was great for timing, but it also means it was already prepared and waiting for us to order it. im not even sure they had to mix it based on how fast it came. the mac and cheese alone was actually pretty boring.  adding the potato chips gave it a crunch and depth of flavor that helped.  the chorizo was pretty standard, nothing spectacular.  if you managed to get all four things on your fork at the same time it was good, but not great.  because the appetizer was out so quickly, we waited about 15 minutes for entrees after the appetizer was finished.  my husband had the steak salad for his entree.  it was supposed to have a white truffle vinaigrette on it.  he assured me that it did lightly taste of truffle, but honestly i couldnt taste it myself.  perhaps my flavor palette is off.  the salad overall was tasty and had a bunch of different things mixed in.  we ordered the steak medrare and it came medwell, but it was still delicious.i ordered the stout braised ribs as my entree and it was fantastic.  the ribs fell apart as soon as you put your fork to them, the gravy was so flavorful, and it was all served on top of yukon gold mashed potatoes.  it was absolutely wonderful.when the bill came it was over 60 which i think wasnt consistent with the experience i had there.  at those prices, i will head next door to fogo when it opens for lunch.  i may go back to try out recess which is their happy hour, but i will not be returning for dinner.
first time here for happy hour. got the chorizo mac and cheese, it was tasty. we also tried the frito pie, homemade chili, cheese, red onions pickled jalapenos, it was dry and uninspired and definitely not a chill. then we tried the american sidekicks three mini cheeseburgers, all bun with a small meatball of a burger that was dry and over cooked. so all in all, its a pass on this one.
great decor and waitress was very attentive so thats the three stars.  food was boring.  frito dish was suppose to be chili over fritos with cheese and pickled  jalapenos.  it was just taco meat over fritos with a little cheese cream sauce.  very dry and uninspired.   sliders were tiny dry burger rounds on oversized buns.   chorizo mac and cheese was excellent.
dearest public school 702,i want to like you so badly, but your service sucks. you should get on that. k tnx. ericka. but for real. i love downtown summerlin and its contemporary dining offerings so i keep getting drawn to this place. the atmosphere is fine, its like an interpretive, modern take on a schoolhouse and i guess thats the point. the food is a little above 3 stars. the flavors of the green chili chicken and cornbread waffles threw me off at first, but i definitely left wanting more. bacon cheddar tots are total comfort food. tried to be healthy one time so i ordered the kale caesar with salmonsalmon was cooked well, but the dressing was bland. all the makings to be a cool friday night neighborhood barrestaurant, but i just cant get passed the service. every time we come here, weve had to wait for water, drink orders, food, you name it. just this last friday night, they brought our appetizer out super quick, but turned out to be for another table so they took it back!!! and then ours was another 2030 minutes. yep.
the decor is cool and appropriate, the foh staff is nice and friendly. our orders were taken well and given some good suggestions. they need some more popular beers on tap though, not just forcing you to drink a craft beer. the menu had some nice and some not nice ideas. i ordered the flat iron steak medium rare and it came rare, way too many potato chip on top of the mac and cheese it came with. also found a old dried out piece of canadian bacon in my mac and cheese, turned me off to the whole meal after that. decent ideas for food but you probably have inexperienced cooks behind the line cause from experience thats what it seems like to screw up such an expensive but simple dish. probably wont come back for a long time. grape street is still way better.
public 702 is located in downtown summerlin over crave. the inside is intelligently designed with old, retro school items such as lunch boxes, pom poms, megaphones in display cases and old bleachers nailed to the wall. the menu looks like a black and white speckled composition book and the napkins are lined notebook paper. very smart marketing. food was quite good, each item ordered was said to be delicious. appetizers were buffalo cauliflower, mac and cheese, bacon and cheese tater tots. food ordered, huntsburger with brown bag fries, chopped salad, roasted poblano with stuffed veggies and quinoa, fried chicken and waffles. so why 3 stars? our server!! our dinner took 3 hours. i repeatedly saw her in the server hallway eating and talking to the other servers. she took 15 minutes to come over to us after we were seated, another 15 to come back with drinks, she disappeared while we waited to place our food orders, once other servers delivered our food, then not once were we checked on to see if we needed anything, my husband had no utensils. when we were finished, we kept waving down other servers to get our server for the check. our server never arrived. another server finally brought us our check. our table time from sit down to leaving was almost 3 hours. doubt id go out of my way to go back, ill try other restaurants in the area.
the service was atrocious.  the food was okay and the drinks were delicious.  i think with time they will work out the kinks, they have a good concept just failed on the delivery.
note: this review is for drinks only. the mac n cheese looked crazy good! i sat at the bar during happy hour. there are some decent food deals. some drinks specials, but never, of course, their best beer offerings. i paid 11 for a pint! while a good, unique beer, 11 was too too much. and it took over 10 mins for me to be approached by the bartender though, to her credit, she seemed really busy. and it nearly as much time to get my check. not cool. but again, the bar was understaffed. the space itself it nice. the beer offerings are good. there are plenty of tvs to watch the game. theres a nice outdoor area. the food looked tasty. but the staff are...underwhelming and unattentive. no one greeted me upon entry or exit. i cant say ive ever had that happen before. but the sour apricot beer was excellent. though, not sure it was 11 excellent.
i do not understand the big deal about this place.  food was okay.  service was okay.  just okay
service: walked in, and the hostess doesnt even greet us. we had to look through the crowd at the entrance to determine who it was. they had the hostess at the front, and looking straight down at her tablet for their seating. we had to approach her in order to initiate any kind of conversation.service after we sat down was ok. just make sure to get order what you need when you see the server, it takes a minute for them to get to you.food: i read a review below that indicated nothing really stood out. i agree with that review. nothing really stood out, which is not necessarily bad, but also not good. restaurants need a specific dish or two to stand out and make guests think, i want to go there again! watermelon tomato appetizer was mediocre. ive been to places that were able to use a balsamic dressing to complement the sweetness of watermelons perfectly. here, i believe they are trying to do too much with the dressing. the yellow tomato was kind of confusing. the first piece my girlfriend and i had were bland, the second piece on the bottom had more flavor. charcuterie board was nothing really special. i would prefer to go down the street to hearthstone for a better selection.chicken and waffles was also missing something. perhaps the thick cut bacon is what never does it for me. im more a crispy bacon kind of person. that bacon made the gravy really chunky, and not as appealing as it could have been. the corn bread waffle could have use an extra minute in the waffle iron. they serve the chicken on top of the waffle, and slightly covered in the gravy, and an extra side of that same gravy. i would recommend getting that gravy on the side so that your fried chicken doesnt get soggy.
a coworker had an early lunch here last thursday, and had an amazing experience he got the huntsman, the cauliflower, and pepperoni pizza all loved!. however i, on the other hand, did not. i called in an order of pizza. the order taker was very kind and triple checked all my info. when i arrived there were a bunch of people blocking the doorway, waiting for tables, and unwilling to let me through. once i make it past, and to the barpickup, i can see my food sitting on the cold counter. i was rather upset.the bartender was very nice, greeted me in under a minute, attended to my order immediately, and with a smile. did my best to be nice back, but couldnt shake the agitation of my food sitting out. i falsely assumed it would remain under a heat lamp until pickup. my guess is it sat for 510m, as it was lukewarm once i got to my car. overall, ill give this place one more try, maybe... but only as diningin, and only when its slow. id advise people to never do takeout.
food was original and tasty. ordered 3 appetizers during happy hour. they came out 15 min apart. dreadful service and the place was only about 75 percent full. probably wont be back.
i have eaten here 4 times with 4 different friends. the conclusion that i have reached is that the back of the house food is well run while the front of the house wait and bar staff is not. their menu is creative and the food is quite good. in the past i have ordered the brussels sprouts salad, the shrimp and grits and the salmon. the food was delivered in a timely manner. however, they have staffing issues. on the server side, i think they are just short of experienced servers. the couple of times that i did not eat at the bar the server had a trainee with them. if the restaurant succeeds, this should correct itself.my criticism of the bar staff is more problematic. with the exception of one nice fellow, simon,  the boss bartender and the other staff were condescending and slow to serve. i felt as if somehow i did something wrong or that i was sitting at the losers table.  las vegas is home to the the worlds best hospitality workers. cant they find people that like other people and want to make them feel welcomed?  each time i have been to the restaurant i have had a similar experience. managers wake up! you have a not nice, too cool for school attitude percolating in the front of the house.
okay food, nice environment, average service at about 35 person. might go back again next year for a second chance!
food was wonderful, but the service was not good. reservations were made weeks in advance for a birthday luncheon for 12. they were not busy yet it was 30 minutes before drinks arrived. after our food came the server never came back to refill drinks. we obviously were celebrating a birthday...balloons and birthday decorations, but they brought the check without even asking if we wanted dessert. i was very disappointed and embarrassed as the host of the party. i had been several times before and had much better service so i thought it would be a great place to being friends for a party.
the atmosphere is cute, but the chairs are definitely not comfy. the food has that weird fusion vibe, but the mac  cheese was delicious so well worth it! we also added jungle juice to our dinner and that was yummy too!
i came in today for happy hour.  happy hour prices are fair. hh beer is 12 off on select pints. beer selection is good, but not necessarily for hh price ! hh food is still on the pricey side in my opinion. hh ahi tuna fish tacos 7, 4 smaller than average street tacos; taste decent. hh chicken wings 6 very good, worth it! hh chorizo maccheese 7 normal 10. terrible! worst maccheese ever. cheese is runny and bland, like they thinned in milk. was served in cast iron dish, but some how the cheese is still runny, did you forget to bake it?! chorizo is spanish style and cured; i was expecting mexican style, but menu doesnt clarify. salt and vinegar lays potato chips on top added for crunch, but was not fully crumbled and made the dish difficult to eat. kale is added, so i can pretend that the dish healthy, but does nothing to taste. our server mark was great, truly understanding, and helpful. my recommendation for this place go for the beer and atmosphere only! food is soso, but pricey.
for a soft open mistakes was made.order and they forgot to cook our order that we placed.order kalbi short ribs and bbq chicken. very little for the cost. 2 kalbi and 1 piece of bbq chicken which had no taste. should of been 2 pieces of each meat. you know local people from hawaii. we can eat! 11.99 is expensive for what they give. sorry youll leave here hungry.spoke to i believe the owner and told her my feeling as she apologized for the mistake. chicken no taste and very little food. may be later one down the road ill give them a try again, but for now ill go the my other favorite local dining in lv.
soft opening... so i will give this place another try.  ordered 1lb shoyu poke.  it took kinda a long time since they mix it fresh.  flavor was good.  the fish was a bit stringy though and i got a few scales.  i realize this is the mainland, but when you pay nearly 18lb i expect not to have to spit like eating sunflower seeds.    also had quite a bit of chilli peppa so not quite palatable for kids.  people including myself also ordering had 1.25, 1.22 lbs.  geez they ordered 1 lb, not 25 more than what they had asked for.  talk about upsale!  i was a little irked that mine was also weighed with cover.probably the best flavor poke i had in vegas so far, but not they greatest fish...  i will try them again in a few weeks.
honestly its like ll but way over priced. the only thing they have that ll doesnt is the poke. restaurant is very awkward, maybe they should play some music? other wise everything was alright.
first time, we got kalbi beef short rib plate and garlic shrimp plate and one hawaiian sun 28 frickin nuts! i felt like it was way too expensive. the kalbi was good but onlygave 3 pieces, for 12 4 short ribs would have been better. plate lunch comes with side mac salad and kimchee. mac salad was bland lacking in flavor, kim chee didnt taste fresh. i was disappointed in my garlic shrimp. no garlic flavor, drenched in butter like soaked. i tasted more lemon butter flavor than garlic. to me growing up in hawaii, im sorry it did not taste like back home. good service,clean. since they are new ill give them a second chance, but i will never order the shrimp again. good marketing, they give you one free tshirt!!
it was my first time here. the place was really clean and the cashier was really nice. i ordered a bbq mix with chicken and beef. total was 12.96. the chicken was great, the beef not so much. i will be going back and trying other items in the menu.
i went here for poke, and walked out without trying any. instead, i ordered the combo chicken katsu, bbq chicken, and spicy pork plate. the price is a bit steep for what they give you. one piece of spicy pork. what?katsu was good, but i did not like their katsu sauce very much, but thats because im very used to the typical standard. theirs is a bit different. the breading was good, and i enjoyed it. the bbq chicken is a definite must. i liked it the most out of the three. spicy pork was really off on flavor. i was expecting a korean standard spicy pork marinade but it was 1 not spicy at all 2 a different cut of meat than i expected 3 flavor had some sour vinegary taste that i was put off by, it just was not good. definitely nothing like the spicy pork youd expect at a korean restaurant. i let the cashier know, and thankfully she went out of her way to do a taste test. too bad that they stopped making it spicy to cater to the american taste buds due to some complaints. american people complaining about something being spicy when its called spicy pork. tickles my fancy. either way, they seem to respond very well to their customers comments, almost to a fault. there will always be someone that isnt going to be happy with the food. but i say bring back that spice level for the spicy pork. its like mc donalds has warned you the coffee is hot coffee. well, id say people have been warned plenty if it says, spicy pork. now your combo plate will not come with kimchi because of some complaint that they were served kimchi that went bad. and apparently a lot of people waste it and throw it out. what a bummer. its super rare to eat spoiled kimchi because its fermented. thats like saying i had spoiled pickles. now how often does that happen?the service was great, and the cashier was super nice. so yeah, didnt get that poke because the price was crazy for the small size. the marinade for their bbq chicken is one of the best ive ever had. it was perfect and had a great char. not too salty, not too sweet, it was super balanced.
meat jun was really good just the prices was too extreme for a plate. the poke was over priced everything was actually over priced , not even a 5 star restaurant and prices arent reasonable .
i have to agree the prices were a bit high for the quantity of food. they did not have everything available. one menu on the wall is different than the one by the register. it was a disappointing experience. not sure i would go back
had the 3 meat combo of meat jun, kalbi, shoyu chicken 15 and half pound shoyu poke 10. very comparable to most hawaiian style places, none really stood out and was more on the bland side if anything. drove half hour and went there about 2 weeks ago and can say it still is on the way to make it a good place or will fall like any other plate lunch joint. the prices are not your typical plate lunch price high but poke is about the going rate. when you up charge for not bad but not great food only hurts the patrons in 2 ways: would you go out of the way to get it? is it worth what you pay for if you can go somewhere else for the same items? they should probably downsize the menu and create more consistent choices because thats what it tasted like, something sitting because its on the menu and not so much an item thats freshly made to order. overall clean restaurant and kinda friendly staff and would probably try it one more time if were in the near area.
this hooters currently connects to the pool.  we were starving after laying out in the sun for a couple of hours and this was the most convenient option. you cant take any drinks ordered inside the place to. the pool but you can take the food.
staff was friendly, food was surprisingly good. i have been less that impressed at other hooters but this was a nice experience after a long tiring day of travel.
i paid 200 for a used, refurbished clothes dryer, which included delivery and installation, plus a 3 month warranty.
a great cafe for catching up with a friend or a casual meeting. its best quality is its design, because the space is absolutely beautiful! as a staple for daytoday though, the coffee is not quite there, at least yet. it is still very new, so the baristas may be new also, but i hope that tommy can someday become a staple.my recommendation: sit up the stairs in the loft, get a couple of lattes  one for you, one for a good friend  and enjoy the beautifully designed space.
a very cute, casual, hip environment but disappointed by the food. chai tea latte was watery, we ordered three sandwiches for take away and one was wrong and the chocolate croissant was dry. its unfortunate that the food was so bad considering the environment and location.
came here on a sunday afternoon with a friend. i have to admit, i had seen a picture of their cafe on instagram, and that is why i was intrigued. the decor was incredible  i believe they had restored the british empire building, so all the original architecture and moldings were in tact. they also had a top floor with a couch area and fun trinkets. and the ceiling decor was gorgeous! thats where the praise ends, unfortunately. i had a mocha with soy milk. it came up to about 8 with tip. way overpriced, in my opinion. the washrooms were clean, but neither stall had any toilet paper left...which just shows the upkeep.  as well, my friend and i had met up for lunch i had seen on their social media that they do serve food and they have a lunch special marked on their menu. they told us that they didnt have any sandwiches or salads that day... hmm. i didnt want to eat any baked goods for lunch, so we enjoyed the architecture for a bit with our drinks and then headed to the next door cafe for food. soo promising, but unfortunately, disappointing.
decor incroyable et juste pour cet attrait, ce cafe en vaut le detour. en terme de qualite des boissons, lespresso et le latte sont bien mais sans plus. cest egalement assez cher meme pour le vieuxmontreal  et lors de ma visite, les patisseries ne me semblaient pas des plus fraiches.  concernant lenvironnement, on y travaille bien, cest plutot tranquille et tres bien amenage tables longues, plusieurs comptoirs, wifi efficace et des bouteilles deau disposees un peu partout. je reviendrai certainement si je suis dans le coin du vieuxmontreal.
le local est super mais le cafe est juste bon et le service loin du super... jai malheureusement ete decue alors que javais de belles esperances denfin voir un cafe de type chouette cafe de quartier dans  le vieux. helas, les pris sont trop eleves pour la qualite.
oh hey, another cafe opening.. opened a couple of days ago in the rosepatrie neighborhood that is solely lacking in everything.i wont tell you about the decor and shit as with the many cafes opening up recently, looks are very deceiving. mind you, its not bad coffee but its not earth shattering that you have to go here.the beans are from pilot roasters and pilot is middle of the road so i wouldnt go out of my way for it. if you live in the neighborhood, like me for example, its a decent alternative.its done better than og but nowhere near odessa and since i want the best for the money spent, this is not it for me.might go back to try their nitro cold brew and see where it stacks up against lartiste affame but other than that, it doesnt satisfy me
cafe hipster, ca commence a faire beaucoup dans le quartier! super local, design soigne. cafe un peu amer mais excellente execution.
belle place pour le midi. la carte des sandwichs est interessante, par contre, demandez moins de sauce ave la poutine!
im a fan of thrifty joes. this store has a good selection of the books i tend to like: nature essays, history, historical fiction and regional books.  the selection changes literally everyday depending on what people happen to bring in. also the prices are great.  some new books area available too and they always seem to have a great number of copies of all those book that are required reading in the local high schools.i do wish, however, the ambiance of this store was kicked up a bit.  there is nowhere comfortable to sit and browse through your pile of picks to decide what to buy. there is no coffee available. there are never any book signings by local authors or other events to bring people into the store.  the store is neat and organized though. i wish they would take a page from the changing hands playbook and get it in gear to drive more people to the store to both buy and sell.the book selling process is easy and simple. bring your books, dvds and games in on a day the book buyers are there almost everyday and you just wait while they sort through what they will take and what is going home with you or to the goodwill across the street. the book buyers are careful and they seem to select wisely.  i have found some real treasures in these stacks over the years.
the drinks were good the service was awful. the bartenders there were soo rude and werent very accommodating. the music was ok. i may go back in the future.
i was invited to come to cafe 6 by pr at the palms and was comped our meal.  we arrived when they opened at 5 pm and were seated along the window that faces the palms place pool.  menus were left and in a very short time, our server, alejandro, arrived to take drink orders.  he was soon back with our two iced teas.i had a question about the burn your face off burger and with alejandros description, i opted to go with something that would leave my face in tactoverhaul though it needs.  i ordered the land and sea burger which the menu describes as angus beef, crab dynamite, red onions, fennel, arugula, breakfast radishes, havarti cheese, tomato tartar sauce, hawaiian sweet bun.  i asked for it rare and thats the way it came.  my wife ordered the dr. peppershroom burger that the menu describes as angus beef, roasted portabella, white cheddar, caramelized onions, dr. pepper glaze, dijon mustard, brioche bun done medium which was the way it was done.  we each ordered skinny fries which come with your sandwich.both burgers were very good.  i was pleased that my burger was indeed rare, something that some restaurants are hesitant to do.  the burgers were very largeprobably 8 ounces.  my burger, while having a good amount of crab, didnt have much of a crab taste.  the crab was mined and mixed with a hot sauce to be the dynamite mentioned in the menu.  there wasnt much dynamite to it, but the burger was good.  the skinny fries were salted in the kitchen and were the perfect accompaniment to the burger.for dessert, we split the to die for chocolate which the menu describes as chocolate ice cream, frozen brownie bites, toasted marshmallows, creme anglaise.  this was very good.  very chocolateyvery worthy of its name!throughout our meal, service was top notch.  our iced teas were refilled without needing to ask.  alejandro was very good!cafe 6 would probably rate another star if there was more of a choice.  except for burgers and sandwiches, there are only two main course optionssalmon and steak fritesso its a burger and sandwich cafe with some apps, salads, and desserts.  there is an option to build your own burger.  the price of the burgers amounts to strip pricing in an offstrip place.  while the room and the view of the pool are very nice, this isnt a stop id make.  its much easier to get gourmet burgers in the neighborhood at more reasonable prices.  for tourists staying at the palms or palms place, this is a perfectly good option.
we were invited to cafe 6 at palms place for a comped meal.  located on the 6th floor, this hideaway has a very inviting, upscale feel, with floortoceiling windows overlooking the pool.we were attended to immediately by jeannette, our wonderful server.  though the restaurant has what looks like a classy, full bar, there is no cocktail list.  there is no wine list.  instead, the restaurant is selling off what remains from its predecessors wine collection, and will not be replacing it.  huh????the only riesling available was the one we both dislike.  instead i ordered an ace pineapple cider from the beercider menu, and hubby had a sierra nevada.   if you dont like either, youre sol.  or, you could have a millioncalorie shake to go along with your this is not health food meal.  theyre probably delicious.  fattening stuff always is except for fried twinkies.  it is nice that they stock a selection of local brews, but as a nonbeer drinker, the lack of wine is a huge turnoff for me.  the pineapple cider was interesting  tasty, but too sweet even for me.we started with the baked soft pretzel, an enormous creature served with dijon mustard  warm cheese sauce.  loved it, but needed to make room for dinner, so it was the first entry in the takehome bag.we ordered a dr. peppershroom burger for me, without the dr. pepper glaze.  i never liked that soda, but did want all the other stuff on it:  the roasted portabello, white cheddar, caramelized onions, and dijon mustard on a brioche bun.  i asked for it medium, and it was slightly less than that, but in the good ol days i would get my burgers mediumrare, so i was fine with it, health dept. be damned.mr. g. got the smokehouse burger, and he enjoyed it a lot.  we ordered one with onion rings and one with waffle fries, welldone.  the onion rings were humungous, and i didnt dare eat more than one.  the waffle fries were perfect:  crisp, welldone but not burnt, simply scrumptious.  i couldnt even finish my burger, and we took home a lot of fries and the remaining onion rings.we finished up with dessert  the to die for chocolate.  we were too full to go the whole nine yards, so we asked for the ice cream to be served and all the other stuff packed to go.  we did miss the beautiful presentation that ive seen in some of the photos posted here, but the three scoops of chocolate ice cream that were served to us made me almost comatose, cause i ate too much of it.cafe 6 has a lot going for it:  great atmosphere, big and tasty burgers, rings, fries, pretzels, desserts, stellar service.  but not so great menu:  just two entrees, a few sammiches that dont sound particularly enticing, a bar that looks like a bar, but maybe its just a mirage oh, thats a different hotel, strip pricing.  if youre craving a burger and a beer, this may just be your place.
been here twice this week. the service was slow, and not the friendliest. the burgers were just ok. the frys and the onion rings were really greasy. would not go back
this is really a 3.5 rating...i wish yelp gave us that option.cafe 6 is located at the palms place. not palms hotel and casino...but you can still access the restaurant via their sky tube. just a bridge to cross over to the palms place. we got a table that overlooked their pool deck. very peaceful and serene. appetizer:beer battered rock shrimpstrips of carrots and celery mixed in a tabasco ranch dressing. oh my. this was freakin delicious!!!!! portions was perfect for an appetizer...for small eaters like myself, this is enough to get your halffull....even if this was shared. i would totally order this as an entree. its that good.burgers:short rib sloppy joe 15.95. angus beef, 100 short rib pepper joe mix, skinny fries, onion ring, hoagie bun. fried food galore. you got your skinny fries inside the burger, your big onion rings and then more fries on the side. i opted for the waffle fries. i put my remaining sloppy joe mix on top of these and mmmm.....yum!!!!!! they need to come up with something like waffle fries with the sloppy joe mix, pour some melted cheese on it and boom! sloppy joe cheese waffle fries. ohhh yess!!!my boyfriend ordered the mini burgers 3 mini sliders of the bacon bleu 13.95 which consist of angus beef, applewood smoked bacon, bleu cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, housemade ketchup, brioche bun. he really enjoyed his. he liked cafe 6 more than i did actually....and hes not really a fan of burgers either. so why 3 stars? as much as these burgers were delicious, it didnt really give me the wow at first bite. the appetizer rocked more than my burger. we went on a sunday evening...peak dinner hours but there were only about 45 other tables. hopefully this place can survive.
our first time here.  tried the smoke out burger and the short rib sloppy joe burger.  the flavor of the smoke out was yummy but the brisket on it was a bad combination of being  chewy and fatty.  the sloppy joe burger we would not choose again, our expectation was of a coarsely chopped rib meat but was of completely ground meat.  next time we would choose a build your own burger and add the slaw and bbq sauce which was very yummy. the portions were large and the sweet potato fries and onion rings were included and plentiful. service was very good also.  we will try again soon.
first off, most of my meal was comped, but that does not guarantee a good review. this place took over the old simon restaurant and it doesnt look like they changed much. the decor is the same and aside from them using their wine rack to store beer, the place is the same.their menu skews a bit too far casual, with almost all hamburger and sandwiches on the menu and only two entrees. that might be fine for lunch, but the lack of refined options doesnt make it a dinner destination.based on early reviews, their pretzel was a must. it didnt disappoint with its butterbrushed, warm and soft exterior making it a wonderful appetizer, if not highly original. the large size is a thing to behold and the cheese and mustard sauces are irresistable.burgers may look a tad small, but theyre plenty filling. the smoke out burger, with its meaty and densely packed patty were well executed. paired with a pretzel bun and a tangy bbq sauce its a solid burger thats only downfall was fatty and tough brisket. it was tough to eat in the metal basket that it arrived in, but thats a small drawback for a good burger and delicious waffle fries.theres no kids menu or more importantly, kidsized portions but there are options for  them. chicken tenders are typically a favorite for any kid. mine, however, was turned off by the abundance of pepper and paprika that proved too much for his young palate.theres potential here. the execution was good for the most part, but the menu is too casual for the vibe of palms place. its in need of higher class fare  at least that would be my perception if i stayed here. at the very least they should consider expanding their menu to have separate breakfast, lunch and dinner options.
not my favourite. service is friendly however the food and bagels are average and dont measure up to the deli across the street. i absolutely hate the ordering and payment system order at one computer at  and pay another. i dont see the hype and honestly  it is not my favourite bagel place. they easily get overwhelmed once there are a few people in line. i ordered the nova lox bagel and they barely gave me any smoked salmon!
pros: easy to get in for appointment, great amenities with salt cavesaunahot tub, manicurist was friendlycons: my gel nails started chipping within 5 days when it normally should last at least 714, woman at front desk was a little rude, limited gel selection
its great they open so early 7a.m. thinking i can just walk in was not a great idea. they booked last but were still able to take me in. my service with tabitha was awesome but my mani started chipping the next morning less than 24 hrs later.  i got the nailpolish that is supposed to last longer not dry faster.
i was really excited to try this restaurant which used to be paris beurre but its been remodeled, changed name. the place looks great. very modern. i went for a lunch on a thursday so i have ordered from the daily menu which included tea, soup or salad and main course. i took the salad which was a couscous salad and that was very good. tea was good too. entree was beef something, like a steak but it was ok but nothing that blows your mind. we paid the little extra to have the ``dessert du jour`` which was bread pudding with an interresting toping, the flavor was interesting in a good way, different, but the bread part was really dry like didnt feel fresh. it was a ``pain perdu`` so i guess it was supposed to have that kind of dry texture but for me it was disappointing.service was really just ok, kind of slow for a lunch. we ate on the terrasse which still have that paris beurre feeling, it would be nice if it wasnt so tiny. tables are all so closed from one another that you cant use the bathroom without bumping into the other table. it seems to be more spacious inside.overall:good french restaurantok food, might depends what you order...ok service.cute terrasse.a little overpriced but its french...
so heres a little update. i wish i could say just good things about this place because the staff is so nice and pleasant but this place badly need a manager. it is so disorganized, they lost our reservation then found it then were confused about it. we asked for a bigger table on the terrase which made the terrase experience much more plaisant btw they said no, we sat at small table, they changed their mind so we moved to the big table. they forgot us a long time, then they forgot our food. food was cold. loooong super long wait for the food, not very many people . very slow service, they served an iced tea instead of a tea. forgot our desserts. up graded our lunch dessert to evening dessert choice to save the day, and that creme brulee was amazing,theres definitely a room to train and organized this place
the food is ok, and the price value is pretty good, but i found the service a little slow, especially since we were a small group. i wish there were more vegetables in the main course, but they are usually found on the side dishes. unfortunately, the side dishes were brought out first and by the time we received the main course, we had already finished our side dishes. overall, this is a nice casual place to catch up with friends. we were seated inside, but the terrace outside looked really nice.
slow as a turtle....  dont know what more you want me to say.   bring back the undocumented workers.
pros:  what they cleaned, they did very well.  interior was well wiped and treated.  the military discount dropped the price a couple of dollars!  cons: very slow.  didnt vacuum everything.  didnt use the requested or any scent, as far as three of us could tell.  for the 19 wash it took 45 min during non peak hours with only 23 cars ahead of us.  most of the van was well cleaned but they missed vacuuming the entire rear storage area by the lift door, even though they had the door open for wiping the interior.  to be fair, i probably could have asked them to re vacuum, but i didnt inspect it while i was there.
nice theaters with stadium seating. the theaters are spacious with great surround sound. this place is decorated very upscale, it definitely fits in with the red rock casino motif. its average on pricing for movies and the snack bar. a plus is the ticket kiosk to bypass waiting in line for tickets. a nice choice for when its very busy.
i do like this theater. the reason i gave it three stars its for two main reasons. no reserve seating and only one restroom at the beginning of the theater. this is my go to theater on wednesdays because i can see a movie  for 4 as a senior and rewards member of the casino.  however, i know theater food  prices can be high but i think this theater is a little above that. otherwise its a really nice theater. ps. i dont mind if they search my purse but i dont really think it makes us any safer. i dont know any theater shootings done by a woman or a man with a woman so i think its rather pointless.
it is a solid bar which is obviously still trying to find its feet. the look is dark and that is because that is the black wolf brewerys style. bond 9 the bar before them had a similar theme. it appeals to me as this will work very well in the obviously more darker months scotlands has. i was there yesterday and i sat outside, their setting will catch the sun the whole time it is out. great way to spend a rare afternoon of sunshine. just like myself, the bar staff seems to struggle with the beers on offer. i asked for a white beer, but he didnt seem to know. i explained: something like hoegaarden, or paulaner weiss  the manageress then pointed to a vendetti blonde. .. errm.. ok. that would be a blonde. but as i obviously struggled to get the right one i settled for that. paid £4 which is not too bad. my wife wanted a rose wine. they have only 1 rose and she likes it. nope. they ran out of the only rose they have on offer. shame. order more next time. we had a snack. we decided on cheesy fries with pulled pork in bbq sauce. really nice! string fries and very succulent pork. recommended.
good outside space is a plus. they have a great cocktail menu and some really great spirits. what lets them down is their beer selection. nothing craft or interesting of note. they have atlantic pale dna which is brewed on licence from dogfishhead in the uk and is reasonable  but ive had a better pint of that elsewhere. a friend bought a pint of meantime pale ale here and it was literally undrinkable. he had to go home it made him feel so ill. hardly a good impression.good for events although the wee conservatory gets warm. very warm. a lovely outdoor space if its nice weather though. slammin
its too bad our experience here was not what we expected it to be. the esablishment was nice and clean but the therapist my wife had lacked customer service skills and was rude the whole time. the manager was kind enough to give us a refund for my wifes massage and aplogized for her staff. im sure like any other place, its a hit or miss.
my first time coming to chronic tacos was during my lunch break. the line was to the door. it was about a 40min wait for me. i was getting a little frustrated cause i was taking a step every 10mins. i finally place an order and my burrito was alright. my carnitas that i had were dry. was not a good experience for my first time here.
ok...been waiting for awhile for this place to open up..came in tonight a friday  wasnt too busy, but there was several people in line. staff seemed rushed and hurried, ordered a carnitas taco and potato taco, boyfriend ordered fish and shrimp tacos.  by the time his was done my 2 were stone cold...he said his were really good. so food was  good, girl at cash register didnt know how to pour the beer, thankfully some one else came along and did it, and we had to ask 2 times for our chips and salsa, which the salsa was not really salsa...so the staff..is so so...i hope it was just opening jitters and i will come back in a few months to try again..hopefully this place will work out the little kinks they had tonight.
ive been waiting with bated breath to see which restaurant would occupy the final spot in the shopping center by my house. when chronic tacos was announced, i was excited at the prospect of an alternative to chipotle. unfortunately, in the vein of smashburger, chronic tacos expects you to pay a premium for subpar food. i cant begin to count the ways paying 9 for a california burrito is wrong, but soggy fries is definitely one of them.customer service is also lacking. this place has only been open for two weeks, but the workers expect everyone who walks through the door to be a veteran. i repeatedly had to ask the server to describe what my options were. no, i dont know that the white cheese is called oaxaca. i also had no idea that brown rice wasnt available. the ordering system is strange. too. instead of bringing all the ingredients for menu items to the front of the store, some have to be cooked to order in the back. the result is that you have to step out of line to wait for an item to be cooked to order, then back in when it comes time to tell the food worker which toppings you want.while i will readily admit that the chronic fries are delicious  and appropriately priced  i do not feel, having eaten an entire california burrito, that the price was on point. chipotle does the same thing for almost 3 less, though with fewer topping options.in the end, i feel like chronic tacoss entire business model revolves around asking customers to pay more to avoid dealing with mexicans. but if i want good mexican food, those are exactly the people i want making it! there are also a dearth of cheaper mexican food options in the area. i will try any restaurant once, but i wont be back here. i can get a california for 4 less right down the street.
food is excellent.  team needs a manager, and some more timeexperience under their belt.  very slow and disorganized and chaotic in the assembly line.  great atmosphere, great prices, great food.
the carne asada is so good we deal with the shit show of employees stumbling over eachother to get it at least once a week. the place def needs a suggestion box, menu is confusing, again employees are just funny how all over the place they are, the manager, haha we laugh at her every time because shes always storming around not helping. good thing the food is so bomb, also careful if youre on your lunch, 2 taco stations one register never seems to pan out in our favor .
food handling by the employees appears to be acceptable now. the dude with the giant ass beard is now wearing a beardnet  i dont see employees eating on the line or keeping their drinks in view of customers anymore. the wait times still suck. usually theres only 2 people on the food line, including the cashier. there should be more food assembly line workers, especially during lunch rush hour.
the food was great and what i expected from ct. fresh tasting, solid seasoning, good portion sizes. the only thing that kept this review from being  was the wait time and employees attitude. ive worked in restaurants and i understand that when things get chaotic its hard to maintain a good flow but from the beginning of our order to when we got our food was 30 minutes. thats 30 minutes of standing in line while the employees were grumbling and angry. one lady was just slamming trays around and kept talking crap about the bearded guy. like seriously? i dont want to hear that. bearded guy was actually really nice and was the only employee to make the experience better. fake it til you make it, ct. put a smile on and itll help with the wait time.
of course the inside was brand new and very nice. decorations nice, furniture nice and new. the only thing that i was truly disappointed in was the cleanliness of the tables. almost every table i wanted to sit at was dirty with lettuce all over it from a previous meal. with 7 associates in this small location and it being a new location you would think that they would make it a priority to keep their tables clean. the speed of service is also something i was disappointed in. they did not seem very busy during my visit, but i seem to have waited 10 minutes for my two subs. half of the staff was friendly with smiling faces while the other half seemed as if they wanted us to get out of their hair. this is my first visit to the maricopa location and i understand that it is a new location and kinks need to be worked out. i will visit this location again and hope to receive better service.
my first two visits they took forever, i had tried to call in my first order but, no number available anywhere. second time, used number on the first receipt, which was wrong. the sandwiches were the tastiest in maricopa. the staff at this location is sooo incompetent i would not be out of line staying many of these people rode the short bus.my third was improved, the big kahuna  the 13 were better than subway or firehouse here in copa. the staff still are subpar, but i think its just very poor management, since the guy who looked to be in charge said he was from another store and did not give a crap, at all! if they could get it together, they could kill it here. if not, their weird location will be their undoing.lost 2 stars for crap serviceupdate: the sandwiches are still good...the service is getting better
i gave the 3 star review because they are new and i will try them again, but i would have rated it lower if they were not a new location just starting. the ruben i ordered had little to no meat on it and it looked like i was just eating a small loaf of bread. my kids ordered the chicken bacon ranch. when they were asked what they wanted on it they said just lettuce. lol when we got the sandwich it was chicken and lettuce no ranch or bacon. but it did have cheese. when we went back up to the counter they said thats the way we ordered it. instead of just saying ok we can fix that, they were like its your fault u said just lettuce. ok its our fault! now fix it. so in a month or 2 we will try it again but for now. we wont be back soon.
i saw this open and thought, thats what we need in maricopa another sandwich or pizza shop, but getting sick of subway and the wait at firehouse is too long. not a bad sandwich, you can tell the employees are new, they kind of stumbled through making the sandwich. fresh bread and veggies, meat was a little stingy. i will wait a couple weeks and try again, give them time to get comfortable with what they are doing.
bread was good and the place was clean.
its a good bar with friendly staff. the food is not authentic mexican. if you want to have a drink with happy people youre in the right place. if you want a really great plate of carne asada or street tacos it is best to go elsewhere.
went here with friends tonight after trying to find it in google search. i found 3 addresses. very  confusing. it is located at 3515 w northern if you want the correct address. the food was yummy and hot! not luke warm like many other places, but oven hot. love it! had the cheese enchiladas and the mini chimi appatizer, both wonderful. great place, delish food. will be back now that i can find it
my wife and i were very excited when we drove by and saw a new mexico food restaurant had open less than a mile from where we live. my wife and i met and married in new mexico. she had lived there 24 years and i lived there for 8. we both adore and missed authentic new mexican food which differs in taste than traditional mexican food. the new mexican cuisine focuses it taste experience on hatch chiles from hatch new mexico. the hatch chile is not hot per se but has a very smooth and flavorful bite that is somewhat unique tasting.  we came sort of late in the evening and 30 minutes before closing. the decor was outstanding the staff was friendly and courteous and the management was genuinely accommodating and gracious.  since it was late we decided to take out instead of eat in. the homemade chips and salsa were delicious ! the menu was very expansive so it took us a while to order because everything we saw looked scrumptious. we ordered multiple items from tacos, enchiladas, poppers and tamales. the one item we were both were very excited about ordering was the stuffed sopapillas.  once we got home we quickly open the food bag and laid out our feast. now comes the hard part of the review that i am trying to be as fair as possible to this new restaurant.  the food was not warm and it came as a surprise to us since we were quite literally 5 minutes from receiving the food and traveling home. the tamales were dry and the coupe de grai was the hugely disappointing stuffed sopapillas.   my wife and i have had several varieties of stuffed sopapillas from sante fe to las cruces and everywhere in between and all had one thing in common. they all were stuffed from the inside of the sopapillas. chile addition had their  spin and had a smothered sopapilla. both my wife and i could of got passed that except the finish product was visually unappealing and the taste and texture was disappointing.  with any other restaurant i have tried in the past i would of signed them off as a failure and move on to another new restaurant to try. because of the afore mentioned wonderful staff, friendly and gracious management and the well appointed decor i am going to step out of my comfort zone and retry chile addiction and come in at a earlier time and eat in.   hopefully the meal of june 3rd their second day opened was a fluke and the food will match on what we considered an enchanting atmosphere.
little bit of a mixed opinion here.... since wife is involved in substance abuse treatment she didnt find whole addiction theme too humorous. nevertheless i should say food is pretty good. there is not much new mexico style restaurants in town to begin with so i am somewhat short on comparison. id like to try some more dishes here to come to more educated conclusion. for now rate 3.75salsa was darn spicy and fresh sopapillas are good. good effort on decoration and interior... really liked it.
family owned with colorful and thoughtful decor and thats just when you first walk in the door! service, even for a simple takeout order, was friendly, made menu suggestions, and even tossed in some extra sopapillas. menu has all of your southwestern favorites, with both red and green chile.the green chili stew was thick and wellspiced, packed with potatoes but only a few bits of pork. good flavor in this dish, and a good price, which included accompanying tortillas. i also added on a chile relleno with both red and green sauce from their a la carte section, but found it soggy and overbattered. the sauces were on point, though. bring your hankie, because your eyes will be tearing up at the heat.however, im not a fan of the gimmicky drug420 references all over the menu referring to a breakfast burrito as a blunt, for example? i find it tacky and in poor taste, unless your target audience is high school teenagers. bonus points for offering a yelp checkin offer for free dessert with purchase.
this is a review of great and really pretty poor.  went to chile addiction on sunday.  it was about 3:00 and the place had about 4 tables.  we were seated immediately.  once we reviewed the menu, we ordered a bowl of soup to split between the 2 of us and an entree each.  the chips and salsa arrived pretty quickly.  the chips are christmas red  green and nothing to write home about.  the salsa, however was complex and had enough heat to wake you up, but not so much as to make you want to run away. we waited about 15 minutes before asking our server if we were getting our soup.  he said he would check and out he came with our soup and the two entrees all at the same time.  we were told that they thought the order was for 3 people even though there were only two of us at the table.  i had to ask for spoons!!!  the soup was very good.the pork chili verde was quite nice as an entree.  complex chili flavors and a fair portion. i am not sure of the idea of every entree coming with sopapillas and having honey on the table.  they were ok, but ensured that we did not need to order desert.as i said from the start. this is a review of great  the food and the pretty poor  the service.  if you can get over the fact that it may take your server 3 trips to bring 2 glasses of water and straws for quality tasty food at a fair price, then this place is for you.  the owner was there,but she was either running the register or setting tables.  she did stop by our table due to the challenge with the food, but did not stop at any others.
im from silver city, nm. this is the food of my childhood. from birthdays to funerals, and everywhere in between, this food is engrained in a very special part of my life. so, my review may be biased....i understand this restaurant is just over a month old, so small things like slow wait staff the place being a little unorganized from top to bottom really didnt bother me too much. the food, was...ok. i ordered the hangover smothered burrito which was far from being smothered in green chilies and my fiance ordered the huevos rancheros. neither of us ate the hashbrowns because they were so unbelievably covered in butter they were almost inedible. both dishes featured the green chile as they should, but just fell short with the sides. of course the hashbrowns, and the refried beans were over cooked and chewy. our waiter brought us sopapillas on the house because of the long wait, which was very nice of him, but could not heal the wounds of not being able to taste the once forgotten green chile.we will be back to try dinner, but breakfast just wasnt happening.
friendly and fast service. i ordered the hard shelled tacos a la carte and those were really good but there was nothing chile relleno about the chile relleno i ordered. it looked like it had been deep fried a hundred times. the cheese was liquidy and the batter was not cooked all the way through even though they deep fried it. i would still go and try something else though. nice place and great service. no beer or wine though :
this is one of the newest additions in the south west. chile addiction is a new mexico restaurant with an emphasis on green and red chile. i ordered the sopaipilla with adovada. the meat was nicely cooked with a very good flavor. the chile tends to be a bit spicy. the dish comes with two sides. i picked the calabacitas and the spanish rice. both sides were pretty disappointing, they were plain and lacked flavor. i had the chance to try the tostada compuesta which is pretty much a taco salad. the were some good parts of the dish and some others that were just average. although the customer service was very good the food took a while to be delivered. unfortunately, i dont think i would come back.
new mexico cuisine is world class.  if you havent been to albuquerque and eaten stacked enchiladas youre missing a truly awesome culinary experience.  chile addiction is the best new mexico cuisine in las vegas sorry carlitos.  that being said, the chile could use some tweaking.  the red has good chile flavor but it could use some mexican oregano, cumino and a little more salt.  it may be worthwhile to upgrade from bueno too.  no big complaints with the green and, in fact, the pork verde is very good.  the pinto beans also suffer from a lack of seasoning.  i like a few cloves of garlic thrown in while they are cooking and finished with lard and plenty of salt.  sopapillas are very good.  cant wait til they get some beer in there.  service can be a little scatterbrained but it just adds to the authenticity.
my husband and i are looking for a restaurant that serves very spicy mexican food... thought this would be it but it wasnt. the food was good. it did remind me of new mexico mexican food. they had sopapillas which ive never been able to find in vegas. tamales were good. but the sopapillas alone is what ill be going back for. just wish the chili was really spicy like it is in nm. and yes, i did try the xxx chili... weak!
the place is very nice inside but the food lacked flavor !! carlitos food is much tastier!! the green chili was good but everything lacked seasoning!! was kind of disappointed! will try something new next time ! we had the chile rellenos  .
was feeling mexicanish food and my wife found this new place. i have to say i dont have a taste for new mexican cuisine. service and food were good but just not good enough.
ok...being from mexican decent this is hard to give review...never been to new mexico so i have to say the chile verde compared to real mexican chile verde...this chile verde falls flat...its ok but i had to salt it....the asada tacos were meh...the hero of this place is the sopapillas.the service was good
this has been on my radar for a few weeks and we went here for dinner tonight.  walking into the restaurant is a treat.  it is so well decorated with new mexican, southwestern and chile items that its very pleasant.we were soon greeted by amy who showed us to our table and was our server.  after looking over the menu, we ordered a burrito for my wife with refried beans and spanish rice and i got a chimichanga filled with carne adovada.  my two sides were pinto beans and calabacitas.  i ordered red sauceregular spice levelfor my wife and i got the triple hot green sauce for my chimichanga.  we were brought a basket of chips and some salsa that had a good kick to it.  even my gringa wife is starting to like spicier foods.  win!our dinners came and they were very good.  andrea thought her red sauce was spicy but she liked it.  my triple hot green sauce was great and it added great flavor to the adovada.  the only minor drawback was we were brought no sopapillas despite the menu saying that all meals are served with sopapillas and two sides.  as it turned out, we were full enough without having the extra amount of food from the sopapillas.for dessert, we got an order of fried ice cream with chocolate drizzle.  very good and large enough for sharing.prices are very reasonable and for some reason we had a 4.35 credit applied to our bill listed as a coupon.  we didnt have a coupon.  our server, amy, was a verry pleasant person.  she made you feel welcome.i wish the menu offered a bit more choices but i will be back to try the stacked enchiladas.
i wish i would have read andreas review before coming to chile addiction.we had the chicken nachos and the chile rellenos with both green and red chile. to sum the food up in one word: bland. seriously, i didnt know a chile stuffed with cheese and covered in chile could be bland, but it was. calabicitas: bland. nachos: chips with plain chicken breast on top and a small amount of cheese sauce on the bottom which somehow also lacked flavor. they dont even offer some table salsa to spice things up on your own. sopapillas come with your meal, which is a nice touch and why they got the 3rd star. however, we had 2 adults and 2 kids, so we split 2 entrees, and were served 2 sopapillas. how much would it cost to provide 4 sopapillas for 4 people???service was a little slow, but overall ok.mostly, im just disappointed that i used up one of my valuable bookmark trips on chile addiction.
service was great! like, super great! im mexican but from like socal and i judge my places on their beans. and this place, not so much. my recommendation, order anything else just not the beans, theyre like canned beans or they were just super dry. very meh! but everything else was super yums!
nous avons goute ce foodtruck pour le mondiale de la biere.nayant pas eu envie de prendre une des poutines nous avons choisis le sandwich au porc effiloche. je lai trouve tres bon avec sa salade de choux mais par contre je nai vraiment pas accroche sur les frites. je ne les ai pas aime ... dommage mais heureusement que le sandwich etait bon !
beau festival! bons ribs, bonne ambiance. je nai pas ete decue. en esperant que lexperience se repete lan prochain!
premiere visite aujourdhui. le resto est joli, belle deco . la soupe excellente. nous avons tous ete, decu de lattitude hautaine de la serveuse. on doit se referer a un menu papier pour comprendre les combinaisons possibles sur un  e selection , ecrite sur une ardoise. nous avons eu besoin dexplications supplementaires, pour faire notre choix. notre jeune et jolie serveuse, a peutetre trouve nos questions stupides, quelle a enleve le menu de mes mains.elle etait incapable de mexpliquer la quantite dune petite soupe. jai vu , par la suite, le format gradue des bols. elle ne le savait peutetre pas...le cafe est excellent, mais surtout il ne faut demander des explications, parce que la ,la jeune et jolie serveuse, risque de vous cataloguer dans la liste des morons de la journee.bref, jai aime la nourriture, mais je me suis sentie jugee avec mepris par la jeune et jolie serveuse.
it is located behind office building on sunset rd. there is outdoor seating, dining, bar with table games, a small stage for live music. it was clean, with a nice atmosphere vibe. we came here last night for the rock and roll wine tastings. they had some specials for that night only. we had the pizza and it was not that good. i dont remember but it might be a hawaiian pizza, had pineapple on it. the bartenders were friendly and offered some tastings of their new drinks to try. we couldnt finish the pizza but left them a good tips.
i wish the office was back.  ok for starters the staff dont know table numbers, how to be attentive to a table, and most of all the menu!!!  how do you not know the menu?  the floor is slippery and your chair is like drunk girl at a frat house.  food was nothing special wouldnt go just to eat again for a joint with burgers in the name i felt a sense of shame for them, like the bar setup though...  a on that and they have two hearted which arguably is one of the best beers out there.
ive been here twice, and both times the food was great and the service... not so much.the first time i came here was during happy hour they have great happy hour deals, and i sat at the bar. i waited and twiddled my thumbs for a few minutes until my neighbor gave me his menu. he then started making recommendations. this gentleman should have been working there. he did a much better job than any of the three bartenders there. when i finally was able to get a bartenders attention, after being in the bar for ten minutes, i ordered a beer and an appetizer. my beer came quickly, and as should have been expected, it was the wrong beer. i tried to flag down the bartender, but that was not fruitful, so i drank it anyway. it was not very good an oatmeal stout when i ordered a hefeweizen. following this mistake, my food took an exceedingly long time to come out, and having not seen the bartender in quite some time, i asked a waitress, and she informed me that there was no order in. she did this in a very quick manner which was great, even though the report was less than desirable. i told her that i did not want to order anything else, and that i was just going to finish my beer and leave. she got the manager without my request, and he apologized and paid for me to get a replacement appetizer. the food was excellent, and half of the staff were excellent.the second time i came here, i sat at a table. it took me 5 minutesthree passes of the waitress at our dirty table before i had to raise my voice to get her attention. she apologized and came back with a towel and to take our orders. the service was very slow and the food was very good. i did not see any of the same people behind the bar as last time, and i recognized one of the new bartenders from mill ave. this raised my hopes for their future success, because he was a great bartender there. they still havent worked out their growing pains in the front yet, but their kitchen has yet to disappoint.
i wish i could give this place more stars as a go to burger joint is much needed in the area. the ambiance here is awesome, lots of tvs and seating. the downside is that the burgers are not amazing. generally too big and messy to enjoy. also have tried the chicken sandwich and sadly the same thing is true. the one thing i do love is the french fries. ill have to come back to try the salads. wish they could follow hop doddys burger style...
my husband and i tried the shea location for the first time today.  one of our friends didnt like it bad service, soso food so we put off trying it.  then a couple of friends said they loved it so we figured wed try. first off, the service was great. alicia was very nice, explained the menu, overall a great server.apparently wednesday is build your own burger for 11.  you can have as many toppings as you want.  im not a fan of lots of stuff on my burger so it was wasted on me but went for it. a fairly plain burger off the menu still ends up being close to if not 10.   i did add avocado since i could if it hadnt been wed it would have been 1 and it was maybe 14th of an avocado. the amount of mushrooms 1 was barely adequate. for 12 per i want full portions of toppings. the burger does include very good chips or fries.   there are other options for 13 more. 10 is a bit steep for a plain burger to me especially since it was quite mediocre.  its plenty of burger, but just meh.  neither of us added a sauce to our burgers and although the beef was not dry, it came off dry because the top of the buns  1 reg, 1 pretzel were so big. our wonderful server asked us if we liked it and would be back. i honestly told her no, but not because of her.   just not worth the price. god bless her she told us about happy hour.  7.50 burger, onion dip, good drink prices.  much more appropriate for our style.we will go back for happy hour thanks to alicia but if we want a big, juicy 9 burger well stick to tavern grill down the road.  and theyre 12 price saturdays!
the food wasnt bad, but it isnt a place to take a family. my sons and i 3 of us have been here several times, but the prices are too steep for a family. each time it was at least a 65 bill for lunch! thats my only real complaint. not like we were ordering drinks and deserts, we werent. the sliders are great, big points on those. the burgers were a bit greasy, but what can one expect...i think the chef ought to try umami burgers in l.a. fries were fine. too noisy though.  but it is s sports bar. i think the open bay concept simply help amplify the noise.
nous avons goute a leur brunch durant leur debut.malheureusement, nous avons eu beaucoup dattente pour le service des plats.les assiettes etaient bien pleines.mais le service beaucoup trop long environ 2h30 pour un brunch dune table de 6 personnes.
everything was great but a girl that massage me didnt understand english at all. i try to tell her that my neck and shoulder are pain. she said ok ok but she didnt touch my neck at all. till the end of the massage , i told her to massage my neck she said sorry sorry. i think she thought i was complaining that she did it too hard. so i didnt get my neck and my shoulder massage. other than that its good. she massage my back , feet, and leg very good. room is clean. and very quiet. if u want to get massage here , make sure tell the guy in the front to explain your masseur what do u need her to pay more attention to. and u will have a great time.
very good service, nice people. nice latte. very bad guac and chips. no air conditioning.
ive walked by this spot probably hundreds of times and never thought to walk in. after hearing that it was under new management we decided to give it a shot for brunch. i loves me a nearby place for brunchin.allinall, i cant say i was disappointed probably because i didnt really have any expectations. the space is extremely cute; the service was good; the portions were generous; but manohman was the food underseasoned. i doctored my huevos rancheros with a ton of salt and sriracha and it still remained a nice plating job although i have to say i enjoyed that the corn tortillas were fried. my partner had the same deal with his herbivore plate. the stinker here is that a few blocks away is cafe joes arguably the cuter breakfast cafe, with lower prices and seasoned fare.at the end of the day, if i were to head back i think it would just be for a coffee and baked goods.
they say they open till 4pm but they are currently closed and its 3 and may actually possibly be in transition switching businesses...
got the pollo asado quesadilla, grilled fish taco, bean and cheese burrito. 7.20 for a quesadilla seems high. it was good but that felt a little high. only got one salsa though. and salsa was very mild and watery. the fish taco was ok. needed more flavor. the sauce on it was good. the bean and cheese burrito was huge lots of sheeees. but beans need salt. overall gave it a 3 star rating because its new, clean and everyone was nice to us and food came out quick. standing room only when we went on a saturday afternoon. better flavor than the other places in cg filiburts, vakerrr  nicos still better imo..
well, after all of the buzz, we finally tried it out. the place was jumping. all the tables were full and several people in line. luckily we got a table. the place is indeed clean and the service friendly and fairly quick. i had the carne asada burrito. it was just ok. the meat was nicely seasoned but it was super small and the meat a little tough and for 6, not a bargain at all. for less money i can get a local carne asada burro that is probably twice as big and better tasting in my opinion. the mrs. had a bean and cheese burro and said it was good but again, pretty small. the chips and salsa are fine but not anything special. might try it again for something else but all in all not super excited.
i was very disappointed in the buffet. this italian restaurant did not have pasta in the buffet. the hostess seating everyone was saying there was soup and salad in the buffet but there was no soup.  the service was good.  price is high for what they had. better off ordering from the menu
was here this morning for breakfast! its a bit pricey. after tip, my meal came out to be over 18 and all i had was a water and two eggs over corned beef hash. i was slightly disappointed; the dish came out room temperature and the poached eggs werent even close to runny. my brother and mother, however, got the 16.99 bagel and lox platter and werent disappointed. although a bit too much in price, you did get a fair amount of salmon. id try them again if the prices were lower. as of now, nah.
food was better than expected and our server d was super. not one complaint about the service as d was efficient, friendly and overall excellent. would definitely come back just for being treated like a customer which is more than i can say about other places in vegas.
to be a successful indian restaurant in the oakland area, rather than just another indian restaurant is quite tough. i think bombay curry house has a lot of disadvantages as a newcomer. one, there are a lot of other more well established indian restaurants within the 1mile radius. two, bombay curry house is located much deeper in south oakland, away from the hustling and bustling main campus. three, theyre a tad pricier than the other places and their portion size isnt as satisfying. four, they did not do a good job with advertising. i only know about it because i walk by here daily. the food was just average. there was nothing that really stood out to me. i had the chance to try the chicken kadai and chicken madras. the chicken kadai barely had any chicken in it, mostly onions and green peppers. the flavors were a bit too smoky. the chicken madras was drenched in a coconut curry sauce, on the sweeter side. again, the portion was small for the price. they did offer unlimited white rice though. my dining experience here was unmemorable. there was nothing to really draw me back. they need to either advertise their specials or vamp up their food a bit in order to lure in the customers. i came here during opening week and it was dreadfully empty. they do have lunch buffet hours, but didnt make it for that. hopefully other fellow yelpers can shed some light onto that
the food is pretty good at this place, but my frustration is with the service, specifically the drivethru. twice recently ive ordered sandwiches and specifically asked for no onion and theyve still put onion on the sandwich. also, today, i ordered a pastry, which they just put in the large bag as a loose item without any other packaging around it, so the icing smeared all over the other items in the bag. its just poor customer service which diminishes the fresh, tasty food products they produce.
the food was very good. i will definitely go through the drive thru next time. the entire time i sat in the dining room no one came out and cleaned the tables as people left. i had to sit at a table that hadnt been wiped down. there were 3 or 4 staff members but they all stayed behind the counter and it was not busy. also, constant beeping! i work in a restaurant, i know what a timer sounds like. im pretty sure it means youre supposed to check on something or take it out of the oven not just let it beep forever and ignore it.
first time at kneader and eat here on a tuesday morning with not to many people there. the restaurant is where you order at the counter and then they bring the food to you. was not expecting that initially but kind if liked the setup. the restaurant is kind of like a store, bakery and restaurant.  tried the endless french toast and ham and egg breakfast sandwich croissant. the endless french toast is prepared on texas size toast so you really cant eat too many slices. the french toast itself is pretty good but did not knock my socks off.the ham and egg sandwich on the croissant was actually pretty good but almost seem a little sparse.overall not too bad if you are not looking for a nice sit down breakfast place but want something more on the quick side.
i was excited to have a drive thru that had seemingly healthy options. picked up lunch just now and im disappointed my kids lunch was missing the side and my sandwich as did my husbands lacked any sort of taste. we actually threw out the other half of our sandwiches opting not to waste our calories. maybe we will try breakfast but no more lunch for us again.
im not sure about how to review this place. the set up is great, clean and friendly. all the selections look delicious and everything i have tried has been good one big thing, every time we eat here both myself, my daughter as well as some friends end up with stomach problems. we arent sure if its the flour or leavening agent they use. we keep trying though because everything tastes great.
not much to review here yet, but i did come here for an egg sandwich, only to learn they use fried eggs in their sandwiches. you could get scrambled, but the counter guy didnt seem to convinced to go that route. i ended up with an almond croissant that was a bit unusual with icing on top and was in the mid range of this pastry category. also strange was that they were sampling a great item the blueberry muffin top but when i wanted to buy it, they were sold out. dont bother sampling something if its not available. thanks.
i finally got a chance to try this place. i almost always order pho dac biet special pho where ever i go and unfortunately this place didnt really do it for me. the restaurant was very clean as i would expect a brand new place to be and servers were attentive. in the area i think little saigon has the best pho dac biet, their pho tai is not anything to write home about but the dac biet is awesome!!!  my boyfriend ordered the bún tht nng and he said it was much better then little saigons.
i asked what the special of the day was and the waitress shrieked with her face and said i wouldnt recommend it. at that point i was thinking, omgeeee should i leave? i like to push the note, so i asked her what is it? and in my head i was prepared for her to tell me local cat meow! however, what she described was in the same ballpark.... something with pork blood. it is dacbietbun rieu. ooook, were taking it back to the old country here. our meals were ok, but nothing to write home about. pho is one of my favorite foods and i would say this one was middle of the road with seasoning but there was a hearty portion of tripe tendon, medium rare beef and meatball.  it was a little awkward that other than my family, there was 1 other couple in the restaurant dining.
i went to phoenix pho and it was a spacious restaurant compared to previous pho places ive been to. it was a clean place and the water tasted like water not tap. we ordered the eggrolls. my sis absolutely loves the eggrolls, she claims theyre the best. i ordered the spicy beef noodle stew. the beef broth stew tasted really good but i hated the udon noodles they used. i was surprised when i saw it. other than that, i enjoyed this place.
the food here is good but not great. i wouldnt order the rice dishes because the taste is kind of unique. its just not compatible with me.
the food was really good but the service sucked both times we went there. the last visit there was what really rubbed me the wrong way. we spent 45 minutes waiting for our food an order of the tres tacos and a quesadilla... not much and our server came by only once in the 45 minutes to check up on us. once we finished our food we waited about another 30 minutes for the check in which it took another server to come by our table and ask if we needed anything because she probably noticed how upset we were. we told her we were ready for the check and said we didnt know where our server went. she then said our server had gone on her break and our server never informed us of this. i did not get the chance to get our servers name but she was a brunette covered in tattoos.overall the food is awesome but because of the service i have to give it 3 stars.
had the nachos grande and it was huge. however, some chips were stale and meat was kinda cold this was after midnight. the waitresses were nice. overall, the place is okay.
generic mexican place. food was fine. my margarita wasnt very strong. shrimp fajitas were good and came with elote! that was a nice change. overall wasnt anything special. small room. service was slow. there were empty tables everywhere but still had to wait 10 minutes to get seated.
i visited las vegas last days.i decided to go to this restaurant.i waited 15 minutes,before server bring us menu.5 star that its work 24hours1 star for guacamoleits just avocado and nothing more,no lime,a little cilantro,no salt!no taste!! i was so disappointed 1star for salad, chicken was cold.also they charging for chips and salsa!
i had the mahi mahi tacos lunch special. the fish was way too salty. since i was there for a work lunch, i didnt send them back. good thing the waitress kept refilling my drink
i ended up at tequila taqueria while attending an event in ballys.  we were meeting up with a couple of friends for dinner and they had a hankering for texmex.  tequila taqueria was conveniently located near the ballroomconvention area.  theyre right next to buca, and seem to share some facilities  one of the glasses we got actually had the buca logo on it.unfortunately, the location was one of the only things going for it.  the food was underwhelming.  nachos came out in a small mountain and looked pretty cool, but were pretty average.  the chicken tacos were pretty dry and didnt have any accompaniments, though the seasoning on them was nice.service wasnt the best.  it wasnt crowded at all, but our waitress seemed to disappear after taking our orders and was missing for long periods of time.  adequate if you really need some texmex, but there are probably better options around.
jamie and jenny did good job.
aok would sum up my feelings on the newly opened huckleberry park. you will find it  located on the southwest corner of farm road and egan crest way. this is phase 1 of huckleberry park in the master planned community of providence nw las vegas. it boasts green spaces to run around, swing sets, basketball courts, picnic tables, grills and a walking path. it is much smaller than knickerbocker park sister park located down the street on shaumber. my focus for coming here was to inspect the dog parks. huckleberry offers a large side for large pups and a small side for small pups. you simply choose the park that fits your dogs stature. both dog parks are stretched out compared to knickerbocker and were well thought out. my two pups enjoyed their evening romp in the grass video included. overall, this park is a welcomed addition to our community. i hope that phase 2 will include jogging trails and more shaded areas. i will bump it up if they can hook it up for runnerswalkers. dog park tip: heads up! watch where you step. unfortunately, others have been lazy and havent been picking up after the pups properly happens at dog parks everywhere. its a nice park and i enjoyed my time there. i simply hope they tidy it up a bit to ensure it wont become a dumping ground  if you catch my drift.
great park for dog owners.the dog park is large. even the small dog side is very large. we have one dog that is iffy around others, so we can go off to the side on the far end of the fenced in dog park and usually we are fine.just wish they had better lighting around the dog park area. once it gets dark you cant see anything and you could step in dog shit that someone didnt pick up.
eh its a 2 star park, but since its close it gets 1 more star.  sad that the contractor took so long in this park! hopefully phase 2 is way better!!!!!! kids playground, splash pad, bocce ball, tennis, skatepark, or something will make this better!?
the truckload of food that takashi pushes out for his 40 twelve course dinners make restaurant week look like restaurant weak.  seriously... you would need to attach a garbage disposal to your stomach to make it through this bad boy.  maybe if my car broke down up on mount charleston and i walked all the way here would it be possible?  so while value, ambition, friendly service, and remarkable design upgrades cannot be denied, my fault is with the execution and general flow of the menu.  even for myself, i find it hard to believe i am complaining about too much food, but i am going there.   as an example, course plate 48 could easily go chicken teriyaki, huge sushi roll, 6 oysters, karaage fried chicken and then beef sukiyaki.  thats like a mixtape going from mozart to slipknot to whitney houston to last years grammy winning polka artist.  why are oysters right in the dead center of the 12?  who goes from fried meat to sukiyaki in real life?  something like this should be harmonious from beginning to end, but i just looked at it as battles within battles.  the menu vs my stomach capacity, the food vs the evergrowing takeout bag the servers kept loading up, my waistline vs my pants, my tastebuds sanity vs holy shit, were only on 5??  a server informed us that only one person had been able to plow through it all since they opened and that he was a yelper.  nice job, yelper.  did you go to home depot or lowes for that attachment? ;if youre still going to do this, these are the battles between course choices:3: soba salad vs tofu salad vs potato salad: my wifes soba salad won.  the dressing mixed with the cold noodles and crisp greens were excellent.  you also get a choice of salad topping grilled salmon, chicken or salmon skin.  we both went with grilled salmon although perhaps the salmon skin might have come off like a luxurious crouton and been the way to go.  dont load up on potato!  trust me.  6: oysters vs snow crab: it was a tko by the oysters.   even though the crab was nicely presented on a chilled plate, it could never be a match of 6 large raw oysters on a wooden boat.  this would retail for at least 18 elsewhere.  i will be back for this the next time dining a la carte.   7: tempura vs karaage: we barely touched either of these due to fullness and what was still to come, but id go with the tempura which was a nice medley of veggies along with 2 pieces of shrimp.  even though the karaage was dry and uninspiring, it lasted better in the fridge whereas tempura should be eaten immediately and was really bad a couple of days later.  already stuffed to the gills, it was at this point that we considered asking to return tomorrow to finish the rest.  would it be ok if i just left my credit card overnight?  i saw that there was a foot spa in the same plaza.  maybe we could come back in an hour?  that moment sounded as good a time as any to take up cigarette smoking.  8: beef sukiyaki vs diced steak:  bitch, please.  not only did the steak not put up a fight, they didnt even walk into the ring.  flawless victory!  the sukiyaki was classic.  it was rich and filled with noodles, vegetables and semifatty beef which made the broth even better.  we asked for a side of raw egg to dip the beef into, and that made those 6 combined bites we took before they whisked it away in takeout boxes even better.  this could have been a standalone entree.  9: mini doria vs 4 pc baked fantasy:  they should get rid of this course altogether.  the doria is a bowl of rice topped with a mix of ground beef, tomato sauce and cream.  no one in their right mind would want this after everything else.  ditto for a gross hot sushi roll filled with cream cheese.  lose, lose.  server: anything else?me: lap band surgery.10: 4 piece nigiri vs salmon bowl more rice! vs hamburger:  nigiri won.  it was the smallest portion of food!  tony t was at another table and got the hamburger which was a full hamburger, bun and all with fries.  am i going crazy?  some may avoid this spot because their ayce is 80 per person, but with the exorbitant amount of food we walked out with, itll be more about all you cant eat.  there were 5 more individual meals with the leftovers we had!  portions should be halved, if not quartered, and everything needs to be rearranged by someone with sane eyes.   no one would complain about paying 40 for that.
the sashimi here is exceptional.  finally, a decent japanese restaurant knows how to prepared sashimi at the proper temperature.    sashimi is supposed to serve in a very cold temperature, especially in summer.   theres plenty of room for improvement.  40person for 12 courses are just way too big for one person.  the server should rethink when upselling an additional course.  my friend and i went to this restaurant, we wanted to share the 12 course menu for 39.99. the server told us, we must order one more dish sashimi plate 15.00.  we cant share without ordering this additional dish.  we did just that! whatever the green tea that was served tasted muddy and extremely bitter.  we ate the following: 25 the sashimi plate for 2. 15.00 i spat out a fish bone out of my salmon sashimi.  this is reason the rating is so low on this dish is no bone should ever been in a sashimi plate. i would have given a 4.55 with this dish if it werent for the bone25miso soup: a little thin in taste.  we can barely tasted miso.  the soup in way too thin. 55.  the oyster: its perfect!!15.  the special roll: king crab. the crab and avocado together tasted bitter after first bite. we stop finishing this plate.45. tofu salad:   it was nicely done. 55 squid ika carpaccio:  it was very well flavored.  we could barlely continue at this point.  3.55 sukiyaki: the favor is better than most places,  we were way too stuffed at this point and call it a quit.  pack the rest home.  the speed of service was 25.  the server doesnt pay any attention to the progress we were making.  the table was too over crowded.  the lack of expediting control in our case.  it came out too fast with a smallest table they can mustered. friendliness: 2.55.  0: serve food without attentiveness: zombie server or robot servers. 2.5: served with smile and quick to response. rooms for improvements. 4.5:  server with a warm heart.  genuinely courteous.  the attentiveness: 15.  we have to wave down a server when needed, it takes times to wave down someone for service on a friday night.   server should always be one step ahead to observe if the customers need anything, clearing of plates, refill drinks.  we actually have to wave them all down for this service.  sorry, the servers are not trained properly. there are a few things that tasted great here. i would consider returning and may possible update my reviews.
first off, i love krispy kreme. hardly ever pass buy one without getting some hot and fresh simple glazed ones. so i was excited to find this location on the far west side. i usually just get glazed because they come out hot, but i was with family and we got a dozen mixed. it was around noon on a friday but they were basically out of every flavor. their list of what they had available was shorter than their list of unavailable donuts. well we bought some of whatever they had left and a few glazed. but as we drove away and i opened the donut box anticipating the hot aroma from the hot and fresh ones, disappointment quickly came because the hot and fresh glazed were not hot and fresh. it was really just a waste of time stopping there.
the donuts are nothing special, and the coffee was very bland, but they provided great customer service.
to celebrate national donut day, i popped into this shop for a couple of donuts. i ordered a lemonfilled donut and an apple fritter because i celebrate fat fridays lol. to my amazement, the lemonfilled donut was lightly sweetened with just a hint of lemon flavor. the apple fritter tasted like a standard fritter should, nearly identical to what i would pick up from harris teeter. this is not a complaint, but i was expecting a richer, more homemade taste from this local shop. i do plan on visiting again to try coffee or a bagel, as this shop does also offer cakes, cupcakes, cannolis, pastries, cookies, bars, and more.
ok, after a response from the owner  reconsidered the amount of stars re rated it to 3 now.only due to the owerns response with reference to the bad service, an her great offer to correct the issue.
love first watch been going for years. like the decore and comfortable seating in this new location. bring back english muffins and orange marmalade please.oh and by the way, a fatty coffee option would be awesome.
first watch cornered this new location and their menu is yummy! first impression on a late thursday morning is assume a seat yourself. rolled silverware is left across the table, in lieu of near guest. booths not fully cleaned. egg overcooked within grilled sourdough bread. beaus eats were traditional eggs and bacon.  multigrain toast and sourdough could both be improved with a local bakery.cashier walks away before we sign off on the check... there was a thank you there somewhere.
very pricy. 3 for a single cupcake. almost 2 per macaron. however, their fruity pebbles macaron is absolutely delicious. the cookies n cream cupcake was ok.
for the price, my small philly cheesesteak was ok.  the taste was fine and the ingredients were cooked correctly, but it was very skimpy on the steak.  if id paid more, i would have given this two stars given the skimpiness.  i suspect they were trying to keep the calories reasonable in their six inch cheesesteak to attract calorie conscious consumers.  also, a placement issue  the sign with the available addons peppers, pickles, sauces, etc. was way down at the end away from the register where you order your actual sandwich. service was friendly, professional and fast.  given all of this, and considering it is a food court place, i think my 3 rating is fair.
the beer gets 5stars, thankfully my group of 4 was able to try each of the 4 beer on tap.  each beer came in small, medium, or large large was about one pint. the pale ale was our favorite, and the saison was the least favorite. prices were a little high compared to other local breweries 6pintspace is 4 stars, there was nothing really outstanding about it, just basic tables and chairs, with a couch against the wall.service was 1 star.  we went later in the night knowing how busy they have been, hoping the crowed would have cleared out.  we came in 30 minutes before close and it was fairly empty, no line at the bar. the three bartenders were more interested in cleaning and took about 10 minutes before we actually got our beer.  they then did last call, and three minutes after closing they came around to the 20ish people in the taproom and said they were closed and we had to leave.
we went today for the grand opening. there was a fair amount of seating and a good number of beers on tap. i had the mango saison and my fiance had the ipa. both were ok but not thrilling.the staff was super friendly, so well probably return when its not so packed.
this is a decent brewery in a building of businesses that have changed many times over the past few years.  the place is very clean yet at the same time feels too sterile as far as the atmosphere goes.  there is not a whole lot of character to it and that can be said for most of the beer too.  while definitely good, there is nothing here that would make it first on my list of breweries to visit in this area.  even their small batch beer was a hoppy pale ale which isnt exactly unique.  they had a couple of saissons, a couple of ipas, an oatmeal stout, and few other lighter beers to round out the mix.  again, it is not a bad place and the beer i had was good, but there is probably nothing you havent had before here except maybe the coffee blond vanilla ale.  i would suggest checking it out yourself though, especially if you like saissons.  the prices are a little odd too: 2 for 5 ounces, 4 for 10 ounces, and 6 for 17 ounces, plus tax which makes it a little higher than most other breweries around but not unreasonably so.
saturday night, near closing and its loud, but not packed. minimally decorated with an open bay door that leads to patio seating, but thats not helping the need for some sound proofing.  lots of beers to pick from and a friendly server who was willing to help, but i was trying to appeal to my beer newb friend who thinks miller lite is the answer.  bleh!  i ordered us 4 smalls, as the 5th i was interested in was only available for larger sized pours.  to be honest, i was not wowed by anything and nothing stood out as exceptional either.  i was very pleased to see this is a dog friendly spot and met a very cute 13yo poodle mix.  but that was sort of the highlight of my visit.  on to the next brewery....
pylos is a fairly new restaurant that opened maybe less than a year ago, it use to be jardinos. i go often to universe which is right next door, and everytime i get out of the car to walk into universe there is an amazing smell of grilled meat. so i keep telling myself i need to try this place. so finally i went to pylos. i give it a solid 3.5 star. its a nice place, clean and the food is pretty good, the portions are generous. i ordered the chicken souvlaki, it was good, too much seasoning for my taste but that just comes down to preference. the fries were fresh and crispy and the greek salad was good but not enough lemon juice or salt. tsaziki was really tasty and the bread was grilled and buttered. would i go back, maybe!!! there are better choices in my opinion, but its definitely not the worst place to go. all in all you wont be disappointed but you wont be wowed either.
about 15 per meal, but the portion is enough to fill any starving man from 0 to 100.its generally a good idea to order 2030min in advance, because thats the time it takes to get food out of the kitchen.i had the half chicken, with fried plantain and rice. the half chicken was rather tender and juicy, a little burnt however. the marinate was peppery and very tasty, but they use the same marinate for every dish my friend had seabass and it tasted same. the fried plantain were bland, but its a good substitute for fries. to add flavor, i ate it with their hot sauce.as for the rice, it was orangepinkish and somewhat aromatic, i dont know enough about african cuisine to tell what they added.after the meal, i asked around and people said you can get similar food at cheaper prices around stmichel.
we came on opening day today. i had a feeling that it would be crazy so i insisted with the bf that we call in a take out order. we couldnt find the number anywhere online. all we could find was the old number which goes to voicemail. this was probably my biggest frustration. i felt that a business absolutely needs a publicized phone number in order to be successful. so we decided to go in and order take out. when we got there, i saw a huge line for the cash register with a bunch of employees  standing around in the back. after a good 20 minutes of waiting in line, the food took just a couple of minutes to come out. it seemed like they have a lot of kinks to work out. the cashier looked like she had never used a register before. in the end, the pulled pork was delicious and ridiculously juicy. the sides kind of tasted like something theyd serve at a grocery store deli counter. the mac and cheese noodles were over cooked and flavorless. the baked beans just tasted like the sugary stuff they sell in cans. ill definitely wait to see how they figure things out before coming back.
i want to support this place...i do.  i had ribtips with cranberry coleslaw and cornbread.  why i would go back:  great service!!!, great coleslaw!!, great bbq sauce. why i wouldnt go back: the meat was fatty and tough...if the owner is reading this, i would really suggest marinating the meat for hours on end it really makes a difference!. the rib tips were so fatty that we really got very little meat and were still hungry at the end of out meat.  so we very shamelessly walked to blackdog across the way for some brisket and burnt ends, really!.  we got 2 slices of bread, maybe french...thats it, no butter or some nice spread to go with it, good but nothing special.  im really hoping this place is successful...i want to be supportive but like other reviewers, there is better bbq around but i will go back for that coleslaw!!!!!!!
ive been here and had fishchips friday special? and rib tips. both were nice, while i would not call it special. i liked this place mostly because the restaurant was quite, and the waiters if i could call them waiters were friendly.
im glad desyree is back making her gelato again.  its about the same distance from home as her previous location but its an easier drive now. i stopped in to finally see the new place and try some of her good gelato.  i was greeted warmly and desyree continues to be one of the friendliest people there is in the business.i took my time looking at the different offerings and i went with a 6 ounce serving of pistachio baklava.  i also ordered two nutella biscuits and a millefoglie to bring home.there wasnt much of a pistachio flavor to the gelato.  i knew it was pistachio by the chunks of those nuts in the mix.  the baklava was ok but the gelato wasnt as creamy as i was used to. i didnt think the gelato was as creamy as what id had before. of the pastries i brought home, the nutella cookies were outstanding while the mille foglie was disappointing with little dulce de leche between the layers.  i think i should have stuck with the gorgonzola and pear that i liked so much.  i found this first visit underwhelming.
desyree, the chef and owner is such a sweet lady.  well respected, very creative, shes very personable and takes the time to get to know you.  i really admire her and her business will prosper with her creativity and her character.  if you follow her on instagram, you will be notified on the flavors of the day.  all her gelatos are good.  the fat elvis is one of my favorites.  the only thing was some of the gelatos lacked flavor.  for example, i had the oatmeal, cranberry, and nut gelato, and while it was good, it lacked the actual oatmeal, cranberry, and nut flavor.  alot of the natural chunks of the particular flavors seem to only be on top and not well mixed in.  so with the oatmeal cranberry, i only had very little of the actual oatmeal, cranberry, and nut chunks.  very little. i had the bread pudding flavor, and there was barely any bread pudding chunks in the actual gelato.  plenty when you see it on the case, but only on the top, and the chunks dont seem to be mixed in very well.   maybe im just very picky with gelato.  i would still recommend this place to anyone whos feeling adventurous with nontraditional gelato flavors.
i really wanted to like this place.  the rave reviews set the bar high and i was expecting to be amazed.  that unfortunately did not happen.    things started going south as i watched the gentlemen half pack the gelato while his coworker was slamming down the folks container behind me.  she packed down theirs giving them their moneys worth.  i felt cheated but was going to chalk it up to training deficiencies.      i got three orders of gelato and he wrapped them nicely but once i got home figuring out which gelato was whose was impossible.  they all looked very similar.      what really disappointed me was the 2 macaroons i bought.  they were way old  34 days.  they were hard and inedible.  this to me is unacceptable and makes me question everything they sell.     the gelato to me was nothing special.  i would rather have had yogurt.  the price is on the high side and the quality does not support the cost.  i wont be returning,
the 4.99 lunch special offered monday through friday from 11 a.m to 2 p.m. is what lured me in. plus, ive been wanting to try this place out ever since i seen the now open sign. i love me some indian food! indian bowl cuisine is located off maryland right across from unlv in the chipotle shopping center. this small casual restaurant has plenty of seating and offers quick carry out. i ordered at the register, the owner piled in the food in a styrofoam tray, and i was on my way. i was in and out within 5 minutes.   the lunch special comes with rice and one main entree. theres two different types of rice to choose from. i can only describe the rice i chose as tamarind rice. most of the tray was filled up with this rice. for my entree, i got the saag aloo potatoes with spinach in a spicy sauce. there was also chana masala a chickpea entree as another vegetarian option. the potatoes werent as soft as id like, but the spiciness level was perfect. i was going to order the vegetarian samosas but was told they take 10 minutes to make from scratch. maybe next time.worth a return visit?im glad to have another lunch option around unlv, and i hope indian bowl cuisine is successful. my meal was just okay, but super cheap! cant beat a 4.99 lunch.yelp 100 challenge 2015: 174
gave this place a try for the first time. the lunch special was good, i had my favorite indian dish, aloo gobi. however, do your research on the menu items, the owners do not understand what vegan means. if they tell you its vegan, dont buy it for a second. they did a really convincing job at assuring me the dessert i wanted was vegan. i am lactose intolerant. lesson learned.
located near unlv, seems to be  solid lunch option for students and staff many other reviews mention the lunch combos, but either theyve done away with that or its not available on weekends, because i arrived to menu of madetoorder entrees. i liked that there were so many vegetarian options, but without my favorite saag paneer available or tikka masala, for the nonveg options, i chose the special of the day: lamb curry, with the cumin rice, and a samosa.service was polite, food was made to order and packed up for takeout, price 12 was reasonable for the portion size. i asked for a 6 on their spice scale 110 and found it quite mild, but the curry sauce was thick and there was ample lamb. food had a little more grease than i had expected, and i poured some off of the curry rather than ingest it. samosa was just okay. quality is better than some of the other studentfocused places on this side of the street.
ordered the mongolian beef sesame chicken combination fried rice and calamari. everything was good except the calamari it was hard couldnt even taste the calamari and if you did it was rubbery. overall the sesame chicken was the best thing about the meal.
i had high expectations for the dumplings due to rave reviews. the pork and cabbage dumplings were okay. i thought it was bland. the shrimp dumplings were a surprise...i questioned if it had any shrimp in it since they were over powered by the ground meat inside. the panfried dumplings lacked a crisp. i preferred the steamed ones more. beef chow fun in black bean sauce was 3 stars okay. the flavor was not as rich as i had expected. the beef in it was very tender and juicy, and quite enjoyable. mabo tofu good, but maybe i hardly get blown away by this dish as a general item. it was underwhelming when it was first served, so we asked them to make it look more like the photo. the owner was super cool and remade this dish, which was a significant improvement. fried calamari was not bad either. good stuff. sesame chicken good. nice crunch and chicken was tender. they have an endless selection for their smoothies with boba. i got to try 5 different ones, and i gotta, say the cantaloupe was my favorite, with black sesame coming in second. great service, owner is super nice, and very clean. we got a real kick out of the koi fish paper posters in the frames.i may be back, but will try more of the authentic dishes that others have reviewed.
came here for the first time. ordered yung zhou fried rice and teriyaki beef bowl. i can honestly say the vegetables in the dish was very fresh and prepared just right. however the fried rice was lack of flavor and the beef bowl was just some beef covered with regular teriyaki sauce on top of lots of steam rice for almost 9....not worth the money. they do have a very extensive menu of drinks that you can choose from. compared with other chinese restaurants we have been to, this place would not be on top of my list.
we been to this location serial times for different ethnic foods but all not survived. we give it a try since its new  so we ordered all three different types of dumplings  shrimp, pork  cabbage, and fish. out of three , we liked the shrimp dumpling most and all were juicy,  but lack a bit of flavor. overall, not too bad will be back for their fresh fruit smoothie though.
food was ok, service was slow. i would recommend coming here when its not busy. or getting take out.
food ok  rice and beans bland and beans came cold i like melted cheese. chunky salsa was not spicy at all and tasted like it came straight from a jar. taco meat was pretty good though i recommend the pulled chicken. cilantro, red onions and fresh pico de gallo would be great if offered in the salsa bar and also extra hot salsa would be nice for those who like heat. good service.
we arrived at 10:05 and were disappointed that the menudo was not ready which was the reason we went.  the horchata was not homemade and was on the sweet side with no hint of cinnamon. i had huevos a la mexicana and it was ok. the best item we ordered was the carne asada quesadilla. i will try it again to try their street tacos.
i ordered the 3 taco meal all barbacoa.  the meat had good flavor and the medium salsa was perfect.  the reason for the 3 stars was this....although the rice and beans are considered fillers  they should still taste great when it cost about 9.00 for the lunch plate.  i thought the beans were a bit too thick and the rice was about 2 more minutes from smelling spoiled :  i also docked a star since i also had to wait about 20 minutes and they werent busy at all. i hope these are just some growing pains.  ill give it another try in a few months or so.
the server was super nice. theres salsa bar which had some amazing guacamole, i totally reccomend it. the tacos are simple which is good in its own way. the breakfast burito ok too. overall its an enjoyable experience. only one thing wrong. when going to take my order i saw a cockroach on the ground. even upon sitting down i saw 2 baby cockroaches on my table. maybe itll be cleaner next time.
this place has a lot of potential....i paid 30.00 for a carne asada burrito, 3 shrimp tacos and two drinks....i would pay that for a burrito that was to big for me to finish and some killer shrimp tacos but neither met those criteria...the menu could be organized much better..........so to the owner here is my personal opinion of how to better things: menu  you got to much repetitive stuff on there. you are either a build your own tacos, tortas and burritos or your not.....if you are then i just need to know the types of meats and extras that i can choose from.....if your not build your own then just tell me what is included in the tacos, tortas and burritos beside the meat......beans you either have refried or black beans not frijoles or black beans.......the shrimp tacos needs more substance mainly from the shrimp need a better batter and serve it with shredded cabage, chopped tomatoes with chopped white onion and cilantro, lightly squeezed lime topped with a cream either crema or guacamole cream........my burrito was almost flat. the flavor of the meat was very good but wasnt worth the price...you have something good here just need to up the food in order to require customers to pay 30.00 for a burrito, 3 tacos and 2 drinks....customer service was great.......guys are very friendly and attentive
cute place, very clean. the menu is easy to read thats above the counter, but the menus im the table werent as easy. i got an el pastor and fish street taco. nicely presented, but the el pastor too spicy for me and i didnt care for the smoky flavor of the sauce. i barely had any pineapple and the ones that were there were so small i couldnt taste them. the meat was more like a pulled pork, it was moist and had a good flavor. i wouldnt prefer it again as i dont like good that spicy. the fish was crispy and had good flavor, but again, too spicy for me.overall was good, but was a bit expensive. probably wouldnt come back.we didnt get refills on our waters until we were pretty much done with lunch. disappointing service.
just was not a huge fan. i ordered 3 street tacos.  barbacoa, smoked pork a smoked chicken.  i was not crazy about any of them. the guacamole and chips were the best part of the meal.  ill stick to my favorite hole in the wall.
vraiment appreciee le cote enfant friendly avec un menu pour eux!
i have actually been going to this car wash regularly since they opened, i even bought an ultimate unlimited pass. today, i pulled in with only one car in the other lane. i waited 5 mins while the attendant explained the different packages  i didnt have a problem with this as they are a brand new place. the attendant signaled twice that they would be right over again, this was all fine by me.  the car went through and it was my turn but instead the attendant did not help me but proceeded to help the car that had just pulled up. this pissed me off so i backed out and left. hopefully, this was just an accident but im not sure i will be returning.
i want to really like this place. the car wash is pretty good for the membership price i signed up for. the free vacuums are awesome too. but i have been here 6 times and 3 of the times the tunnel has been down and im getting really annoyed. the first time the attendant came up and explained to me want was going on, and gave me a coupon. this time no one even came up to any of the 4 cars trying to figure out what was going on to explain why the lanes were blocked off. hopefully they can figure it out. maybe its just been bad timing!!
located in the korea town shopping center inside greenland supermarket or their entrance outside right next to the supermarket, dream bean coffee offers a small menu of iced and hot coffees with shaved ice available for snacking.while i was doing errands on a hot summer day, i entered to get a quick boost of energy and something sweet to eat and possibly cool down my already rising temperature. i ordered the iced hazelnut americano and had a small mango shaved ice bowl. the iced americano wasnt really up to par with some of the other coffee places ive been to in vegas... im no coffee expert at all and i know americanos are made by combining hot water in this case cold water and over ice and espresso, but there was something offtasting about this drink. i really didnt like it because it left a weird after taste in my mouth. i usually get americanos if i need a quick boost of energy, but this one did not do it for me.the mango shaved ice was very sweet. the mangos, even though a bit overripe, went will with the mango syrup and ice cream. mix it all together in your bowl and you have a nice little refreshing snack to cool you off from the 100 degree weather outside!the ladies working there were extremely nice, but i wouldnt go out of my way to get coffee from here.
dream bean seems to have replaced another coffee shop in this space just outside greenland market i like how its one of the few spaces in the plaza that is reliably clean and friendly, no language barriers. the exterior entrance is also convenient.menu includes hot, cold, and blended coffee and noncoffee beverages the pistachio latte is popular, with a limited food menu fish cakes with red bean and other desserts. the interior is the same as the previous owners, with a clean and homey theme of wallquotes and sitting areas. prices are a bit higher than i remember, with extra charges for both flavoring syrups 50 cents and alternative milks 69 cents, which bring the otherwise reasonably low coffee prices starbuckshigh if you want anything other than basic coffee or their featured beverage currently a pumpkinspice latte.
new locationmiricale mile delicatessen moved from the collonade to 4433 n 16th st, phoenix, az,  located on the se corner of campbell and 16th st. the new location is clean, spacious, and absolutely beautiful.the food, service, management, and  new building are all great.  whatever your favorite deli food is you will find it at miracle mile.i have been to miricale mile dozens of times and the food is always good.  however, todays visit was different.  something was just off.  i chalked it up to a bad day and ordering the wrong entree.  the sandwich i ordered bbq beef just didnt taste good.  the meat was overcooked, very dry, and the potato salad wasnt any better.miracle mile is a family owned and operated business and the customer service is second to none.  this visit wont stop me from revisiting miracle mile but it was very disappointing..
nice new building and location for miracle mile. i had a light appetite so i ordered the chili. i know chili in july. who does that in arizona when its over 100 degres outside! however the chili was good. miracle has a variety of foods to order. like cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, salads, soups, and deserts. they even have cabbage. i was shocked to see beer and wine offered. funny thing though; i looked around to get a good look at the place. and i noticed it was filled with senior citizens. so im not sure if miracle mile on 16th street and campbell is a senior citizen hangout. or if it was senior citizen day. perhaps there was a senior citizen party. dont get me wrong i love seniors. however it was just odd to see so many in one place, at one time... on the positive side it was nice to see all types of people get out and enjoy theirself at miracle mile.recommendation: the chili i ordered was good;  however nothing to brag about. i did notice they have hefty portions of cakes:. a decent and clean place to go if u have a light or no appeitite in particular. since there is a variety of different foods to order.
i can see why this place is busy and popular: fast service, conveient for all the business people going to lunch, and most importantly good food. my recommendation: if its your first time try not to go at 12:00 because the staff is busy and rushed. i had not been here before and 1 of the staff out of the 5 i encountered actually listened to what i wanted to order. i ordered a custom turkey sandwich bacon, turkey, chipotle mayo, cheddar cheese when the guy just started to put lettuce and mayo on my sandwich and i had to cut him off and tell him again what i wanted. he put regular mayo and then one of the other staff stepped in and told him i wanted chipotle mayo. i was going to let it slide and not say anything, so he ended up putting both on which i said was fine. the mac and cheese was very good and fresh. the wheat bread for my sandwich was very good also. everything tastes fabulous! this place just needs to work on listening to their customers and not making them feel as rushed.
i like the one at the colonnade better.been going here since it was downtown, in scottsdale fashion square, scottsdale  and frank lloyd wright,park central, arrowhead,christown 40 plus years.  lots of punch cards. went for lunch at the new one.   nice but no punim, bland as the food ..  never before have i had a new yorker that fit in my hand. the portion sizes were smaller, the coleslaw was plain.... never at miracle mile in all the years have i ever had bland pastrami. a roll that previous generations would never served...  the old location was fine. now that new one is built , lets build a bakery that will give us the same quality rolls breads there used to be.lets taste the food when it is made, before it is served.old school food in a new restaurant that is the goal. so josh ,start tasting .barry
miracle mile is what i would call a fast food deli. you get in a line and move down the counter much like a buffet, except there are people making what you order. you then pay and find a seat or take it to go. i ordered a hot pastrami on rye. it was just good, not great. kind of a let down compared to the great deli shops. the concept miracle mile uses isnt that great if you want great quality food put out. how can there be with a busy assembly line? there is no real quality control here. i love deli food and have to many around town and in other states. this one just doesnt compare. sorry miracle mile, but you wont make the cut when i want my next deli fix.
super excited to try a new locally owned bagel joint. arriving at odelay, its clear that some thought was put into all the design and esthetics. outside is a large water cooler that is solely there to fill the large dog water bowl below as a dog person i think that is super rad, 3 points odelay. entering the business and you see a beautiful rustic wood wall and other great design elements. as i waited in line, i observed the employee at the counter struggling to get the ipad to accept the credit card payment of the customer ahead of me. for about ten minutes she tried to run the card and it wouldnt take. the customer was clearly getting annoyed understandably and i felt bad for the employee, as its not her fault that the system was buggy.  i was trying to send the employee an esp message to offer the customer a free coffee or comp one of the bagels something to make up for the very long delay. but nothing. when the customer finally got her order she was clearly unhappy and left the place quickly. i can guarantee that a free coffee or bagel for her would have made a lifelong customer, but i bet she never returns. when its my turn i order a half dozen bagels and a single serve side of butter. im charged 10.84. i pay and dont really think about it, but then realize i just paid 3.00 for a tiny side of butter. that is insane, because thats the price of half dozen and a decent side of cream cheese. so a tiny side of butter is the same price as a large cream cheese here somehow?getting home the bagels were better than average, but a bit undercooked. strangely there seemed to be a million sesame seeds on each bagel but none of them wanted to remain on the bagel. weird. overall this place is better than einsteins, but not as good as chompies. i highly suggest some front of house training to learn how to fix little mistakes and ensure you dont lose customers. there is a lack of communication between the cashier and prep staff.  it seemed as though the employee didnt know what to charge for a tiny butter, so i ended up paying the same price as i would have for a decent sized cream cheese.   i wish them all the best, but for me this place is one and done.
went on opening day around 9:30 and was shocked that there wasnt a crowd.  i agree with the reviewer that the cashier was blank and not very personable.  maybe she was stressed, but a smile will go a long way. i too noticed just one trash bin inside. would be nice to have the coffee urns on the counter like the rh location. makes for speedier refills when the line is busy with more complicated requests. enjoyed the freshness of th pastries. also this location seems roomier and the patio is a huge plus. all in all i give it 3.5 stars.
i sincerely hope it was because theyre working out the kinks, but our visit last weekend was a big disappointment. we love the pistachio macarons and we seemed to have gotten an old batch maybe it was overcooked? the normal crunchychewy delight was replaced by a solid, crumbly bite for more than 2 a cookie, it has to be right!   the ladies who waited on us seemed like we were a bit of a bother and they were not busy  the seating isnt as cozy as the noda or fort mill locations, but its a bigger space  so i can appreciate theyre fine tuning. the overwhelming smell of floor varnish was a little disruptive too but i trust this will pass as time goes on. the water stationtrash can debacle mentioned by others is accurate even on a sunday evening when its not jam packed.
cute quirky cafe with some very nice pastries and decent coffee. unfortunately although there were sufficient numbers of staff they seem to be extremely undertrained. many people waited inordinate amounts of time while  the staff seemed unsure of what to do and without direction. this place has a lot of potential but someone needs to take control and management needs to be present. the cleanliness was extremely lacking as well.
the desserts are excellent, but the prices are outrageously high; more expensive than major cities like new york or los angeles. great atmosphere, good service, just know going in that a few bites of cake will cost more than 5. its good cake, but...yea. too expensive.
the ambiance and decor of this restaurant give it the third star. however the food is so hit and miss. the black forrest ham and gruyere sandwich is to die for, and probably the only thing ill order from them from now on. the croissants are soggy. all of them. almond twice baked, plain, pan au chocolat. all terrible. soggy, too sweet, and cakey. a croissant should be flakey! the macaroons are overpriced, napoleons can be soggy depending on which amelies youre visiting. coffee is hit or miss as well depending on the barista. overall, amelies is a nice place to grab a tea and hook on to some free wifi. but, the food is mediocre, with a combination of a few stellar items and a more letdowns.
so happy there is a new location for those in south charlotte. i actually like this location so much more! heres why: 1. more spacious layout its more open than the other amelies in noda. 2. not as crowded, easier to find a table! 3. same lovely decor and food as the other amelies.4. outdoor seating as for the food, ive been to amelies so many times to know whats good now. the salted caramel brownies are a must try they are a bit heavy though so splitting one is a perfect amount. i love the macaroons there! the fruit tarts are cute but i dont think they are worth the price. also, the creme brulee isnt that worth it either. i would try the other desserts that arent as sweet like croissants! free wifi!
there seems to be something missing. i was really excited about amelies coming to south charlotte. i am in a long, drawn out love affair with their salted caramel brownies  like everyone else in charlotte. the food is ok. im currently crunching on a turkey and brie sandwich... but its just ok. even the caramel brownie isnt out of this world like i have experienced at the other location. just something off.this location is more open and easier to navigate. theres a place for a line to form, plenty of seating, and an outdoor patio where the love locks live. its all nice, but theres nothing fancy or hidden gem about this place. this isnt the quiet study spot that i expected it to be, but maybe im comparing it too much to noda? the staff doesnt help much either. ive been here 3 or 4 times and every time i feel like im not hip enough  and lord knows, it could just be me. haha. when i order at the counter, i feel like im interrupting something, or not doing it right. theres not a whole lot of explanation  more what do you want?. nah mean?so, ill continue eating my sandwich and floating on their wifi. im not in love with this location like i thought i would be. i think if i didnt know what to expect, and had never heard of amelies, it might bring in another star  but only for the unique decorating. its fine, and ill come here again for coffee... womp womp
we went for breakfast on saturday.  we arrived around 9:3010ish and the display cases were so bare!  i wanted to get something yummy and decadent but ended up getting a breakfast sandwich.  unfortunately, something was wrong with every one of four our orders; the bread was toasted and it wasnt supposed to be, the egg was scrambled and it was supposed to be over easy, etc....  i ordered one of the french sodas and the barista was yelling my name to pick it up while i was still trying to pay for my order.  i waved at her to acknowledge, but she grew obviously impatient. when i went over there, she had my order wrong! i will go back again but hope the service is better.
im disappointed with this location and after reading the other reviews i can see im not the only one. the quality of the pastries just isnt like what you find at the noda location but theyre still good. my main concern is the staff. they are disinterested to the point of rudeness. im not the sort to expect servers to fall all over themselves at my expense so when i say theyre bad, they are definitely bad. please amelies, hire people who dont treat your customers like an inconvenience. i know you know this is a problem, ive seen your responses to other reviews.
spotty. sometimes excellent; sometimes mediocre. the meat turkey is sometimes plentiful in sandwiches, sometimes barely there. and then i walk out hungry. also, dont  chop up the egg before placing in breakfast sandwich  one bite and it all falls out from all angles  even onto floor. first time i ordered breakfast sandwich, the egg was folded once inside and solid so i didnt lose any. also, trash is still piling up by the coffeetea condiments area.  take it all directly to the back. no one wants to sit by that mess. finally, the coffee bar  theres a barista who uses her bare hands to level grinds in scoop that she first wipes with a dirty rag. no! use a clean, coffeededicated tool to slice off top of grinds. tap out scoops instead of wiping with rags.
very decent for the area. nothing like this around. very expensive. was cool for a few weeks. now its nothing special to me. but if you have no tried it. give the place a shot.
i work in the area and thought i would visit more often than i do.  the hype was great.  and ive never visited the other location so i was dying to try this.  im not big on their macaroons.  a bit too fluffy for me.  its more cake like than i like my macaroons.  the cakes are pretty good.  the eclairs are delicious though.  same with the salted caramel brownies.  and they have meringues that they do in different flavors sometimes.  those are a deal and super yummy.  the restaurant itself is so relaxing and inviting that i could find it hard to leave when im relaxing with some friends or my sisters and family there.  there is always a line.  but it does move along pretty quick.  their coffee can use some work.  mine was pretty weak and i asked for the strongest blend they had.
i find the staff to be very unprofessional. they gossip audibly and loudly in the presence of customers. the pastries are overpriced but are good. a good atmosphere. so i guess my biggest issue is the unprofessional staff and inflated prices.
the food and beer were pretty great, but the wait staff was abysmal. this would easily be a 4 or 5 star review if it wasnt for the waitress. my girlfriend and i came to hopcat on a tuesday night, drawn in by what wed heard about their fries, vegetarian options and extensive beer menu. the crack fries were fantastic, and the fish and chips were on point. she had the kitchen sink and she was ranting and raving. the waitress was quick to bring us our beers but that was about the only time she was quick. we waited about 15 minutes after that to even place our food order, and then another 15 to get the bill, after she had said shed bring it right out. we had a small twoseater table at the end of the first floor room, uncomfortably close to a rambunctious table of eight, so perhaps our presence was a bit overshadowed. nonetheless, we were there first and our waitress wasnt even the one to bring any food out. she simply asked us if we were doing alright a couple times. ill reiterate  the food was fantastic. everything i was hoping for. the beer is worth coming back for, but i think ill sit at the bar next time.
this place just opened in july 2015, and the word is out, because its busy! they have 130 beers on tap! youre sure to find something youll like. they also have a full bar, if youre in the mood for a cocktail. as for food, theyve got great appetizers and yummy burgers. their crack fries have been rated top ten french fries in america by the food network. so i tried the loaded crack fries: crack fries topped with cherry smoked bacon, red onion, jalapenos and five pepper beef chili, smothered in warm cheese sauce. they call them crack fries because theyre addictive, and they did not disappoint. my only complaint would be that the bar service couldve been better. we grabbed seats at the bar, and they were pretty busy, but it took quite a while for one of five bartenders to finally greet us and offer us a beverage.
this place was aok. the good:  wide selection of beers, including very funky ones, pretty darn good veggie chili,the aok: the pork schnitzel: date was impressed, i found it to be just as expected  not outstanding, but not bad either.  atmosphere is pretty cool  i would describe it to be in the same ballpark as buffalo wild wings, but bdubs is bears and hop cat is packers. the bad:  vladimir poutine the dumplings were stale.  the beer descriptions the triple goddess raspberry kombucha sounds like it may sweet with a hint of the kombucha vinegar taste, but being a kombucha it has the potential to taste exactly like vinegar with a dash of sweet. so i asked the waitress about it, and she said it was very sweet; sweet with a hint of vinegar taste sounds delicious to me, so i ordered. what came was not sweet in any sense of the word, and the vinegar taste was overwhelming. perhaps i got what i deserved ordering a kombucha, but i did feel a bit mislead by the waitress. outside of that, the service was pretty friendly. recommendation:  sit at the bar, ask for beer recommendations from the bartender, and stay away from the vladimir poutine i heard the uncomplicated crack fries are good though.
extensive beer selection on tap with rotating seasonal specials. they will do beer flights if you ask the bar tender.
this place is so new and always packed. i honestly saw a line out the door on game day! i just think the food and atmosphere is fine.i really like the murals on the walls. its a really open layout. its way too cold inside!as for the food, my husband and i started off with a super cheesy spinach dip. it was burnt, but still tasty.he got the paddy melt and i got a veggie burger with a chipotle muenster cheese spread. he said his sandwich was good tasting but incredibly greasy, so he felt sick afterward. my veggie burger was so dry and boring. i couldnt taste the cheese at all. about a week later, we both struggled to remember what we even ordered. but we did remember the crack fries! those were very addictive, and definitely named well. i think in the future id like to just come in for fries? haha.great beer selection, but not a great selection for people like me who dont like beer. my husband had fun choosing and really liked his dark beer. i wanted a hard cider but a lot were out of stock, and then the ones left were just way too pricey. i ended up getting the house white wine, which was probably the worst wine ive had in years and years. so, theres that. i was under the impression that theres cocktail choices too, but didnt see the alcohol nor any hard alcohol on the menu
amazing beer selection, okay food but bartenders that are really bad at noticing when someone needs a drink.
crack fries are delicious but the rest of the meal fell flat. ordered the blt benny and the eggs tasted gummy.. not the way i like my eggs! the eggs ranchero was okay.. nothing special or to write home about. atmosphere was kinda meh but it was the only place without a line for brunch so i guess i shouldnt complain!
so many beers on tap its nutterbutters! im consistently impressed with the range of beers and the knowledgeable bar tenders who are always able to recommend a great beer. the space itself is huge; 2 wide open floors with a giant wrap around bar and lots of booth and table top seating. its a great place for a large group, especially around happy hour and is unique in that it is one of the few bars that consistently has enough space for a group gathering, which is great!other than large parties, the space feels a little large and overwhelming for a smaller group. the crack fries get a lot of hype, and theyre pretty decent, but neither the fries nor other food burgers, apps really stands out as anything special.
i love the huge selection of beers but the food is just ok. nothing special at all, even when there are menu items called crack fries, which youd think would be super addicting, but are just meh. most beers you can get around town, so id go somewhere with better food if i was going to go out for a beer.
good was good. i had the fish sandwich. the three stars is mainly service time. took almost 10 minutes to get a server to take our drink order. at present im sitting at the table having been waiting for the check for 1015 minutes for the bill. very slow service. inattentive server. beer selection is good though they were out of the cider i wanted to try. might be back but would get better service at coopers or mr brews.
we stopped in on a rainy halloween saturday after the badgers game.  understandably, the restaurant was slammed but we were able to secure a few barstools at the ginormous bar.  we were at the bar for about an hour before deciding to order food and then waiting almost that long to finally receive it.  service was painfully slow and there is no excuse.  a halloween saturday and a badger game necessitates extra staffing, this wasnt the case here.  a big thumbs down to the female bartender dressed as a tmnt who looked at me as i was trying to flag her down and then simply walk away.  yeah, it probably sucks that you are getting slammed but a simple acknowledgement is all that was needed. already on the fence on whether this would be a place to visit more, this tipped me to the no side.  besides almost the overwhelming selection of beer, poor service and aok food wont cut it for me.
hop cat is good... the food is good just your typical american style... great fries.... and an excellent beer selection... my gripe with this place is the  seating its to close to the bar... both visits i was bumped by the bar patrons...
salsaritas is located in the main atrium, between the b and c concourses. theres also an express location elsewhere in the airport.this is a full salsaritas with the usual burritos, nachos and such. there was a short line to get started, but its the same service as youve seen at other burrito joints where you order and go down the assembly line of protein meats and veggies available, toppings and cheese. at the end, its wrapped up and ready to go.my chicken burrito was decently stuffed with chicken and the guacamole was a bit more loose than i prefer but still tasty. it needed hot sauce.still, easy to grab and go, easy to eat on the plane!
its always a challenge to find healthy food at the airport. though the food is average, there are lots of options to customize. small size is a huge portion. the medium salsa adds a nice kick and really brings up the flavor regular salsa is bland. a little on the pricey side depending what you get, but overall a great option compared to cinnabon or burger king.
soubois is excellent for its vibe and crowd. soubois as of september 2015 is the place to be seen, according to my montreal based friends. on a saturday night, the place was packed with great looking people. the cocktails were delicious and their wine offering was extensive. i easily found a few of my favorite reds on the list and devoured a bunch.as for food, there are some dishes that seem to be better than others. i particularly enjoyed the decadent poutine with foie gras, wild mushrooms, cheese curds and gravy. the seafood platter with oysters, crab cakes, mussles and clams were quite nice also. i was mixed on the charcuterie platter  while i thoroughly enjoyed the foie gras pate and cold cuts, i didnt enjoy the pickled peppers spread along the length of the platter  i felt like it detracted from the spread. i was also left mixed feeling about the mains. i had a mushroom spaghetti. the sauce, the mushrooms and spaghetti itself were pretty good. but the large dollop of mozzarella took away from the rest of the dish. the steaks that many others in my dining party ordered did not particularly look appealing to me either. in any case, i would recommend this venue for a dinner andor drinks for its very cool vibe!
being from canada, its hard to find a good poutine south of the boarder. but they do a pretty good job. kinda pricy and they try to fancy it up a lot, but tasty and fresh. they do make a homemade burger and it is amazing!
small place on mill avenue. the restaurant has long tables for people to share and eat at with a few tables. the menu is small with mainly poutine.we tried the chili corn poutine and pot roast poutine, the biggest disappointment was  no eegees!!the poutine was a different meal but not bad. inexpensive and pretty tasty with a good selection to choose from.
tried this place out for the first time with a canadian buddy.  id only had poutine once before in verrado and it was amazing!!!!  i was really looking forward to having it again.  i ordered a combo, which was difficult to figure out how the combos worked, with a burger and side of traditional poutine.  my buddy also ordered a burger with a side of fries.  our meal came up to almost 30!  way too much for what you get.quality of food was ok.  fries are nothing to brag about which is sad since fries is in the name of the restaurant.  gravy was good and cheese curds didnt have much flavor.  the burger was good, but very small.  meat was tasty and loved the bread.  i may try this place again and order something different, but i have a hard time justifying the cost.customer service was great!!!  place looks great, too!
i was excited to see us fries come up because ive had poutine fries at other restaurants  really enjoyed them. i gave this place 2 chances before deciding what to rate it. this review is more like 2.5 stars  im rounding up.the first time, i ordered the vegetarian poutine was really disappointed. the onions  peppers were too mushy  made for a big sloppy mess with the gravy  soft fries cheese curds also included.i didnt find this worth the return trip but gave it the benefit of the doubt  decided to go back about a week later.the second time, i ordered the chili corn poutine. although it was much better than the previous one, i wasnt impressed. th chili was mediocre at best  unfortunately there was too much gravy that had sank to the bottom. additionally, the price was a little bit over 8!i might return but not anytime soon.
they were very friendly and the service was excellent.  our poutine was tasty although i think they went a little skinny on the cheese curds.  i know brown gravy is traditional but when the husband makes it at home, he uses homemade turkey gravy...  so i think im spoiled.  i didnt like the brown gravy as much.
my wife is from montreal and poutine is a staple there, so when we found out about us fries we had to try it.we live in way east mesa, so it was about a 20 minute drive to get there.  octoberfest was going on, so traffic was a bit heavy once we got off the freeway, but we found parking on the street about a five minute walk from the restaurant and we felt happy.when we arrived, there were only 3 other people inside and thought the service might be fast.  but about a minute after us about 10 more people arrived.  not too bad for a typical fast food joint, but there was only one person working.  just one person working at 4:37 pm on busy sunday.  i think her name was vivian very nice girl and very busy took all of the orders first then started cooking.  she came and apoligized that it was going to take awhile.  it did.  she finally got some help after about 15 minutes, and the two of them hammered out all of the meals, which took maybe 2025 minutes to get ours.the food was decent, but i doubt i will make any special trips to get there again.  we each had a 13 rd pound burger and traditional poutine combo, each had a soda and we shared an order of cheese curds.  the price was over 30.00 which makes for a pretty expensive meal.  the burgers alone, which are pretty basic, but tasty were 6.99 each.the poutine was decent but we make better at home, and at much less cost.if you have never tried poutine before, go ahead and go and check them out, but remember, there is better values else where.
i heard rave things about. we went in for dinner and i was pleased with their selection. it didnt taste bad, but it didnt wow me.breaking it down, it was french fries with sauce on it. and some meat and cheese too... im not sure if that was worth the 10. and everything was put in to go boxes so the presentation was not that great.its good to try. but its expensive for fast food, and its really not a lot of food.
my coworker and i checked out the counter for lunch yesterday. we liked it, but we didnt love it. marios the type of person who can eat a moderate sized meal and be full for hours; i, however, am hungry within an hour of eating. so while he was content with the portions well into the afternoon, i couldnt wait to eat something more which lead to another afternoon burying my face in a bucket of froyo.the food itself was good. we started with the sweet sriracha fries. they were pretty good and we devoured them before our burgers arrived. while many of the specialty burgers sounded great, we opted to build our own burgers. my bacon of course and jalapeno cheese burger, with dill pickles and spinach was perfectly cooked to medium. it wasnt greasy, which was pleasant.service was attentive without being suffocating. yeah, it felt like we waited a while to get our food. but it was also incredibly fresh, so compromise. i understand we all have limited time for our lunches downtown, so when we go back we may call ahead to have an order ready for dining in.
the counter is so conveniently located, its hard not to pass by without thinking of stopping in for a bite to eat. thats why ive been back twice since my first visit when i couldnt get take out  but we wont speak of that again.for my second visit, i dinedin and sat at the bar. thought i chose a good spot, but folks still bumped me as they passed behind. next time  table only. the couple next to me was sharing a burger and side. not sure if it filled their bellies, but they seemed to enjoy every bite. on my other side someone ordered a grilled cheese without side. looked a bit skimpy, so i cant imagine how filling that could have been.every dish coming out of the kitchen looked yummy. the burgers were stacked and even though im not much of a flesh eater, i was thinking dayum, me want burger.anyway, reality. like i said in my first review: i would be the idiot who went all veggie on em. so my buildyourownburger sans burger turned out to be a bowl of salad. with a side order of yam fries without question.i was impressed with the salad  very fresh, very crisp, very green, very good. and the yam fries were tasty. salted, not sweeted like other restaurants are serving them. the contrast of sweet to salty flavor was excellent and the fries accompanied my salad con mucho harmony. tongue was happy, tummy be happy, me happy.for my third visit i had a jones for yam fries! or sweet pos as some folk calls em. i ordered take out. decided on the buildyourowngrilled cheese. requested all kinds of fixins. in my head, i pictured the guys in the kitchen stuffing topping after topping between slices of bread and wrapping up a fat sammich for me  just like the fat burgers they serve. nope, wrong answer. my grilled cheese was still on the skimpy side, though not as skimped as the grilled cheese the woman had during my second visit. when i got to my destination, i added two more toppings of my own. dont get me wrong, it was a good sandwich, but nothing ticks me off more than having to redress something that was buildyourown in the first place. tsk, tsk. sweet pos were a total failure. i ate them straight from the box, but they tasted like the kitchen had either rewarmed them or twice fried overcooked them.smh. what does disappointment mean?noun the feeling of sadness or displeasure caused by the nonfulfillment of ones hopes or expectations.my jones was gones.
i was so excited to check out the counter since it is right down the street from where i live.  the staff was very welcoming when i arrived and i found a seat at the bar.  both bartenders were exceptionally nice too.  i ordered a custom turkey burger with fries.  the fries were great, but the turkey burger was dry and got lost on the big pretzel bun.  i am hoping i just ordered the wrong thing and it isnt a sign of the entire quality of the menu.
had the bbq2 burger but salad style. imagine a burger patty without a bun on a bed of lettuce. it was good but not amazing and not worth the price. the best part was the veggie skewers.  my sister got a regular burger and liked it. ill always try a place twice. will post another status if my thoughts change.
a friend brought me by this place, he is vegan and yes they offer vegan options!  they have a pretty large menu, and if youre not feeling any of the items that they have to offer they had a wide array of patties, cheese, bread and toppings for you to choos from, so that you can customize your own buger!  the location of the restaurant is great, the lightrail is right in front of it!
i give them 3 stars because the sweet sriracha fries are out of this world!!! when i came here, the place had only been open for a few weeks and it was obvious.  it was really slow and the service was not very good.  the burger was mediocre at best, but the large selection of dipping sauces was awesome.  i would come back for the sriracha fries, but nothing else.
ive been here twice now and each time my food was overcooked.  for the price youd think someone in the kitchen would be capable of cooking a medium buger. the manager and staff were very nice and took care to make sure the second burger was cooked correctly.  i give them 3 stars for customer service, but doubt ill go back for a 3rd try. thanks anyway!
bison burger is what i ordered. it tasted fabulous. .. but my bill was 22.00... before tip so a lil too expensive... also they were skimpy on the sauce provided on side.  my order was not perfect  for 22.00 it should have been perfect... i was on my lunch break... not the greatest service but okay. fries should have been more like 1.50 instead of 3.00..... place seemed pretty clean... bathroom soap smelled like plumeria from bath  body works nice attention 2 deal there but darn it the waiter missed adding an egg to my over priced burger!.... ordering was a lil confusing in the sense u write what u want or u verbally choose  they write.. small miscommunication my waiter steve left off my egg.... lol i still tipped him though. . 4.00 which made my bill 26.00!!!!
positive: awesome barbers. they take their time and listen to what you want. very laid back and old school atmosphere. great music and sports on all the tvs. negative: time consuming  unprofessional. i have been in about 5 times as a walkin. the wait time is ridiculous. many of the barbers friends come in and will get a cut before unknown walkins. the barbers talk to each other a great deal while cutting which only prolongs the experience. there is no system to keep track of who comes in first unless you call ahead to schedule an appointment. the times i have gone it has taken nearly an hour and a half to get me out of the door and on my way. overall: an excellent shop to go if you have two hours to spare for a simple cut.
their hours were not on the door and the first time i walked in. the guy behind the counter, after i waited at the counter while he was talking to a friend, just turned to me and said oh no were closed and laughed with his friend as if i wasnt there. so after that interaction i tried to come back and they werent open still no obvious hours posted. then after an extensive search online i found their hours which are strange. i finally was able to go when they were open and was able to try the nitro coffee. it was not great and pretty darn expensive. their pastries looked really good and it looks like an okay venue. im trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe ill try again but really not a great impression so far.
i want to love this place! its close to home, the bartender was chill. they have shuffle board, pool and darts!i started with a house salad. it was great. radish, cucumber, croutons, onion. fresh. my only issue was that i ordered a chicken wrap and it literally had about 1oz of chicken. like... diced. next time ill definitely ask for extra chicken because the wraps overall flavor was on point. i also had the asparagus, which i enjoyed. however 7.50 is too pricey. lets be real.i would def come back i just hope the owners read this and make note.
the family and i decided to check this place out. service was expedient and friendly.  loved the hot bar and maybe my palate can handle some heat. the ones with the frownies didnt reflect the grimace.  lol. food was good and priced right.  the kids meals are hearty. all and all we will keep in our rotation.
good food but pricey! upon walking in, i was immediately greeted. the staff here is exceptional! it was my first time dining here as well as my friend. wednesdays are half price with student ids so we jumped in the opportunity. i ordered a chicken quesadilla and a soda. salsa doesnt come with the chips you get with your entree. 7. i asked if that was before or after the discount. it was after. thank goodness we came on wednesday because i couldnt imagine spending 14 on what i got.the food here is pretty solid. the salsa was good. my quesadilla was warm and fresh. the chips were seasoned well. overall, great service and good food. wouldnt return though due to price. the area has so many great alternative options to choose from for a comparable price.
my initial experience here was mediocre... pros open late, clean, good massage chairscons nail technician wasnt very friendly, pedicure was a few dollars more than other places, 20 off all services sign in front was not honored, pedicure chipped within a few daysbecause theyre open late and in my neighborhood i may give them another try, but i wouldnt go out of my way to come here.
i showed up before reading the yelp reviews, around 6 p.m. last friday night. all bbq sold out. i guess this is common from some of the previous posts but i just cant get to a restaurant any earlier because of work. they did have wings left so i ordered them but at 9.00 for one pound i felt they were a bit overpriced and reminded me of the ones i buy at costco in the bag, 5 pounds for around 15.00. i ordered two sides and as mentioned by other reviewers, they were 6 each and very small. they say 1 cup, but seemed smaller to me and the coleslaw was not really even one ample portion, for 6.00 i expect more. staff was disorganized but friendly and i really love the decor, they did a great job. i hope they work out the kinks, i am all for supporting the local family business. if they reevaluate their side portion prices and get it together regarding the running out of their main food it could be good. i will come back in a few months and try again. i am a bit confused though, i thought this store was basically just moving from a scottsdale location where they had been successful so wondering why all the glitches. i hope they work it out.
we decided on eating here on a whim.  the pulled pork was good. the brisket was a little too fatty for my liking. the bbq was good as they offer sweet or spicy.  everything is charged a la carte. the sides are overpriced.  they informed us the dr pepper was not working after we drank the brown soda that didnt taste right. they had a 2 liter sitting on bar instead.  yet they failed to put an out of order sign on fountain.  may never eat here again as not sure if we came at wrong time or wrong day.
bbq is pretty good. the bar has limited options. menu is a little pricey for portion sizes. i got the general feeling that they were feeling out their market before formalizing their menu etc. will return nonetheless
quality of the brisket was disappointing for what we paid. if you like a firmer meat instead of fall off the bone, tear with a spoon texture that imo smoked meat should have, then this is a great place. also, no did between their sweet and spicy sauces.
nothing terribly wrong with this place at all.  but the food is just okay.  it is a little bland.  vanilla as some would say.  and once you factor in their high prices for a casual setting, were down to three stars.  a passing grade, but not worth going out of your way for.
sounds good, but sadly havent tried it, because i have a newborn and they dont take phone orders for pick up. who does that these days, when convenience is paramount?
went last friday for my dads birthday, had a good time.  they only had 3 meats left on the menu for the day so i was disappointed we missed out on the burnt ends.  but the other meats we got were pretty good.  the set up is okay but they dont need to let you know you need to order drinks as well as alcohol when you order your food.  also when they bring your food they should tell you, you need to get your own utensils.  price is okay, hopefully as they are opened longer and if they listen to their reviewers it will only get better.  i think they set their own bars high by handing up all their rewards from frashers steakhouse.  good luck guys ill be back.
i see many improvements in their future since i am sure they are reading these comments.my coworker and i came for dinner one evening and we had these suggestions.1 my coworker wanted real utensils  he was afraid his fork would snap while eating.2 the decor does not seem to match the sitdown food served on plastic plates with plastic forks. i will go to the more casual honey bears for that sort of thing.3 a sampler platter  my coworker wanted to try everything.4 combos5 prices ouch  dinner for two which included 1 beer was 45.6 sign when you come in that says order at the counter then be seated.my coworker and i really enjoyed the food so that is not an issue. the pulled pork was great and my coworker loved the brisket and corn. i was not a big fan of the slaw and felt the bbq beans had more meat than beans. but i will definitely be back and so will my coworker.
went last night for ribs. 1lb of baby back ribs 24  2 medium sides 12  2 medium iced tea...total 44 not too thrilled with this place. first of all, the ribs are just pork ribs  not baby backs. however they did taste pretty good. the sides are mediocre. the decor is like a self service  joint. line up to order, pick your table  they will bring the food. not much table service. my complaints are that it costs way too much for 44 for a rib dinner which doesnt even include sides. ill have better value  services at other restaurants  ie lucilles bbq . probably wont go back again ! disappointed !
my first visit was the other day for lunch and i was so happy with it i bought some for dinner and enjoyed it. however yesterday and pick some up in the evening to bring home for dinner and the brisket was way overcooked. it was gray and dry and tough.
came in for a second try after the first attempt was thwarted when everything was sold out. had visited frashers steakhouse in the past and really enjoyed it. sad to say the new concept just didnt appeal to me. overall my sense was meh. it was not the best, not the worst but meh. could give the benefit of doubt that maybe i just ordered the wrong things always a possibility. wife and i had burnt ends which are usually yummy, tritip platter side of the corn. burnt ends which are an item we would usually really enjoy just seemed bland. no real flavor to it apart from the overall smokeyness of the meat. trip top was about the same, almost seemed like all the juice had been sucked out and both items were just a bit dried out. this place is right in the neighborhood so i am sure we will be back at some point. hopefully it will end with a better experience.
i walked in to frashers really thinking i was going to love my meal. i love their old restaurant and i love good bbq so why wouldnt i love this place? right?!when we placed our order i was happy to see that they had all of their meats in stock the first time we came they were sold out of nearly everything so we left and decided to try another day this was our redo we ordered the rib tip special with corn and the tri tip with fries plus a soda and a beer the total came out to 45 which seemed a little bit on the high side for what we had ordered.the food was fresh and hot when we got it and smelled great. the good the fries and corn were extremely tasty. the less good both the rib tips and brisket seemed kind of dry and flavorless. the true test for me is whether or not i am excited to eat my leftovers the next day for lunch and i hate to say it but i have already made other lunch plans because i have no interest in revisiting last nights leftovers today.i hope to come back and have a better experience. i will update my review if i do.
well...came here when the place i was going to eat at was closed for renovations. i ordered the pulled pork sandwich, fries and the mac n cheese side. went to sit down and wait for my food at a dirty table. it also had an empty roll of paper towels. i wiped the table myself with the last scrap of paper hanging on the roll and waited. food came quickly minus the french fries as they said they were on the way. i lifted the bun and asked the girl where the bbq sauce was after i didnt see anything on the table. she told me it was up in the front. so i walked from the back of the restaurant to the front by the entrance to a table lined up with to go boxes, plastic silverware and bbq sauce squirt bottles. they are marked with a sharpie which flavor they contain. i filled my little plastic cups and headed back to the table. felt very cafeteria! my sandwich was good and the fries once they arrived were also good. the macaroni cheese is terrible. mushy and tastes artificial. dont bother for 3 bucks you get a small side and it tastes bad. all food served in styrofoam, plastic and cardboard. plastic knives and forks too!overall it was okay. the decor was a good attempt but the overall feel is very cafeteria which is emphasized by the lack of real plates and silverware. a long rectangular room with a bunch of booths lined up against the wall. very dark inside due to the edison bulbs used in the fixtures. cool looking but not practical. not sure i will come back. meh....
i enjoyed the food but i am not a bbq expert. i had the chicken which was moist and flavorful and the sandwich serving was a respectable amount of meat. for 8 however, i would have expected a side to be included. my husband had the brisket which was also good but not exceptional. the fries were thick and generous but undercooked. i also tried the green chili mac which was tasty. the assortment of sauces was good too, but not exceptional.the place was quiet at 6:30 on a friday and the service was fast.  my issues with this place started with the price point. for a smokehouse that serves on plasticware , they are a little too proud of the food. my husband and i can get full on brisket and a cocktail apiece for the same 40 at grassroots. the second issue i have is the plasticware. plates and forks as well as styrofoam clamshells for the taking as needed, i cannot fathom the waste. again, for the price point, please lets have silverware instead of piles and piles of plastic in our landfills. im sure its cheaper than paying for a dishwasher and the staff to bus and clear, but if we went back, i would bring a fork from home.
super nice staff, very friendly and informative. the brisket didnt melt in my mouth. meat was so so . mac and cheese and gooey butter cake very yummy
great local, easy to find! this place is close to my house and i drove by it with the intention to go someday. i finally got to check it out yesterday. you order at the counter, menu is pretty straight forward. friendly staff brings your food to your table. they have 3 house made bbq sauces, my favorite was the spicy. least favorite was the sweet tasted like chocolate and that is not the flavor i want on my ribs! yuck! my boyfriend and i shared the baby back ribs and some chicken wings. baby back ribs were ok a little dry and plain for my taste, i had to add a lot of bbq sauce to enjoy. dont get the coleslaw doesnt taste like anything! meat filled chicken wings were excellent, hot sauce was just right! they also came with a generous portion of carrots and celery sticks. i would come back again just to try their sandwiches and to see what the buttery cake dessert is all about...
i originally gave them 2 stars.   giving 4 stars now for their ribs 3 stars overall.  ribs are smoky and have a great bark.  my brisket was dry and not much bark and wasnt good.  i will be back for the ribs for sure.
this is a great place. second time visiting. first time we tried the samosas. they have the appetizer set up so you can sample three different kinds of samosas. girlfriend  and i enjoyed all three. shrimp was really good! perfect spice, really great sauce. get spicy 6!!!!chicken tikka masala is alright. i think the chicken was a bit overcooked on my serving, but sauce was good. tastes good when you combine it with yogurt and garlic naan. dessert is gulab jaman as we always get. they are dough balls drenched in cardamom  syrup. the syrup isnt too sweet like some other indian places we go to. no wonder she likes them  jk.jk..lol  now for service. our server was ok. she seemed new so i gave her a break. she needs to be more aware placement of the plates while she cleared the table. also should watch water glass more closely. had to wait for water from after i finished appetizers to after i finished main course . its ok though because they are a nice staff. overall, definitely coming back to this place for a third time
nice  quite environment. great customer service. need improvement in test. we ordered medium spicy and it seemed like no taste. i would recommend to try once. not sure if ill try second time since i was not impressed with the taste.
the naan was good, but indian main dishes usually have more complex flavors than this place offers. not bad, but nothing special.
aokay, but ordinary selection at 10:30 a.m.plus one star for friendly service.minus one star for some varieties being significantly smaller than the norm.sorry, norm.
nice selection of donuts. good prices. i bought a half dozen to take to work and a couple for my girls and myself. one of my girls wanted the boston cream. as she ate it she kept asking where the filling was. that was a little disappointing. my other daughter had a dozen donut holes. they were light and perfect. i ordered a french cruller and proceeded to pick the bag up from the wrong end and it fell on the floor. my fault. the woman who originally helped me didnt see it happen and i didnt ask for another. i had the other one that was part of my half dozen and it was alright, not amazing. ill probably stop by again since northern perks is on the route i take to drop the kiddos off at school, but i wont go out of my way since rainbow donuts is right down the road.
these donuts are no doubt delicious.i was welcomed to the busy donut shop on saturday morning by two very nice ladies behind the counter. i tell the one who is helping me thats its my first time in, and she hands me a fluffy donuthole. so nice of her! she tells me her husband makes the donuts fresh everyday, they are new to the neighborhood, and that they are having fun with their shop. i like it! picking up two dozen, so i choose the favorites for the first and have her mix up the second. they have prices on the particular donuts that i assume are an additional charge to put in the dozen.  she doesnt advise me of this  i dont ask, but im no newbie to the premium donut world. up charge for the maple bacon, the banana fritter and some others. no problem.the donuts are good! sweet, the icing is legit and flavorful. lots of options here. they have cute pink bakery boxes, but they pack their donuts on their sides. why?! i like pretty and this method smashes the donuts! ordered a cafe du monde for almost 4. it didnt taste great. 2 dozen donuts and a yucky coffee ran me 31. ouch.i would recommend this place for a donut or two but the price is steep to treat the team. my team enjoyed, but i can tell you this place is crossed off the list for the best donuts in cen pho!
this is a soft opening, and it was ok only half the menu was there and they were short staffed.  you could tell because the bartender was working the floor and i believe someone from the kitchen came up for a bit.  i was informed that they hope to be up to full staff and menu options by next friday.  this kind of rush was a bit unexpected for them.might want to give it a until then if youre impatient.  the server was doing her best and so was the person behind the register.  this will be one place ill go back to in about 2 or 3 weeks.  theyll be  ready for the sun prairie crowd by then.  taste wise i had the regular wings, cherry bbq is great, the asian ginger was too gingery for me, but the honey bbq on the boneless wings is good.
we went about a week after opening and they were still getting in the swing of things.  it was a good remodel of the old cousins but it is still a pretty small space which might cause issues for them going forward.  when we arrived it was fairly empty but shortly after we ordered the entire place filled up.  it did not seem like the staff were used to it being busy and service got pretty slow.   the burger was just okay, it didnt stand out much.  the wings are probably the real reason to visit here.  they had had a very good flavor and they have a variety of unusual flavors.  one word of warning about the wings  although they were good the boneless wings were on the small side.
the food was decent, the service needs work. hoping to come back and see some improvements in the service. it was the first week.  they were out of ham and other fixins.
excited to try this new steakhouse in henderson. the decor is beautiful and the service is very polite and attentive. but the food was kind of disappointing. ordered the filet medium and it was still bleeding. sent it back and it was returned still kind of rare. the sides we ordered were the garlic mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach. they were ok not very flavorful.  the manager comped us dessert for the steak mishap. overall i think they are over priced for the amount and quality of the food. i wont go back. sorry but we were disappointed.
kind of expensive. service was good. dont understand why they charge for bread. i didnt like the sweet maple bacon on the wedge said. prefer the wedge salad at brio instead.
a great bar plus great food sums up to a great experience.  larsens is one of those restaurants that caters to budgets or limitless expense.  the service is fantastic, the restaurant is pristine, and the food, great.we started with sweet white wine. it was crisp and so easy to drink. the caramel apple on the label said it all to us. we drank 2 bottles during our meal.we started with artichokes and crab cakes. the crab cakes had a great aioli and good flavor. the artichokes were nicely charred and the aioli was amazing. one of the artichokes had a cold heart but we didnt complain because we had a schedule to keep to get out at a certain time for a movie. still, 2 of the 3 artichoke halves were hot and tasty. my husband and i both had their burger and fries.  the patties were juicy, flavorful, and everything on top of the burger were classic. we figured carryover would cook my burger more, so we ordered medium. it arrived well done. no complaints brought up to thr server since it tasted very good and was still very juicy. its one of those messy eats, which is the way burgers should be. their fries are some of the best ive had. theyre fluffy and crispy, perfectly portioned, and seasoned well. the main course was an overall 3.5.personally, i dont have them on my top 10 as a goto, but i appreciate the great portion sizes and good flavors. dont let my experience sway you not to go. larsens should be one of those must try restaurants because they are more than burgers and artichokes. i say give it a try for what theyre known forsteak.maybe we will go back in 6 months once theyre more settled to try their signature dishes.
udon noodle salad was spicy the meat was super tender and moist. greens were fresh! bacon wrapped shrimp was not the best id had. it disappointingly  tough. im wondering if the bacon should be par cooked before wrapping it around raw shrimp. as crunchy as the bacon was... no wonder the shrimp was like a dry sponge like!
i was taking my wife on a date and saw that larsens grill had some good reviews, so i took her there. the atmosphere was great, the serving staff was alright, and we got our food in a timely manner. the food was very good, my wifes pasta was exceptional and my french dip was a delight the taste of the meat. the one thing that really hindered the overall experience was the amount of fat in my french dip. i tried to work through it as best i could because the meat and bun were so exceptionally good but the fat was out of control. almost every bite i took had at least a quarter size amount of fat. a little fat here and there isnt terrible, but this was a lot of fat. in the end i couldnt finish my sandwich because it just seemed to get worse. i think larsens is worthy of a 4 to 4 and a half stars, but this really set it back. a dinner that i cant finish because of quality makes it a struggle to rate higher. id go back but i wouldnt get the dip again. on another note: why in the world would you not serve the lobster roll on the dinner menu! they said it was a lunch only item but i would have loved to have tried it; if they would have had it available. could have been a easy higher rating!!
my family decided to try larsens to see what it was all about. it is conveniently located in the galleria mall and parking is not an issue. my rating is actually 3.5 stars for the reasons enumerated below. upon arriving we were warmly greeted by a hostess who opened the door and showed us in. we were then seated in a booth. i found the booth to be a bit small and uncomfortable, but then again i wasnt there to spend the evening. our waitress came over and asked us if we were ready to order. i found this a bit odd as we had barely had a chance to sit down and look at the menu. i think she caught her mistake as she quickly asked if we would like to order a drink. we asked for water and she walked off. about three minutes later she returned with three waters and placed them on our table. i told her i would likely order a beer with dinner.  she then asked if we were ready to order and we said we needed a minute, so she asked if we wanted appetizers. we ordered the spinach artichoke dip. the dip arrived in short order and was steaming hot, creamy and delicious although i didnt think there were enough chips as we ran out of chips before we ran out of dip. we were nearly finished with our appetizer when the waitress returned and asked if we were ready to order. i found it odd she did not tell us about the specials but since this was our first time at larsens, i thought perhaps they dont have specials. we ordered prime rib, the burger and hawaiian tritip. as the waitress began to walk off i asked what beer they had on tap as she had apparently forgotten i wanted a beer with dinner. she told me what they had on tap and i asked her about the red ale. she told me she didnt drink beer but could bring me a sample. i agreed. she walked off and about five minutes later brought me a small sampler. i finished the sampler and waited for her to return. my wait was much longer than i anticipated. despite walking past our table several times she never looked at us, asked if we needed anything nor asked about my beer. about 20 minutes later our food arrived and i asked the waitress bringing our food not the same one that had been helping us earlier if i could get a beer. she asked which kind and i told her the red ale that i had sampled. this waitress walked right over to the bar and got my beer. i was a bit surprised that it wasnt the same one i had tasted. i could tell as the beer i sampled was more of a blond ale and the one i ordered for dinner ended up being a dark red ale. both were tasty so i didnt mind it being different, especially as it complimented my prime rib perfectly. as for the food, the prime rib was cooked to perfection and the creamed spinach was creamy, prepared perfectly and served in an attractive dish next to the prime rib. my wife had the ribs with brussels sprouts, the ribs were  tender and prepared properly, although we were a bit surprised that they didnt have more of a teriyaki flavor as they are billed as hawaiian. none the less they were delightful. the brussels sprouts were roasted to perfection and delightfully tasty. our daughter had the burger and it was prepared perfectly as well. she had the homemade macaroni and cheese and felt the use of penne pasta was a fun play on elbow macaroni. while we were eating we overheard a waiter at a different table telling the guests at that table about the specials, i was rather disheartened that we had not been given the opportunity to hear about them. overall the food is fantastic, and the ambiance is a mix between upscale steakhouse and trendy modern hangout.  they have a large selection of wine, although we chose not to have any on this trip. the bar appeared to be well stocked and the selection of draught beers was adequate. the only issue was the waitress on this trip was rather inattentive and appeared that she wasnt really in the mood to be at work. i do understand we all have off days and sometimes were not on our game so i will return here again and im sure next time the service will be as good as the food. as such i give this place 3.5 stars. 5 for food and 2 for service. service truly can make or break a location, even with food as well prepared as this was.
really good service. good solid food. my filet came out more done than i ordered. michael offered to get me another but it was still good! it was crusted with some kind of salty seasoning. came with some baked garlic! the bernaise was a little bland. the artichoke appetizer was good, had a great sauce with it! the drink was good too!
whenever something opens on the east side of las vegas i always like to visit even the chains. ive been here a couple of times and i think its a ok. the staff is nice. they have been short staff both times imo. one person to handle the drive thru and the lobby. bad for business. it takes money to make money. not just selling more but customer service. after my visits ive concluded that i think their smoothies are too sweet. i make smoothies at home and i know it takes a lot of fruit or sweetener to make em sweet. they offer one drink that is naturally sweetened.i do, however, like their food offerings. i think they have a lot of unique or on trend items. korean tacos? thai wraps? it has a little gourmet vibe aka good marketing. i didnt like that their powder tops werent clean. im sure after awhile bacteria will start to form.the place is affordable, clean, and id go back but not in a hurry.
i love tropical smoothie but every time i come here its always understaffed and it takes 1520 minutes for me to get one smoothie. theres always a line, they should hire more than one person!
its a dunkin donuts  im not sure what else to say?!?i was pumped to see this dunkin opening near my house and not on the west side where all of the other new places are opening up in sun prairie right now! they have a drive through and its always quite quick. thumbs up for easy access iced coffee!
ok it is a dunkin doughnuts but the people working here are nice and quick.  i have to have my dd iced tea fix and they had it and it was perfect.  of course the apple fritters and boston cremes are a delight as well but this location is convenient and quick and the people here are pretty efficient.
went here for sunday brunch. a solid brunch place the usual brunch offerings: eggs, crepes, pancakes, french toast, eggs benedict, etc. the fruits are displayed in a very flattering way; i enjoyed the potatoes. the quality and taste are good, but not exceptional.
cluck yeah, fried chicken! the newest spot to hit downtown summerlin features the bromberg brothers take on your favorite fried feathered friend, available in tenders, wings, and sandwiches, with sides, salads, and sodas. thats a lot of alliteration.sandwiches: the classic blue ribbon sandwich is a solid offering with special sauce, while the bluebird kicks it up with blue cheese, red onion, and bacon. the chicken for both was superjuicy without being greasy, but the breading didnt adhere very well and the chicken itself didnt have much flavor. i appreciate that the blue cheese on the bluebird is more of a sauce than crumbles, allowing for more even distribution of flavor.sides: a small is just under 4, while a large is just over 7. steep. mashed potatoes didnt taste instant but also werent worth the price. the small fry is a huge portion of skinnycut seasoned spuds, great for sampling all of their dipping sauces!dipping sauces: brbq bourbontinged barbecue, chipotle honey possibly my favorite, habanero hot is hot, wasabi honey very slight wasabi flavor, and a couple of others. i felt that the sauces were a nice touch, but wish the chicken itself had more flavor. the multitude of sauces seem to be compensating.sodas: their fountain drink station features canesugar sodas. im not generally a soda fan, but there was no button for water so i sampled a few and was surprised to really enjoy them. the ginger ale, creme soda, lemonlime, and black cherry, in that order, were my top picks. there were a few i didnt try.service. heres where im torn on what to rate this place. i understand i went on their second day, but i experienced a few hiccups charged incorrectly, then brought the wrong order. however, management was quick to apologize and fix the issues, and the service from one employee in the dining room in particular was awesome. rounding up for that dude.overall, this spot is a bit overpriced for what you get, but its in downtown summerlin so no ones really surprised. recommend the wing lunchbox combo 5 wings, fries, and a drink for 8 for a better value, only available 113pm, monfri.edit: dropping a star. returned for another visit, still had issues with my order. this time i didnt bother bringing it to their attention. youve been open two months and the kitchen still doesnt know the menu? retrain your staff or hire new people who care.
we got food to go and just to warn you, i dont normally eat fried chicken so i am not the best judge of fried chicken but i know what tastes good to me. what i did like:clean restaurantunique tastecool dipping saucesnot your average fried chickenwings were large, but does that mean pumped with steroids!?!?! kinda scary. what i did not like:high pricesnot many options on the combo fries and coleslaw only?the wasabi honey sauce...too much wasabi eeekkkfor 10 wings and 2 thighs it came out to almost 25. i think that is a lot for what we got. i am open to trying it again and dining in so i can pick what i want. this time my hubby chose what to get.
looking at a number of the other reviews i would say our experience was in line with many of them. ill start with the overall environment, which feels very open and clean for a fast casual place. cleanliness also seemed very positive.for the service, we were pretty pleased. ordering was quick and easy, the remotes that signal when the order is ready worked great. then during the meal staff was very attentive to clear away trash from our table and ask if our needs were being met.as many others have posted i think its the food and value we were most disappointed with. weve enjoyed blue ribbon before, as they run the kitchen at brooklyn bowl, which we really like. unfortunately we ordered the tenders which are not prepared in the same way as the wings and fried chicken, they just didnt have much going for them other than being piping hot! looking around the room we immediately wished we had gone for the wings or actual fried chicken, it looked pretty good. we tried two sides, fries and corn. the fries were perfectly acceptable and a small fed two adults plus a toddler. the corn was a little watery and too reminiscent of something right from the can...with a little seasoning added. finally on the value front, id agree with many reviewers in that i was a little surprised by the overall price point for what you get. its not way out of whack, but running a little high.well probably try again and definitely skip the tenders, it is great to have another option in the neighborhood.ps  big fan of the habanero hot sauce!
i was very excited to see a new fried chicken joint opening up in town and quickly went there to check it out only to be underwhelmed by the quality of food and portions you get for the cost. you get a 3 piece or a 5 piece tender combo for like 14! that seems pretty crazy price wise for me, and the price for the sides was also ridiculous. we ordered two orders of chicken tenders and got a side of mashed potatoes and i cant say any of it was bad, just not great especially for how much you are spending on them. wish the portion was right for the price. all the staff were very nice and helpful and i did love the space that its located in, very industrial but open and clean.
this is probably the 4th or 5th time i eat take out from this place. i always have their tender supreme meal, corn, mash,  collard greens. the tenders are well seasoned, not too much or too little. mine are always moist  fresh. their fries are alright. their corn is good, so are their collards and mash. overall, its not something i absolutely have to have  i feel they are overpriced though. just my opinion!
i was excited to try this new place in downtown summerlin the restaurant was clean and visually appealing. the staff was competent especially the bussers. the food was well....ok. i thought it was overly expensive and i didnt love the seasoning on the chicken. it was edible but not anything i will be rushing back for.
food was hot and fresh, the dry rub seasoning on the chicken does take a bit to get used to. the portions are good sized. three stars are solely because the seasoning is not to my taste. staff is friendly. the restaurant is clean and has several tvs to watch. the drink fountain is not your typical  cane sugar drinks. again takes a bit of getting used to.  i had the ginger ale  tasty, but took a bit to get used tothe place is more expensive than expected. maybe because its summerlin? three piece with a drink , including their string fries these were very good and plentiful was about 12.
its good. fries were too salty. the chicken was hot and juicy but too much of the seasoning for me. great service though.
unfortunately i have to agree with some of the reviewers who felt that the prices  are a little high for the type and quality of the food. i understand that being in downtown summerlin has something to do with it, but its still hard for me to stomach paying 14 for two pieces of chicken tenders, fries, and drink.
unfortunately the reviews are right, this place is a bit underwhelming. my friend came here a few weeks ago and despite the mixed reviews, the pictures looked pretty delicious so i had to try it out for myself. i came here this past sunday and ordered the 2 boneless thighs meal which also came with shoestring fries and coleslaw. at first the pieces of chicken looked ginormous, but as i started eating i could tell the chicken was flattened and it consisted of mainly breading. the breading was good, but i thought it was kind of inconsistent considering the color of the seasoning was darker it some parts than in others. is that suppose to be like that or are they still trying to get the grove of making this chicken since they are still fairly new? the coleslaw was pretty standard so that was good. i do like shoestring fries and they did a pretty good good. just as another review said the sauces were nothing spectacular, but when youre here for the first time you feel obliged to try them. although i did like the hot sauce and used that the most, actually it was hot at all but did add extra flavor when i dipped the chicken into it. the inside is nice and is your modern take on countryfarm like. they keep this place clean and the service was good considering an employee stopped by our table and offered to refill my drink. to save money because their prices are kind of ridiculous  i just had a water, but their fountain drinks and ice teas werent from your typical major soda beverage supplier. i think i will be back but only for the lunch special for 8 because i think thats more of an accurate price for the food.
we drove by a few times and felt intrigued to give it a try. the atmosphere is nice, clean. staff was friendly. particularly the busboy. i watched as he diligently worked the floor, made sure the customers had everything they needed and even stopped them from bringing their own trays to the trash. he seemed very thoughtful and even offered us some extra ranch as soon as our food was ready. theyre lucky to have him!the food was okay. original, yes. the dryrubbed chicken almost had that homemade touch to it and the fries were really good. i think where this place lacks is a signature sauce. while it offered plenty of chipotlesomething, honeysomething and bbq.. it wasnt anything extraordinary or different from store bought. i felt it needed something else. it would have been okay except for the fact that for two adults, the tab was almost 30 bucks. we each had 3 pieces of chicken, fries and a drink. 30 bucks felt a bit steep for the meal. i felt for what we paid.. it just didnt match the price. same thing at caines wouldve been half the cost and i wouldnt gotten their garlic bread. i do think its a good addition to downtown summerlin and will fit in well with the demographic. good, but not for me.
the fried chicken and fries were pretty good. the place was very clean. but the explicit, blaring rap music was terrible. how do u play music with bitch, n, s and the f bomb in a public restaurant?if i do come back,it will be to go.
gave it 3 stars because i wasnt too impressed. the food was pretty good but came out just warm not hot. i mainly wanted to come here to eat the smorgasbird a double decker chicken sandwich with basically every topping they have haha.i got a side of loaded large fries, the staff was really friendly but i just thought the food would be better.
the service buoyed my rating to a three as everyone was very friendly and helpful. food though was just so so. the breading is the same for all the chicken with lots of paprika, chili, and others spices except salt. the breading itself is not super crispy which in by book is a minus. the slaw was a bit dry. i did think the fries were good though. they are a shoestring cut. the price totaled over 32 for lunch which was fairly pricey however the potions were huge and we could have gotten by with sharing one meal which would have made it reasonable. i agree with others, raising canes is much better.
i just tried the chicken sandwich thats all i could afford for lunch: its was about 8 no drink no side of fries or coleslaw: just the chicken sandwich, it was good i tried all the sauces love honey on my chicken! but so sad thats its too expensive, i saw they have a two piece that comes with fries and a coleslaw for 9.75 no drink, i wasnt willing to spend that much on lunch :, place was clean and the service is good. its just a bit pricey.
first things first it is expensive fried chicken.  my friend and i ordered the two chicken tender combo upgraded fries to be loaded and the bbq chicken sandwich.  our bill totaled around 25, which is ridiculous.  our food was good, but not 25 good.  the chicken is juicy and flavorful, but my tenders were a little chewy.  the fries are pretty good, but not really worth the 2 upgrade for loaded fries.  if you care, the bacon they use is much better quality than fast food restaurants!  probably could have used more cheese, though.the sandwich has their fried chicken, cheese, bacon, and sauce pretty standard.  the bun is super soft, which i think rounds out the sandwich and makes up for the price around eight bucks.  i added just a little more bbq sauce because i like a messy bbq sandwich.  this is what i would order if i returned.i love the soda options mmm... creme soda! but again, expensive!!!long story short: way too expensive to frequently visit, but the chicken sandwich i had was great.  i would visit again if a friend really wanted to go because they hadnt visited yet.
i stopped into blue ribbon fried chicken after a few drinks at downtown summerlin. lets just start with that it is extremely modern inside. however, i then saw the prices. the food is way overpriced, even for the area. i paid 12 for a sandwich. it came with sides, but that did not come with a drink. the portions are average. youre not paying for more. overall, the food was okay. it wasnt at the mcdonalds level. but, it was not something that i would keep coming back for. service saved this review.
spending 43 for chicken fingers, a chicken sandwich and a couple of beers youd expect a bit more.  it wasnt bad, but nothing to write home about. staff was friendly. definitely a one and done.
tasty fries, but a serious lack of seasoning or any flavor in the chicken. the homemade pickles helped, but not enough. hush puppies were slightly over cooked which led to them being a little dry, but had a nice oniony flavor. chicken on the bone had better seasoning. cole slaw was nice with a vinegary tang. i wanted to like this place. hopefully they will find some salt.
sadly i have to say, dont waste your time eating here. i appreciate good fried chicken and french fries are my life, but this place did not satisfy my taste buds at all. everything here is seasoned with this seasoning that just tasted funky to me. i was not able to eat the battered skin of my chicken because of it. the chicken itself was moist, the flavor just didnt do it justice. i had the gravy fries, which sounded delicious, but again it had that weird seasoning and the gravy was not good either. upon sitting at the table, the sauces available made me excited, but after tasting it, i could not find a sauce that suited me. the food here just didnt meet my expectations. i drove across town to try this place, but i would not go back. beyond all the negativity about their food, there was one specific waiter walking around the dining area who was great at his job. he was very attentive to the customers, quick on his feet and he is very friendly.
i think overall it was really nice however the price is very high and took a long time to get our food. i also recommend taking out to eat because it is a bit crowded. as for the flavor of the chicken was not bad it was actually pretty good. i liked all the sauces. a tip is to ask for their buffalo sauce now that is good. great table service they did bring our meal to the table and did ask us if we wanted refills of water. will probably not be back due to the price.
soooo ive been wanting to try this place for awhile now. you know me and fried chickenfrench fries. there was no better opportunity then when i was shopping at downtown summerlin with my family. we walked in and i thought it would be packed at 11:45 am. there was no one there and i wasnt sure if it was even opened until i tried the door. i decided to try the tenders with the loaded fries. one star for their sauces...i think its a great idea to have a variety of sauces like they do and they have a to go station where people can take sauces home in small containers. another star for their service. i had my two kids and they brought out everything to me and even asked me if i wanted ranch. another star for the food being just ok. the tenders were not tasty at all without the sauces and even then it was a bit bland. the tenders were seasoned unevenly and my tot wouldnt even eat it. however, the fries were good. i actually liked the regular fries over the loaded fries surprisingly. i definitely want to try a sandwich and see what happens next time.
the service was outstanding. ..the food is way overpriced for wings is what we ordered. ..sorry to say, it is going to be impossible to stay afloat in vegas for wings n things with those ridiculous prices. who wants to pay that much for junk food. if you want to save your business i would suggest a price adjustment otherwise you will be disappointed very quickly.
good chicken, great fries and huge portions for modest prices make this worth another visit. the fries were the best part of my meal, which shouldnt be the case for a restaurant with chicken in the name. the chicken was cooked well, but not a lot of flavor. it looked seasoned and smelled seasoned, but i couldnt taste much seasoning in the breading. the chicken itself was good though. there were honey and sauces to add some flavor, but i didnt love any of them. id eat here again, but it might not be my first choice for a meal.
decided to try this place since ive heard a lot of hype about it.  honestly it was decent but nothing mind blowing.  not sure if i would be back since there is shake shack as another option a across the street. but i will say im glad we tried and its worth a try but not running or craving to go back.  service was good.  place is clean and staff is friendly. food is just ok for me.  gravy fries were 45 and was worth the calories. adobo corn 35 something different but nothing special. kerrys classic 3.55 enjoyed the sweet bun.  i did add the wasabi honey which i loved.  overall if im going to blow my calories for a cheat meal there are better options in the area. solid 3.55 for me but make your own judgement and try for yourself.
it was a hit and miss. the chicken tenders were fresh and crispy but the spices were a bit bland. however the homemade ranch sauce and other dipping sauce was great.  my sister had the kerrys classic chicken sandwich said it was fresh but didnt like the flavor of the sauce. fries were seasoned, hot and fresh but probably wouldve been better if we made it into nacho or gravy fries. but what really stood out was the great customer service we experienced. during our meal a few of the severs came around to check on us and ask if we needed anything else. the place was clean and organized with huge windows that are great for people watching. will be back to give this place a second chance.
having a hard time loving this place, been here three times and still cant make this a go to place for fried chicken since my son loves his chicken strips. the problem is with the spice that they have on their batter too much for my taste, some people may like it, but i dont really care for it. the last time we were here we had the chicken burger with blue cheese dressing, chicken wings lunch pack, tender supreme 3 strips with fries and milkshakes. the shakes were definitely too sweet and it came in a pretty small size. i really like their french fries and the nice clean environment, the service was also very good and accommodating. lunch for the three of us came to over 50.
decided to try this place because ive been to all of the other restaurants in downtown summerlin. it took about 20 minutes to get the food which is pretty long for a fast food place. i ordered the blue ribbon sandwich and my mom ordered the 2 tender combo which comes with fries and cole slaw. when we got the food i was really surprised by the heavily seasoned chicken. very strong seasoning on it was like a cajun seasoning but i did not like it at all. neither did my mother. the fries however were really good. but the cole slaw was bland. i wouldnt recommend this place. if your in the area try shake shack which is directly across the street.
dinos is the new italian restaurant that replaced belfiores. after being closed for renovation for over a year, they have opened but under new ownership. the new restaurant has many upgrades that were needed while under belfiores ownership. the front pizza and bakery section is upgraded with all new coolers for the pastries, cold cuts and pizza. new granite countertops were also installed. the formal dining area no longer has the small tacky bar in the back corner. they added a two server stations in the dining area.since they opened a few days ago, there are still things that are not fully complete or operational in the restaurant, making this restaurant clearly not ready to serve customers. upon entering there was not one morsel of food anywhere in the restaurant to be seen. there was not one pastry in the cold case, not one pizza or any slices on the counter to choose from, not one loaf of bread etc...the only thing that were there, food wise, was one log of boars head ham. on the wall by the pastry cases, they seem to have installed an entire wall that is a chalk board. they have welcome to dinos written in chalk in very poor handwriting. personally, restaurant i would have hired a professional artist to do some type of chalkboard drawing to make it look at least halfway decent.upon walking in, we asked the counter woman we can sit in the luncheon section and order slices. she made a comment about sitting in the dining area. i said no, i wanted to sit in the casual side since we were ordering slices. we sat us in the formal area, for tipping purposes i assume. come to find out they have zero, not one slice of pizza made. how can you be a new pizza restaurant and have no pizza made? we sat in the formal area and ordered a 16 pie. the pizza arrived and the first thing i noticed was the color of the crust. it had the color and texture of sourdough, although i didnt think it was. the pizza did not have pizza sauce on it. it was made with marinara sauce. theres a big difference between the two. i didnt make it taste bad but it would have been better being made the way it is supposed to be. the crust was very crispy. the server cut the pizza before bringing it out. she cut it into about 18 peices. i dont know why she had to cut it into so many peices. there were only 3 of us dining. overall, for the pizza, ill give it a 4 or 5 out of a 10. i am extremely critical. if someone eats it who doesnt know good pizza and ingredients,  theyll probably rate it at an 8. the tacky hand painted murals that belfiore had on the walls are now gone but dinos replaced them with their own version but theyre hand painted pictures of people in a gondola. as a restaurant customer, id rather look at a nice pattern or actual pictures besides an amateur artists painting of an italian man in a gondola who appears to be a cross between african american and mexican with a polish nose. the server informed me that they dont even have a pastry baker yet and they cant find one. they also have no one to make pizza yet. how can you officially open with no food to display or anyone to make it?!? that right there shows very very poor management and ownershiptotal experience: 4 out of 10 stars. maybe once they get their act together and open their doors with their ts crossed and their is dotted, ill give them another shot. until then, im not returning to a restaurant which shouldnt be open yet.
my second time, and might be my last.  first time they were only open a couple weeks.  i was the only person in the place and wasnt greeted when i came in. i ordered a slice to dine in.  the employee couldnt have looked less interested in waiting on me.  i almost didnt ask about the baked goods but i wanted a cookie.  she didnt know anything that was in the cases.  i sat down and when she brought my pizza she basically threw it on the table without a word. the pizza was slightly above average as was the tiramisu cookie... so i tried again today.  very friendly server, but a bit overwhelmed.  i needed 4 cookies and a slice to go.  20 minutes later, its ready, but 2 of the cookies are wrong.  okay, maybe i miscommunicated so i wanted to buy the other 2 cookies for my friends and the server who is overwhelmed 1 table was leaving with 2 ladies and a single person came in for a slice told me that the owner would take care of me. i stood at the bakery case for another 5 minutes.  the owner was discussing advertising with 2 gentlemen, so i dont know if he knew i was waiting, but 25 minutes is a little excessive for a quick to go order, so i left.  there are a lot of pizza places that are comparable or better and i can sacrifice having a cookie.  customer service is important to me and the main reason i am a repeat customer.  talked to people in the nail salon in the same complex and they said my experience is similar to others they have heard.  cant say id recommend this place to friends and family based on my two visits.
i have to say i was really excited to try dinos for my first time and was a little disappointed. the food was amazing, but the salad was such a small portion for a pretty expensive price of the meal and my toddlers drink was 2.50 for the smallest glass of lemonade. i think the one thing that could really make this place even better is friendlier waitresses. the service i had was soso, and he actually argued with me telling me i didnt order something that i did. im a server as well, so i try to give other servers the benefit of the doubt but this is something that should never happen. all together, i had an okay experience and probably will return.
this was the first time i needed to wait at the service department while getting the oil changed. first off, it was not easy to make the appointment. ill give them that i called on the friday before the holiday weekend, but i kept getting rang back to the operator. same saturday, and apparently there was only one person there who can schedule appointments. so i waited until tuesday, and got the same run around. i ended up making the appointment online, which in the end proved to be the fastest way because i actually got a call back within a couple of hours. who knew? the service department itself is a nice set up like a mini town where you can pretty much have anything done to yourself while you wait short of plastic surgery. were really only going here because we have the free services another year. but the mini town in the dealership could be just enough to keep me coming back even when i have to pay.
wow, what happened here? how can you open a store like this and then have it fail so quickly? i guess someone at corporate didnt do their demographic research? this store had such great potential. darn, now im stuck either going to walmart wall of people, or smiths which has become a major zoo. what to do when you are in search of non gmo foods?
as with their takeover of what is now hemma edinburghs swedish pub owners have another sterile, modern establishment on their hands here and are doing their best to soften its edges and make it a comfier beast than when it housed the hole that was cargo.on the brief evidence afforded by a visit for a cup of tea and cake earlier this week it seems they are succeeding. service was good, if a little swift at the table clearing we had a mouthful of brownie keft on the plate as it was whisked away and the various seating options mostly seemed comfy although we never looked upstairs.as the nearest cafe competition closes at 5pm and with two large festival productions going on along the road in the coming month akva could well be on t o a very profitable thing.
plus side:1. wheelchair accessible from the beer garden side and wheelchair access for the bathroom.2. they reserved us a table for a birthday outing3. great haloumi salad  veggie options.point deducted for:1. painfully slow food service, about an hour for 7 meals. 2. bar staff mixing up orders adding a wedge of lime into my husbands cognac instead of my rum??3. the humous was so garlicky that it was burning in the mouth.
akva hasnt been open that long but long enough that the service should be better than it is. the food was good and arrived in good time. the menu is similar to the other boda bar pubs and caters well for vegetarians, vegans and a few gluten free options. the service wasnt especially bad just slow and a not enough checking back or opportunities to order additional drinks etc. the acoustics of the bar arent that great so its quite noisy especially with music being played and at times i felt i had to shout to be heard at the other side of the table.
four of us met for brunch this morning so we could have some of the breakfast menu and some of the lunch menu.  items ordered were:chocolate nutella pancakeschallah french toastchicken and wafflefat irish green house made corned beef hash.monte cristo sandwichmiami cuban sandwichpulled pork sandwichchicken pot pieeggplant parmigianameatballsbread puddingcaramel turtle piethis is a 3 star restaurant working on it s fourth star.  as siegels 1941 has only recently opened, there are bound to be a few kinks but the restaurant is a solid place to eat.  the restaurant has been completely renovated from when it was the steakhouse for the el cortez.  i was sorry to see that go, but i was happy to see what they did for a replacement.  while more open and more open to the casino than the former steakhouse, im glad to see how theyve given honors to benjamin siegel for when he had partial ownership of the el cortez.  also prominent in the decorations are photos of his girlfriend virginia hill.now the food.  the restaurant did a better job with the savory dishes than the sweet breakfast ones.  the cuban, monte cristo, corned beef hash, and chicken pot pie were the standouts of the savory items.  the chicken and waffle was good as was the french toast.  the chocolate nutella pancakes were a disappointment.  i expected something more than sloshing on some nutella on top of pancakes.  there were a few glitches in the kitchen.  we ordered eggplant parmigiana but got chicken parmigiana.  we also ordered just meatballs but we got spaghetti and meatballs.  these are the issue which need to be worked out.our server, claudia, did an outstanding job.  she almost singlehandedly served the food to this hungry foursome.  id return for the corned beef hash if for breakfast and i will definitely return for the chicken pot pie.  i cannot give that high enough praise.thanks to mr. farber for stopping by to check on us and see that all was well.  when they get some of their newness worked out, this can be a 4 star restaurant.
tonight we had the opportunity to dine in a recent newly opened 24 hour restaurant at the el cortez that was named after one time owner benjamin bugsy siegel. the restaurant achieved the blessing and cooperation of siegels daughter who was a teenager at the time of his assassination in 1947. she donated some family photos and even 8mm video of her father and family. in premise, backstory, and even aesthetic execution, i would give this place 55. unfortunately, the ultimate execution falls short on a few levels. yelp has this restaurant categorized as a steakhouse but the truth is it it just one step above a 24 hour coffee shop. the restaurant is located in the former space that was occupied by the el cortez steakhouse which was a fine dining old vegas style restaurant. siegels isnt really a steakhouse at all. it offers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night with a menu that includes low priced sandwiches, appetizers, and basic steaks and soups. we ordered the calamari which was ok to mediocre. the poutin was a travesty. had it not been labeled as poutin and instead just advertised as cheese fries, we would have probably been more impressed. the overall restaurant is quite nice. my recommendation would be to nix the 24 hour and go for a more traditional darker siegel steakhouse fine dining restaurant. the concept is done nicely with napkins, china, and mosaics all adorned with their siegels 1941 logo done in bugsys handwriting. i do recommend giving it a try but i also recommend that they revamp their overall structure. service was satisfactory. not great but not bad either. just mediocre to okay. i think this restaurant, now a month old, will reinvent itself eventually and when it does, i look forward to returning.
the prime rib was so bad, salad tasted like it was tossed in chemicals, spinach tasted like the color green out of a can, but the basic stuff like chicken wings and fries are good. i think its an overpriced cafe trying to be a fancy restaurant. the employees were really nice.
on my recent trip i had great expectations of the renovations at my favorite las vegas casino!  i would rate 2 12 stars if possible, the service and overall staffing seemed to lack organization, the hostesses were great during the mid morning however the dinner hours they did not have a smile or great me.  it was strange to be asked to sit while waiting for a table when more then 34 of the seating was available on my first night there.  the food wasnt what i expected as the cafe cortez was always a sure thing the waitresses and bus service was 5050 either very good or very bad!  i hope when i return on my next visit they have regrouped and have the quality of food and service we regulars are accustomed to.  ending on a positive the ahi tuna was one of the best i have ever had, the prime rib was also very good and the french dip sandwich was as usual great!!!
ordered the crab cakes which were average flavor but small.  everyone enjoyed their meal, prices were decent.
ahhhh, vegas.while playing some video poker and waiting for some friends to arrive at the el cortez bar, i noticed an advertisement for their restaurant, siegels 1941. the deal being offered was las vegas at its finest and i couldnt get it out of my mind. starting at 11pm you can grab yourself an el cortez burger and a beer for 6.00. my interest was peaked and you can bet your big ol butt that i was in the half empty restaurant, waiting to be seated and hungry as all hell at a few minutes past 11pm. okay, the service is horrid. one waitress, spread super thin, completely frustrated and ready to clock out... for life. she puts a lot of trust that the menu does a good enough job explaining the food because when shes at your table, shes all biz, no chitchat. thankfully i was already prepped and primed for the burgerbeer special, which was not listed anywhere inside of the restaurant but verified to actually exist. i ordered mine cooked medium with a ice cold pbr to wash it all down. twenty minutes later an impressive looking burger surfaced and i was quick to dig in. wheres the salt? wheres the pepper? sure it was cooked to the perfect temperature and looked pretty, but damn, wheres the flavor? a little seasoning could have bumped this burger up a few levels seeing as all of the other components were pretty decent. hey, for 6.00 ill still chalk this one up as a win.
there were a few glitches with the hostess... i called ahead and made a reservation, but our table wasnt ready when we arrived.  i had also asked for a table that would handle a wheelchair, but the hostess set us up toward the back and had us navigate through the other patrons.  the restaurant itself is very nice looking, especially the bugsy memorabilia and tin ceiling.  one hotelcasino issue is that there are no family restrooms nearby, and the womens room handicapped stall was broken  we have a fulltime female nurse with us for my father, so this made it difficult for him to use the facilities.food : both of the steaks we ordered were lukewarm on arrival.  after heating, both were quite tasty.  the matzo ball soup was very salty and the challah served with the soup was dry.  nice side salad, good penne vodka, good garlic bread.  the salmon a top of the caesar salad was delicious.most of these issues were handled and somewhat erased by the sweetness of our server, linda.  she is a treasure!  all in all, siegels 1941 has good bones  hopefully, will only get better.
my friends and i came here for the awesomely cheap prime rib special. we walk through downtown lv from our hotel which was at the other end of the downtown area and once we get there, the rudest hostess tells us that we cant come in and sit because we arent wearing a shirt with sleeves. are you kidding me?! this place is located in downtown las vegas that serves a 11 prime rib special. its not like its a 5 star restaurant.anyways, we ended up buying shirts next door and came back since we had walked for 30 mins to get there. when we finally got seated, we looked around and saw people in flip flops and cargo shorts. classy stuff right there.the best part of our experience was our server. she was so nice and sweet and she even apologized for the rude hostess. she saved the experience for us. we ended up ordering the prime rib special which comes with a baked potato, but our server let us switch it for mashed potatoes. the food itself was nothing special. my stab of meat was overcooked even though i asked for rare and my boyfriend ordered medium and it came out medium rare, so we switched. maybe when they dropped it off they announced it wrong, but if you used your eyes then you could clearly see that it was wrong. not really sure if we would come back here again because the food wasnt so great and pretty out of the way.
midcentury modern light fixtures, rich red leather booths, dimmed lighting, and televisions showing classic black and white films from the 40s and 50s siegels tries and mostly succeeds at establishing a classy retro atmosphere. the menu encompasses breakfast and dinner specials, a series of sandwiches of the world, and a 19.41 steak dinner, which makes siegels not what i expected. the atmosphere is geared more toward a steakhouse, but is instead utilized as a diner. the 19.41 steak dinner includes a salad heads up, the house vinaigrette is a creamy version, sliced sirloin served topped with steak sauce usually not  something i like, but nicely zesty here,  heap of fresh fries, and a bread plate which never materialized. the tuesday dinner special is a countryfried steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables, which was generously sized and solid for the low 11 price tag. we couldnt resist adding on a bowl of their matzoh ball soup with challah, which was surprisingly meaty for 8. we wanted to share a dessert, but upon asking to see the menu, we were handed our bill guess that makes the decision for us, huh?unfortunately, the subpar service kind of ruined it for me. regulars were enthusiastically greeted, and we were helped in a polite and competent manner, but odd delays 20 minutes between courses, 10 to run our card, the dessert thing made things a bit frustrating. the location and decor lend this space the potential to be a higherend restaurant, if they kicked up the menu and retrained the staff.
some of these treats are tasty.  however, the dough is somewhat uncooked which produces a sticky, doughy texture.  in any case, these tasty, doughy delights come at a steep price!  for one classic donut be prepared to dish out a little less than 2.00 including tax.  if south scottsdale is serving donuts at these outlandish prices, then gentrification is knocking hard and fast.  clearly the owners are catering to a limited demographic.  if you want to stay in business, keep in mind the average, hardworking customers paycheck in mind.  not all of us are trustfund millennials.62815 update: went back for the free donut offering, which is a sign of a good business considering they are conscious of keeping their customers happy.  they did fix their dough issue it seems.  im assuming this may have been due to equipment malfunction during their opening week?  in any case, their newly fixed donut machines are producing a distinct taste and it has definitely improved the quality of their donuts.  theres always room for improvement, hence the 3 stars instead of 2.  if they can work with prices, or offer a stamp card program then i may boast their ratings. these are supposed to be gourmet donuts, i.e., not your typical cheaply made grocery store donuts, so expect to pay premium prices.
i was here earlier in the week and have mixed feelings.  i ordered a glazed old fashioned and a chocolate glazed and when i got home found two glazed old fashioned in my bag.  the first one was absolutely delicious and the second one was wet in the middle.  not sure if it was undercooked or saturated with the glaze?also, i wanted a simple cup of drip coffee but they dont do this and offered me an americano or latte instead which i declined.
i didnt read any reviews before i stopped in. i consider myself a pretty decent donut connoisseur. i am probably the only one that doesnt have bosa in his top five in the valley. that being said i love donuts and can usually find moment to pen a good review about a pastry shop...i am not sure what happened here. the door opened and it looked dark inside so i sat in my car making sure something wasnt going down inside. once in i thought the decor was pretty right on for what i saw on the outside. just not what i expected. i bought a dozen donuts for a group and to get a variety of ones to try since, hello i like fing donuts! the strawberry cheesecake werent ready yet when i came in so i opted for other varieties. appearancewise they look fantastic. i busted out the key lime donut and dug the flavor of the topping but man that dough just needs a little work. it was a very chewy consistency and very dense. i like a heavy donut being that a dunkin donut not even close to a top ten is so damn fluffy it is barley there but, this just is like chewing gum. now dont get me wrong, the location, the concept, the flavored are really good but a little more attention to the donut itself and you will kill it. this appears as if someone went ready...fire...aim! as a good friend of mine put it so eloquently. i have made my own donuts and it takes some work to get consistency down on a recipe. what do i know though? im just a dude bitching about donuts. i really like the joint and would love to come back and see what improvements you can make.  to coming to the neighborhood.
great potential but needs some work. the flavors choices and the decor is very hipi could see this becoming a fun neighborhood spot. cool to have the fancy coffee, but regular coffee would be a great option. maybe since their all about local they could work with cartel coffee?on to the donuts. glazes first:maple bacon: delicious, perfect balance of sweet and saltysamoa: really not too special. more like a chocolate donutneeded more coconut flavor. my hubby thought it to be too chocolateyprickly pear: great flavor, i kinda wished this was a filled donutchocolate glazedoverwhelmingly chocolate, good but not what i expected. more of a ganache than icingdonut:overall the donut had the appearance of being fluffy, but was chewy and dense. they are not meltinyour mouth, and eating two of them feels like a brick in your stomach.i like this place but i think they should fix their dough. as it is now its not a light fluffy donut that you could eat week to week, but more of a specialty place like voodoo donuts.
went back and most of the problems were fixed. flavors of the donuts were great. the dough is still a little chewy and dense. but i would go back. a good donut and very friendly people.
a very considerate reply by the business staff was made to this review. i have adjusted my rating  based on this information and appreciate the overall intention.im super sad to leave this review because i had high expectations for born and glazed. i follow them on instagram im an avid supporter of family owned and anything local. i will always choose local businesses over chains. most all local supporters have passion and love for what they create and sell, and i want those business to stay supported so they inturn can continue to support other local businesses.i did not see any of that passion today.i drove nearly 15 miles from ahwatukee to visit born and glazed. being as it was my first visit, i was excited to learn about their amazing looking creations. when i mentioned that it was my first time in, the man working the counter didnt even reply or give a smile. he just asked what he could get me, but i wanted to know what was popular or just get a feel for what was offered in the two cases. there were only 9 different kinds  its not like i was asking him to describe 20 flavors. when i asked him what selections were in front of me, he seemed uninterested and only gave me the description of one doughnut. i further had to point out specific doughnuts and ask what they were to get him to talk. he mentioned that they are crazy busy on the weekends and sold out of a lot early in the mornings. i said oh, well that great to be busy!but again, no response. he lacked any passion in what born and glazed should represent and didnt care about taking a little extra time with a first time customer to make sure they would leave happy and return. i left feeling bummed that i just paid almost 10 he didnt even have the full correct change to give me for 12 dozen doughnuts that i was bringing to my coworkers and sadly wouldnt be able to tell them much of anything good about why they should check this place out.
prickly. pear. donut. shaped like a cactus?!! absolutely... sign me up. but,the other donuts are just donuts. the texture, especially first thing in the morning, is pretty near perfect from what ive had but the overall flavor lacks. ive stopped for work quite a few times and theyve been great about making it work for me. the coffee is good, strong and robust. and i like the house made flavored.biggest complaint? the lack of life in the place. it might be the location since it looks like its in a long forgotten strip mall. and the prices are high for what it is. its become the place i stop at to get out of towners a cactus donut in true wild west form. thats about it. it has potential though, so dont write it off. and definitely come and try the prickly pear.
i finally stopped by here on my way home to pick up a few items i had avoided it previously because i heard it was too pricey. to be honest, i found hardly any difference between haggen and vons.   the produce department looks a little improved but other than that  minimal difference except one thing, it is a little more pricey but not by much.as far as the staff, they were the same faces i saw at vons so if you liked them at vons, you will like them here.  i like them just fine i have no benchmark against others hagens but i did try alberstons  few times recently and these folks appeared to have lower prices than albertsons.   as far as grocery stores go in the area, the last year or so, i have done all of my regular shopping at smiths on rampsrt but this place would be ok for a stop on the way home for me.  no issues
ive been in haggens twice, and so far theyre only middle of the road. my first visit i would have rated them 4 because the produce department has an impressive selection of good produce. my second visit they rate a 2. their freshbaked bread was very hard on top and their deli is lacking in cheese. there was a variety of deli meats, no problem there. but wheres the cheese? there were only signs for four types of cheese and zero blocks on display. but its a large grocery store deli, they gotta have cheese, right? i ask for a half pound of provolone and the employee reaches into the case where theres a small saran  wrapped package of cheese. he tells me this is all the provolone he has and weighs it. its .45lb so i say close enough, but i ask him wheres all the cheese? hes apologetic but all he can say is this is all they have. if the cheese truck broke down or the cheese cooler died, hed have said something, right? okay so, the only other cheese i can see is one small package of maybe swiss. so, every other deli customer for the rest of the day or until whenever they find a couple of blocks of cheese was s.o.l., other than that one lucky guy who only wants a small packet of swiss. go to the prepackaged dairy section? go to another store is more likely. i have to agree with another reviewer who said something along the lines of, this store says theyve been in business for 80 years, they should be a little more together than this. ps haggens  dont let the 3 stars swell your head, i wouldve given you a 2.5 if i had the option. but dont worry, ill be back. i have to see how this ration on cheese plays out.
i love all the great new restaurants popping up in this part of town! stopped in on opening day for a poboy and was pleasantly surprised by the moderncountry interior. the colorful stickon letters for the menu and signage felt a little cheap, wonder if theyre still waiting on more permanent signage?in any case, service was polite and suggested the shrimp poboy or their daily special todays was turkey, ham, and brisket all sides are extra and sandwiches range from about 1013. large sandwich easily feeds two, and the meats tasted freshcut, but the bread was ridiculously dry and falling apart. wish id opted for the classic shrimp or debris version, as the special lacked any sort of cajun sauce or louisiana pizazz. next time ill have to add on a side of gumbo or cajun fries. sides are a bit pricey and sandwiches are huge, not a great place to fly solo.
prices are high, and sand which was a little dry. still an awesome concept for downtown. the fry basket is huge. had the shrimp po boy and friend had the cat fish. maybe specials would be a good idea.
after going downtown for another restaurant for lunch i ended up here other place doesnt say when it closes so id already paid for parking when they were closed at 415pm on saturday: apparently dtp restaurants are hit or miss across the boardzydeco was good but room for improvement agree with reviews of the place and chefs charm, also that pricing and portions are substandard for vegas however that seems to be another dtp restaurant thing? i had turkey sandwich and found it pretty bland except for the mustard which wasnt cajun as expected rather typical spicy brown. my bread was good.what blew me away in flavor was the vegan gumbo i sampled and the full order of beans with sausage and rice. hope they decide to expand on their beans to include vegan too. will definitely return for those items if looking for quick bite for lunch in area again, however thats likely less and less between outrageous parking fees and traffictourists theres too many more convenient options for locals
the interior of the place is fantastic and the wine list is as well.  the list is much better than the wooden vine, in my opinion, which supposedly has the best wine list in charlotte.there are, however, a few kinks which they must work out  which is completely understandable.  first, ill start with everyones first impression of the place  the hostess who would be fired if i was the manager.  she did not welcome us and barely said hello.  i actually had to ask her if we could have a table.  she said, yeah just sit.  she did not offer us a menu or wine list.  the place was not busy, yet we sat for a few minutes as in perhaps 5 minutes before someone greeted us by asking whether we were offered the wine list.  i said no and then the hostess brought them over.  fired.  we were told that we could still order dessert or cheese, but when i asked my server 5 minutes later if we could order dessert, we were told no.  no big deal.  it was late.  i get it.from the time we were seated to the time we actually got our bottle of wine, it was about 25 minutes, which was kind of ridiculous because it was very late and business was slow.  the manager or sommelier was very knowledgeable about the wine we ordered and was able to converse with my guest who is an international wine researcher and winemaker, which was a plus.our server was nice, but she seemed very nervous and not confident with the wine.last bitchy comment i have is that they were playing 80s music  janet jackson, etc., which seemed extremely weird and unfitting for the environment.  i will absolutely be back as i feel this place is a real jewel minus the kinks.  i want to try the food and will definitely be back for the wine.  ps  fire the hostess!
i wanted to give this place two chances before i posted a review.  upon my first try to corkbuzz, the first complaint was the sign.  none of my friends could find the place.  i was told they are getting a new sign.  the inside of corkbuzz is very attractive.  they have a beautiful private room that looks to seat around 20, with a long rectangular table and abstract art.  i would love to use it sometime.  now to the important part...the food. one reason i wanted to wait is because i felt like maybe i ordered wrong the first time.  the waitress pushed how the braised octopus was the best thing on the menu.  she went as far to say there has never been anyone who did not like it. i am an adventurous eater, so i ordered it, of course.  maybe octopus is just not my thing, but i did not enjoy it. i also ordered the cured salmon.  it was very fresh and looked pretty on the plate, but a bit plain. i tried the trout, nothing memorable, but not bad.   fast forward to my second trip back.  again, the waiter raved about the braised octopus! i decided to order the warm olives, which were well seasoned and interesting.   i also ordered the crab cake, which came on top of overflowing aioli with a scoop of tomato jam on top.  both the aioli and jam were way too much for the crab cake.  i did think the both had a nice flavor, but you only need a smear of the jam, not a hefty scoop.  it was too sweet if i had eaten it, as served.  the crab cake itself was pretty good.  the greens beside the crab cake were delightful!  i tried the scallops over spaghetti squash and they were tasty.  i could not get enough of the spaghetti squash, it was perfection.  as far as the wine, i enjoyed it both times and found the list impressive.  our servers both times seemed knowledgable about the wines.the bottom line is that i will be back. there are improvements to be made with some of the dishes. and last but not least  stop pushing the braised octopus!  it really is not for everyone!
i want to love corkbuzz but instead will say i like it have been there 3 or 4 times since its opening. i went to corkbuzz on opening week for dinner with a group and the kitchen was slow which is to be expected for a new restaurant. i ordered the roasted chicken and a glass of wine and both were good. none of us had any complaints about the food or drink.the next few times i went to corkbuzz, i was with a group of girlfriends where we ordered mixed drinks, wine and appetizers to share. the wine list is extensive and awesome and predictably pricey  especially given the location.  the good...the food brussel sprouts, cauliflower, cheese plates, spiced nuts, olivesthe winethe not so good...the slow service continued over multiple visitsthe very loud, ridiculously loud, dining area the nitpicky...given the pricey wine list and high rent locale, i am not that impressed with the decor and space. corkbuzz reminds me of a basic space that youd find in a hotel designated loungewinehangout area. it reminds me of a lobby.
the food was good, its a step up from panda. had beef and broccoli and beef lo mein, good flavor, fast delivery.
i am a huge fan of asian food and am always down to try new places. i just dont understand why there are no places here in surpriseoksaigon kitchen is the exceptionbut no other places in surprise that can do asian cuisine. while the portions here are very generous, it really doesnt matter how generous if the food is just meh. the service is nice, the prices are good and they try really hard to please, but you cant get past the meh food.
i attended a soft open of this restaurant for invited guests. guests were served a sampling of plates including szechuan dumplings, kimchi fried rice, mongolian beef, and pad thai.the szechuan dumplings came with a dipping sauce that was tangy and flavorful.  the rest of the dishes were lacking in spice and flavor. perhaps when the restaurant opens, i hope the spice level will be made to order. the pad thai was also missing crushed peanuts.it looks like the price per dish is about 1012. by casino standards i suppose thats good value. but you can go to many other asian restaurants in the city and get better tasting dishes for this price.
the food was ok not great. it was just a preopening that the casino. the food had light tastes to them and the noodle was very oily. i like the shumai only. the rest that they served were pad thai which was lacking the peanuts, the fried rice was not very tasty, stirred beef with veggies was ok but too sweet, and the pork dumplings were pretty good. overall the service was very good but needs to work on the food. the price was decent. it was under 15 per dish. i mean it would not be a restaurant i would like go back to. you can get better asian food outside the casino. the place was a little small and it was kind of odd having the tables like a bar and hard to get around, my mom said it was like a fast food restaurant. not good for kids because they can get hurt walking under the tables. not enough room for parties.
i have a hard time finding the most perfect tom yum in the states, so i stopped ordering it after all the failed attempts... until.... i saw it offered here on the menu. i hesitated but i went all in. i ordered the tom yum and it wasnt too bad. the lemongrass flavoring was perfect! i could have used a few more shrimps i guess shrimp is expensive and so they cut corners on cost here also instead of egg noodle, be sure to ask for rice noodle. i got a bowl of thick egg noodles, which made my soup broth disappear. i prefer rice noodles with my tom yum. i gave this place a 3 star only because i enjoyed the broth more so than i have ever, since coming back from bangkok. im so picky about my tom yum... the service at wuhu noodle is always so friendly and efficient!!! i would recommend their pad thai  highest level of spicy possible. i love spicy. if it isnt spicy then its not worth eating.
the peking duck stem buns were yummy but beware of bones.  the shrimp chow mein was yummy with a little char from the wok  but a little oily.  my 7 yr. old loved the won ton soup.
my first impression is no bueno, based on the nonexistent greeting i received while standing at the ordering counter. i managed to order and chose the curry pork  shrimp noodles with egg. it was very tasty though a tad overpriced at 10. my order was to go and i added hot sauce to the dish at home.the menu is varied and quite extensive. the decor is similar to pei wei, nice and slightly upscale. the few times ive walked by its always been busy. this may be just what was missing from the silvertons restaurant portfolio!!
great potential but it can use some improvements.i went for a late lunch, so it was not very crowded, but the food took forever to arrive, even though i ordered something directly from the lunch menu with no modifications. given the time of the day, this was not something i expected, so i didnt time it or anything, but it felt like half an hour. while waiting, i responded to some emails and got through a big chunk of a new yorker article their articles are long, in case you dont already know.the service was good, but felt awkward: visibly counting with a finger to make sure they were certain of the table number before taking an order, that sort of thing. all of the servers in my section looked very focused and nervous, like theyre terrified of making a mistake or something. as they gain more experience, hopefully they will start to relax, or at least learn to hide their anxiety, so the guests can relax.another item that may be considered minor or major, depending on who you are, is the shiny table top with all the puddles from the water glasses. no tablecloth, no menuasplacemat, no coaster, no cocktail napkin, none of that  just one notsoabsorbent large napkin you are supposed to use to wipe your mouth, and i am not the type to multipurpose a napkin. so the puddles remained through the whole meal, which im sure is not something the architect or interior designer of this very modern and polished space approves of. if i were rating on food alone i would give it a 5 for the mediterranean chicken. my overall raring for this one visit is really more like 3.5. the graphic flavor chart for the wine list is interesting but not very useful when its printed on the back of the list. which reminds me of another thing: somebody needs to work on the design of the menu. the font for the wine flavor chart is huge, while the food menu is packed in with tiny font; neither are easy to read. would like to go back in a few months after they have a chance to work out some kinks.
the place is cool but the food was meh. party of 8 for sunday brunch at 1 p and they were out of mimosas and 3 other dishes on the menu. the waiters response was its that time of day when we start running out of our popular items brunch goes till 4p. ill probably try the place out again in a couple of weeks to see if they worked out the tweaks.
food was ok. nothing that blew me away. the bloody mary was delicious and spicy. love the buildings and the decor. lots of unused space though. more seating needed. they were out of champagne. never good  especially for brunch.
dont be intimidated by the offerings or mechanisms they have what you want in a coffee shop.  they are more of a specialty place though so be prepared to hear why...its a cool story.  i had a latte and it was very good my husband got an iced coffee and did not really like it but bear in mind that starbucks is his favorite so take that opinion with a grain of salt!!
i just realized this chipotle was open in the old qdoba space so during my lunch hour i decided to grab a togo order to take back to the office. it wasnt until i arrived and checked in that i saw the bad reviews of this location. i decided based on some of the previous reviews to order a bowl  asked for my salsa on the side, which they were happy to oblige.i think they have been trying to train people a little better since the grand opening because the folks making my food seemed to be doing an ok job. the kitchen seemed a little chaotic and the assembly line could use a little better flow...but it wasnt as bad as i expected based on the reviews when they first opened.so while this location  may still have a few small kinks to work out, it seems like they are headed in the right direction. i will definitely going back to give them another try later on.
food was excellent but the music was way to loud...temp was cold inside also not comfortable. chips way to salty...
the fella and i were pretty excited to hear that tapas 51 had opened since we live nearby and since fort mill needs more good restaurants. we popped in on a wednesday night, and the place was about half full. theyve done a big revamp since the passion8 days, and its much brighter inside! they could still use a few more decorations since the main wall is huge and naked, but theyre getting there. its still fairly small inside with maybe 12 tables in the main dining room and a bar with 8 chairs.we were promptly greeted and seated, and our waiter came right over to take our order. we started with a glass of wine and a beer mostly local offerings and perused the menu. i wasnt sure what the header churrasco meant, and i asked the waiter; he seemed confused and had to look at the menu. he said, oh, that means from the grill! ah, okay. service was spoton, and im sure itll only get even better with time.we started with the brussels sprouts 4, which were divine. they were tangy and vinegary, and i wish i knew what else was in them. mmmm. the fella got the pulled pork tacos, and i got the coffee crusted brisket tacos  there were 3 tacos each for 9. sadly, my brisket was pretty charred, and both sets of tacos were dry. mine had avocado, so that helped, and the fellas had some pickled onions, which provided a little juice, but they were fairly bland and underwhelming.for dessert, we split a chocotorta, which i thought meant it had chocolate in it, but there was no chocolate. it was good, but i spent the whole time eating it thinking they might have brought me the wrong dessert. it was sort of a dulche de leche cake with marshmallow creme on top... fine, but not what i thought i was getting.all told, we spent 50  tip for two sets of tacos, brussels sprouts, dessert, a glass of wine, and two beers, so not too shabby. i appreciate what theyre going for, and realizing theyve only been open a week, i dont want to be too harsh! theres room for improvement, and i think theyre anxious to do just that. well definitely give them another try, and ill look forward to upping their rating.
great selection of food, several combinations ive never heard before . very quaint and quirky atmosphere. most of the dishes were pretty good but by far, chorizo sliders and squash were the best!
my husband  i were really excited about trying this place after seeing the rave reviews online. the ambiance was cool, even though we were the only people in the restaurant in the entire time. they had some good local beer. sadly, we were disappointed with the food. we had the brisket tacos, a swordfish taco special, brussel sprouts, corn  a dessert. the only thing we really enjoyed was the corn. the beef tacos were fatty. the dessert was inedible. it was a taco torte apparently we thought the waiter said chocolate torte. it had definitely tasted as if had been sitting in a fridge for a week or more. it was like a dessert you are forced to eat at a family reunion that your great aunt made...an instant dessert of sorts. so bad. i know its tapas but the portions were very tiny. we spent 60 and i left hungry.
took by niece here for a quick bite based on the reviews here. the staff was very friendly. the food was fresh but nothing special. would expect a little more and something to make the food a little more special. instead of just an ordinary sandwich
le personnel est vraiment tres sympathique, rien a redire non plus sur la petite terrasse lete un peu a lecart des grandes rues... je nai pas ete trop impressionnee par le cafe mais les sandwichs sont a tomber mais un peu horsbudget pour moi.... ca vaudra au moins le coup de retenter cet hiver apres quelques mois de roulement!
i found myself in this store because i was looking for a specific product and their website said it could be found there.  they did have it and its .50 less than whole foods but that is not saying much.  having walked around a little i think the prices are extremely high and the selection on certain items is not very good.  you will never find me pushing a cart in here for that reason.  but if money is no object this is the store for you!  i never frequented it when it was vons so i have nothing to compare it to as far as layout.  the employees that ive encountered while browsing are friendly as are the cashiers but the store is a ghost town and every time ive been there has not been more than one cashier open but there really doesnt need to be.  i dont imagine this store will survive long.  the 3 stars are for the friendliness of the employees and for having my specialty item.
i should first mention that it seems the new downtown madison branch of this restaurant is still in its growing pains phase, and shows promise. truly. but the smell of paint is still fresh, the staff is still getting used to their surroundings and figuring out how their menu works. now, the food was good. we had a couple of burgers and while i was sad they could not cook burgers to requested temperatures im a medium rare kind of girl everything was juicy, fast, and tasty. one was a peanutbutter burger and the other a jalapeno popper burger, which was the better of the two in my opinion. however we ordered some things that never arrived we asked for the sweet potato fries and cajun fries as our sides for our respective burgers, and instead received 1 large basket of cajun fries to share even though we were literally the only other nonstaff at the bar that day, so its not like we got someone elses food by accident. the bar staff were nice and attentive if a little... quirky. they definitely told us some things about themselves that seemed odd to share with random firsttime customers, but hey i can cope. im not here to judge you. the beer list, as promised, was very extensive and descriptive. it was a little oddly presented though, as a set of white standard printerpaper sheets stapled in the top corner like a highschool book report. but if you dont mind the presentation, the list was well organized and clear.  the chalkboard wall list on the other hand looked like a giant wall of confusion to me. it seemed like more of a photoop wall than an actual useful list. im sure its there just to have your photo taken in front of 50 beers.anyway i will be back to try it again, as i think this chain might do well despite the nearly oppressive number of brewhouses in downtown madison these days. theres no shortage of 22 year old college kids just discovering that theres more to beer than budweiser, and downtown is always hopping so even with the new hop cat that opened nearly simultaneously, i think they can make a go of it. by the way, i read a pair of reviews where someone faulted their service and attitude for not serving their red wine chilled. red wine should be room temp and so it will always be stored at room temp. but if someone is being weird about it, just throw some icecubes in their red wine or give them a chilled glass or whatever, and leave them to their weirdness instead of making them feel bad about it. thats how you lose tips. and if they should be ordering their drinks from their server agreed then just tell them their server will be right with them to take their order and bring the drinks to their table. thats just the nature of the service industry beast, you just have to suck it up and be nice about it, and coach the guest into correct behavior. just a suggestion.
the beer was good and the bartender was very friendly, but the decor was like when your brother who is living in your parents basement for too long decides to open a restaurants and isnt sure what do to with the space besides take design tips from chipotle and then designs a logosign for the outside of the store using microsoft word clip art from 2003 and then brings his man cave leather chairs.
just tried this place for the first time and id say it was a solid experience. i really enjoyed the beers i tried and the beer menu was quite extensive with lots of options for each different type of beer. id say it ranks better than hopcat for the happy hour specials because they have several more that qualify for the cheaper prices than hopcat does.the food menu did not impress me. they only had a couple of sides and the one i got sweet potato fries was way too salty. the entire entree menu was made up of burgers, and even though they could be substituted for black bean patties, it did not satisfy my vegetarian self.our server seemed to forget we were there. it took her much longer than usual to deal with the check and she would say shed be back in a minute to take our order, when in reality it took more like 58 minutes. all of this would be okay if the place was packed, but we were one of only four or five tables. she also forgot to bring us water, which i asked for twice.not sure if this was a fluke or not since everyone else seems to have been impressed with the service.overall, great place for beer but not a great restaurant.
the service was a little lacking. the burger was pretty good, nothing special. would give it another shot.
service could have been better, but all and all great food! definitely recommend the crab legs, they are delicious!
the food was good. but the service was very poor. it seemed like a very chaotic scene. we had different servers at times. it was a monday night too. youd think it might be a slow night. perhaps its because christmas is this week and everyone is out shopping. who knows ?after we were seated, it took about 20 minutes to be greeted by a server. my food order and my friends food order were delivered incorrect. i just had them deduct the error from the bill and not bother with a correction.i had high hopes for this place. maybe ill go back someday. i visited the indian school road location once and it was a great experience.
went there last night friday for the first time around 8:30, so a little later.  pretty quiet in there for a what should be one of the busier nights for a restaurant.  the food itself was solid tacos de carne asada.  good flavor on the steak.  the plate was overwhelmed with the side items refried and rice and the three tacos were set off to the side instead of featured.  my wife commented that her peach margarita was excellent.  on the other hand, she asked for water when she ordered the margarita and it never came, even as a manager asked us if there was anything else they could get for us.  their patio area is a nice place to sit out on a carolina evening.
the wife and i and my sister and her boyfriend had dinner here 91115.we started with drinkstexas size margaritas for them, a peach margarita for the wife and i tried the homemade sangria. all drinks were good and the sangria was not to sweet as some can be.for dinner my wife  ordered a veggie quesadilla and the rest of us got tacos de brisket which was shredded beef brisket with a great grilled flavor served in warm flour tortillas with pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and shredded lettuce for toppings. its was also served with rice and beans, the rice was ok, the beans were bland and needed more seasoning.where this place lost points was the service. it seemed like we did not have a specific server, just who ever was walking by the table. we had to flag down some one several times and the busier they got, the slower the service got. we asked for take out boxes that never came, so my sisters boyfriend had to go get them.overall, the food and drinks were good albeit higher priced than other mexican restaurants in the area. the service, at least on the night we visited, leaves a lot to be desired.the food and drinks are worth a return visit, but at the higher prices if the service does not improve on the second visit, there will be no third.
food was good, need to work on service and the owner is extremely  rude.dont think ill be back.
i love this style of pizza and i think they do a great job making it. i will say though that the pistachio pizza was incredibly oversalted. i give them three stars for ambience. theres a lot of underutilized space. the lovely brick wall is not emphasized at all. theyre currently using their dining area as storage space. the lighting is very, very bright.
went for a second time last night and the pizza was not as good. barely any sauce on the pepperoni pizza and the caesar salad was very boring. we ordered two pizzas and by the time we started eating the second, the dough was too chewy. i also dont like the fact they dont have plates. not sure i will return.
are here with the family. staff was nice, place was clean and new. pizzas were ok  but the price was not. probably wont be back.
stopped by this place after grabbing a postwork beer the week it opened. given that the place had only been open less than one week, i expected a few hiccups or maybe some strangeness in the way things were working. for instance, we werent allowed to sit outside because the cafe permits werent put in yet. but no big deal, im here for the pizza. i walked in and at the front desk there was a guy at an ipad and two customers talking to him. i assumed this was some sort of host deal but it turns out you have to order at this ipad dude and then take your seat. not my favorite, but again not entirely a hindrance to my enjoyment. i ordered a pretty simple pizza, something like a margherita, and a breadinfused olive oil plate. the bread and olive oil came pretty immediately, which was nice to snack on while we waited for the pizza. it was a little light on the bread, giving only three pieces between my friend and i, but it tasted pretty good. the pizza arrived soon after and i have to say it wasnt bad. it was a tad bit bland in my opinion but everything was really fresh and the crust had a good crunch to the outside. when i can go to a place like manolos or pizza m and get a pizza just this size or bigger for about the same price it brings in a lot of competition. then again both of those places are all the way over in urbana and there isnt another pizza place in downtown champaign, so maybe it doesnt matter for most people. all in all, not my favorite pizza place in town but definitely one ill be giving another visit. one comment though, i really hate the inside of this place. its extremely bright and there are just a number of large tables with chairs in the middle of the room. not a very comfortableinteresting atmosphere and something i think could be improved. just a thought.p.s. ive noticed recently people sitting outside so thats a plus!
2.5 stars.honestly, its average. i realize we dont live in champaign and our chicago based palate may be a bit biased but we love pizza. all types. we were hoping for a lovely experience so even the scary prices didnt fend us off. 14 for a personal size pizza and 3 for a can of italian soda? ooof! the flavors were definitely bland. of the four pizzas we ordered only the most standard satisfied pepperoni! i will say their dough is very good, the only problem being it is served so hot on a metal plate so it doesnt have space to breathe and gets soggy so very fast : the steep prices arent helped by the fact that this place is self serve. you grab your own plates and your own utensils as well as glasses. cool cafeteria concept, minus the cafeteria prices.if you live there and have few options plus are used to the oddly expensive food, i guess this is great. or you could save your money and come up by chi for the weekend and have something better :
restaurant reviewas part of my quest to eat at all of the new restaurants in chamabana, i found myself here for lunch early sunday morning with my son. dont get me wrong the pizza is very fresh with quality ingredients, but for the price you pay compared to blaze and pie guys, you are paying almost double. so really this is a 2 star for value and 3 for the pizza for the reason below.1. entrance very confusing. it was an architecture office previously. there is a large door that faces the register that has a giant sign handicap. only when you look around do you realize there is a side door to enter in2. ordering you do this in a foyer area which the handicap door drops you right into this room. the menu is on the wall and you order from an ipad. if you know what you want this will be quick if not based on the other reviews you maybe stuck behind someone ordering3. tables large cafeteria style tables except for a few in the back. also seats to watch while your pizza is cooked. again confusing there is a long hallway behind the register which you are suppose to take and then glass doors that empty into the back of the restaurant4. pizza yes the ingredients are fresh. i went with the pepperoni pizza to keep it simple. it will take more than the 90 seconds reported time to make your pizza. second after the pepperoni heats up it curls up into a cup filled with oil which is quite messy. third and the most important is that the crust is amazingly thin and crunchy, however after you take the first slice there was a gush of liquid coming either from the cheese or toppings that just fills up the bottom of the plate making the amazing crust now soggy and messy. all and all for 15 dollars for a small brick oven thin crust pizza is simply overpriced. yes it is tasty, but it has many pitfalls as well.pros: fresh premium ingredients, cooked to order, plenty of seating. no need for tip.cons: very confusing restaurant layout, expensive, an amazing crust that becomes soggy from either the cheese or other toppings happens after you take that first slice. slow service.hidden deals:nonehealth code rating: a. very clean and modern. no inspection report available online yet.
good family style pizza
we had visited pizzeria antica last week.  first of all, the food was fabulous  all fresh ingredients, but i was a bit disappointed in the atmosphere.  the dining area was much too bright and uncomfortable.  i felt that i was sitting in a high school cafeteria with bright lights and larger tables.  i would highly recommend that they dim the lights and get more tables for 4.  the staff was very friendly, but needs to learn how to open a bottle of wine....and perhaps serve  the wine to the patron instead of handing them the bottle.  they had no wine glasses, just water glasses.  growing up in chicago, i felt that the pizza was a bit soggy at the bottom.  if fact there was a puddle of liquid on the serving plate.  i would have like the bottom crust to be a little crispier.
i love pizza and after trying hundreds of pizza... i think i have pretty high expectations. we walked by this place when out one night to get a glass of wine. returning a week later with our son, we gave antica a shot. i cant say that i am thrilled we went. they have a nice atmosphere going on here, a well thought and organized menu. the whole place has its own unique and fresh vibe! but... the pizza was a disappointment. both of us got the bianca 4 cheese and my husband added sausage to his. both were fairly lacking in flavor and the ricotta was cold in the larger chunks. this is a sauceless pizza, but the menu doesnt say that. with sauce, fresh oregano and more heat... it would have been stunning!  the crust is well executed and had a great balance of chewycrunch. perhaps one of the better crusts i have ever had after naples, italy... but thats hard to match. this place boasts a authentic italian theme, but this fell short in service. there was no serving staff. just a cook and the owner. neither of which sported a very friendly face... we never got checked on until we asked... our water ran out and we never got silverwear until we asked... even then, it was grabbed off another table for us a table with people at it! awkward. i think the table in the back was family of friends... because they got all the attention while the rest of the guest were slightly ignored. it would be a smart move to hire a super friendly server who will spend equal attention to all the guests, while fully explaining the menu. smiles are worth more money than you would think. my last thought... all the tables here are for 6 people... this would make for an award date night... a few 2 person table would be a great idea. just like the bianca... this place is just a bit to sauceless for me. spice it up all over and youll have a winner. but with all the competition is cu... this place is short a slice. also note: this place pays its staff a living wage, so there is no tipping.
after returning for a second time, noticed that the ordering and seating process is quite different. its now in the form of a more traditional restaurant: wait to be seated, give order to server, etc. we were sat, given a number, and not approached for close to 10 minutes. the server maybe owner was super gruff with us, like visibly and audibly annoyed that we were unfamiliar with the process now, and came back to the table once during the meal. not into it.
the pizza was good. it aims at offering an authentic italian pizza, something i think theyve come pretty close to and still cater to americans who like a lot of toppings. the atmosphere was strange to me, very quiet and very brightly lit, but the staff was excellent!
read full review!!!! so i had my 3d eyebrows done about 3 days ago and the experience was fine not painful at all, keeping in mind i have a high pain tolerance. the atmosphere was great. the salon was clean and staff was friendly. i am only giving 4 stars because i wish i would have gone a lil thinner with a higher arch but that is totally my fault because i didnt think of it until it was too late and she did not draw or trace them on ahead of time so the shape is kinda in her hands.   the woman doing my service had a student observing which i liked because i got a lot of my questions answered by just listening to them talk. they have not fully healed so i am still excited to see finished product and update my review.10 days laterupdate do not get this service done if you have anything important to do within the few days 7 fallowing. u will peal and it wont look pretty. im attaching a follow up photo witch shows how much the strokes fade and how sporadic they look. my eyebrows are not full have two different shapes and a few bald spots. im not upset because i can draw them in to look even if i have to but kinda defeats the purpose of the service and spending 300. that is the reason i am changing to three stars.
je suis allee 2 fois, la 1ere fois le cafe etait excellent mais la 2eme fois jai ete decue
just tried a free class. i liked it, trainers are very nice but its easy to get left out if you are not in the rhythm.....  very clean but small gym. also, my heart rate monitor wasnt accurate. you dont sprint on a 7 in a treadmill for a minute and your heart stays at 40... wtf. pending further review until another class trial.
my experience at melk was more meh. if only the coffee tasted as good or as strong as it smelled. its a good place to get decent coffee. but the welcoming aroma gets washed away by a rather bland pull.
it is a hard one to rate, because the number of stars really depends on ones purpose for visiting the cafe, and comparable options in the neighborhood. as for me, i went there to get a little work done on my laptop while enjoying a morning snack in a nice atmosphere. because i happened to be downtown, it was a good option: the latte was ok not the best in town for my taste, and i was really happy with the many options for snacks i.e., fresh baked goods especially given the limited space they have. i had a strawberry vanilla scone, and i enjoyed it. friendly service, and nice decor. but when i set up to work, i decided not to sit by the front window because the view was not very nice. then, the noise level both from the street and from the music was so high that i wondered if i could concentrate on my work. later on, the noise went down but the ac was a bit too high glad i had a sweater. i did not see any wifi but i did not enquire about it because i did not really needed it.overall, because this cafe is in a business district, with a clientele mostly made up of workers who grab their coffee and go, it might be the best option in the area for that purpose certainly bettern than a generic starbuck or tim hortons. but i would not go out of my way to go work there; better options are available in the plateau, mile end, rosemont, and villeray.
if you expect original melk quality coffee, youll be solely disappointed.i had very low expectations going in as i got wind from fellow coffee drinkers that this location is subpar compared to the mothership. as it turned out, i, too, was disappointed despite keeping the hype in check.while they do serve 49th which the original does to perfection, they also use the awful detour coffee. yes, awful. detour is very similar to pilot coffee in term of taste and flavor profile which is not surprising as both come from the same neighborhood pilot from toronto and detour from hamiltonburlington. mind you, im no fan of pilot and anything remotely closed to it is awful to me only good coffee in the gta region is cut coffee and pig ironif you enjoy pilot coffee, youll be happy here. i am not. as for baked goods, theyre from the mothership but you dont get the freshly baked aroma of it which lessen the whole awesome experience of what makes melk great.is the place worth it? with barely any good coffee shops downtown, maybe. a big yes if they drop detour and stick to 49th
its been a year and a half since i was last seen by a dermatologist because of my move to nevada. went in for screening as ive had basal cell in the past. nice office and my visit with the pa was friendly and professional. i had a particular spot i was concerned about and they agreed it needed to be biopsied. they did the biopsy and froze some other precancerous spots. i was told i needed to come back in two weeks for the results of the biopsy. when i came back in two weeks, i was charged an office visit for results! this is the first time ive ever heard of an office charging to give results. because of this kind of practice, i will be going somewhere else. its just not right to charge someone for something youve basically already paid for.
it was a little overrated. i have had better wings at albertsons. also the prices were not very friendly. 2 orders of wings fries and drinks almost 50 bucks!
pretty cool little location, they are located in the food court area of the venetian but the way they have their store setup it makes it feel like a little wing bar. they had some sauces out to try and see what you would want, but would only let you sample 2, thus limiting my ability to choose wisely which sauce i wanted. they only have 8 or so, so its not a huge selection, but the ones i tried 3 total, since i tried 2 and ordered a different one were just okay. i settled on their medium buffalo, and since i had babies to take care of i opted for the boneless against my normal preference to make minimize messy fingers. it was fine but not as spicy as i thought it would be considering the mild was the one i tried and assumed it would have been a bit more spicy than that, but really thats just preference and didnt affect my review. the chicken was just okay, and at least 3 pieces had some unpleasant gristle in them, and though i cant be certain, they just sort of seemed to be frozen chicken bites like the anytizers ones or something. the sauce itself other than not being as spicy as i thought was pretty good, but i prefer my wings to be quite saucy rather than just lightly coated and served sort of dry, and there was no leftover pool of sauce left in the basket. they also had a strange afterspice to them that sort of lingered strangely in the back of the throat that i didnt care for. my wife settled on the chicken cheesesteak which i think they should have just called chicken philly or something since a cheesesteak implies specifically that there is steak in there, and though i was not confused by this or expecting anything, and it was laid out well on their menu, but i guess thats just a suggestion, as the name is like an oxymoron. all that nonsense aside it was quite good but a bit small. it came with grilled onions and they were very tasty and well caramelized. both entrees also came with a side of seasoned fries which were good. the service wasnt anything special, and the girl at the coulter was a bit awkward and shy, so ordering was difficult. i also ordered 2 extra ranch sides  which cost 1.50!  in addition to the one they give you with the wings, and when i got my order she asked ranch or bleu cheese and i was a bit confused since i was the only customer she had helped all day we walked up right as they were opening and so i confirmed ranch and she gave me just the one. when i asked for the 2 more she said they are 0.75 each... hmmm you really forgot about that from ringing me up then only standing there with a blank look for 5 minutes since? anyway so i said i had already paid for 2, so after asking to see my receipt she gave me one more now making my total 2 in case you arent following i should be getting 3 total then i said, yeah i need one more, and again confused she said it would be 0.75, so i pointed out on my receipt i had paid for 2 and she said i had 2, so i asked doesnt the meal come with 1? then she got it!overall ity wasnt bad, it just wasnt great, and i probably wouldnt ever eat here again, just because it isnt worth the time or money it, like everything in vegas was pretty pricey.
i was expecting this to be an actual bar,  but its essentially a counter service restaurant in a food court.   i tried the traditional and boneless wings with medium sauce and fries with cajun spice.   the fries were the best part of the meal.   the were cooked just right  a little crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside.   the wings were just average.   overall,  the meal was just ok.   i probably will not go back.   there are better food options in vegas, and i can get better wings at other chain restaurants at home.
not impressed at all, i purchased the single combo. i had it split in hot and medium wings... mind you all i read some of the reviews prior to coming and i didnt let it deter me... i wish i had listen, it was slightly better than flavorless... will not be returning. also, they are stingy with the sauce, the lack of sauce could be contributing to the lack of flavor. the fries with cajun seasoning was on point though.
had i only been here once, i wouldve given at least a 4 star. i ordered the double wings with lemon pepper and hot flavors, and both tasted great. it came with celery and dressing. however, i liked it so much my first time i had to come back and try the other flavors. this time the experience was the complete opposite of my first. i ordered the chipotle and honey ginger. the first problem was i couldnt even tell which was which. im used to chipotle being a smoky, dry tasting flavor. but both flavors were covered in sauce. i took it back to the counter and asked what the flavors were, and the woman i ordered from initially said terriyaki, but then realized i didnt order that flavor, and changed her answer to chipotle. needless to say, it was overly saucy. and on top of that, they added all the wings together, so the honeyginger wings were doused in the flavors of the other wings. they obviously should have separated the two flavors of wings. at the end, i didnt even want to finish the last of the wings. im being generous and giving them 3 stars for a positive first experience. but they either mixed up my order the second time, or some of their wings just dont taste good. either way, they dropped a few stars for an average of my two experiences there.
i was very excited to visit this brewery as its fairly close to my house and they had a great groupon special for a beer flight. however, i was fairly disappointed and only enjoyed four of the eight beers. they have a long bar and large table for seating along with games to play with friends while drinking. its minimally decorate, but works well with the atmosphere. they do have select paninis available from a local shop down the road that might be worth checking out.
stopped in today to check out the digs...small and cool.  tiny lot but only one building away from the corner, so not a far jaunt for street parking.nice that on a saturday afternoon it wasnt packed...just right....  the beertender, brad, was really friendly and attentive.  i had a flight....liked them all....and that he offered up some cold press to mix with the jomax.  not a coffee drinker but really liked it.  for the beer.  for the service.  for the prices.  for the location.  will definitely be back!!  thanks wren house!
so a new place that opened up in the stdenis death zone outside of le couteau and matraca. it totally feels like a death zone. anyway, this place serves mainly waffles or crepes, coffee and gelato. do not confuse it for the clothing store brand in france even though they share the same name..as i was biking on stdenis, i saw the place and remembered seeing something on instagram so i decided to stop by and might as well try. it was around 6pm and place was dead empty! i really mean dead empty. only other clients were some tourists that went in just after me and a couple outside.i looked at their menu, settled with a macchiato and a plain gaufre de liege since they do waffles. gaufre de liege is different from your regular light fluffy waffles as the preparation is a yeast dough instead of the pancake like batter and load with pearl sugar. it is much smaller and denser. the waffle was crispy, sweet from the sugar and the dusting, had a somewhat subtle caramel flavor and dense. it was quite good. dressing up the waffle though was pretty unnecessary. all i wanted was a plain waffle, nothing else.as for the coffee, i found it to be lacking. it helped washing down the waffle and sweetness but in itself, it left me disinterested.so waffle was good but ill let people from brussels judge the qualityauthenticity of it as ive never really had great gaufres de liege. and id skip coffee because of le couteau nearby unless its closed.
i was a few minutes late to be picked up by sunrise cab and taken to sky harbor on a recent friday morning otherwise this would be a solid five star review.as others have mentioned these oldschool 1980s cabs can be seen roaming the central phoenix streets and avenues  but you dont see them much in other parts of town although they serve the entire valley.regardless, the cabbie was nice, a little rough looking, told me about his sexual conquest the night before with some barflys at philthy phils.  taxicab confessions, anyone?he also explained that sunrise is much cheaper than discount, yellow and aaa, much better to work for than they are  and that they are the preferred cab service of phoenixs gay bars.  friendly cabbie, not so prompt service, a typical 20 cab ride that was 13.  3.5 stars for sunrise.
closed  when jman lamented to me at a bar that sunrises phone number was dead i asked a bartender if he knew anything and sunrise did in fact go out of business.  a sad day for cab riders, perhaps they should have raised their prices a bit or got some priuses.
took a family friend there to try it for the first time it was ok.. there was issues with seating us as the host were chatting among them selves trying to figure out where to go . then servers came up and said no go here or here so it just became awkward. we werent given a drink menu so we had to ask for one, its interesting to have them on an ipad .. they need to update them though because they had drafts beers listed that they didnt carry, kinda a bummer. the server was nice , guided us through the menu.. we started out with crab cake and firecracker shrimp , the shrimp was pretty good but the crab cake was nothing that we expected . it was small and for 9 you only get one , it wasnt that good. my boyfriend ordered the chicken and biscuits it was way way way too much rosemary .. it just tasted like a giant rosemary in your mouth, he couldnt really eat it. my friend got the smothered chicken and rice it was alright he said the ham tasted like processed ham and was too salty. i got the bacon wrapped filet , the steak was delicious thats the one thing we could all agree on. we were here for  a little over two hours and we definitely did not want to be , the appetizers took about 15 mins which is standard , but then after we ate them our salads didnt come for over 20 mins.. that was a little irritating .. right when the salads came not even 30 seconds later our food came .. the server never did a two bite check which probably would have helped with my boyfriends rosemary dish . also i could see the gm introducing herself to tables around and saying thank you for coming .. she never came to our table , i feel like because we look young or what not she didnt feel the need to stop at our table. im in the industry i know how manager table touches work and i didnt feel like we were acknowledged at all . were debating on going back, we might give it one more chance but i doubt it .
i know theyre a new restaurant, so still need to improve on some things. the employees need more training with customer service. they sauteed the asparagus and the menu said it was supposed to be steamed, while the sauteed mixed vegetables were steamed. my meal was supposed to include bread, but it was missing.. the food tasted good, but please fix little issues.
the service from our waitress was awesome. the food was good. so why 3 stars you ask, a couple of issues. i ordered the bacon wrapped filet, with a baked potato and a side of mac and cheese. in the description it says each of the below listed items come with bread. so my steak came out and there was no bread nor was it wrapped in bacon and i didnt notice until i was half way done with my meal. the baked potato was good, it looked loaded with chives, cheese, bacon and sour cream but i was half way done with it and all the topping were gone, i recommend they really load the topping so the whole potato can partake in the mouth to stomach exercise. finally i felt like i was in between a casual hangout country western style place and a high class style restaurant. it was kinda an odd feeling. they put paper over the table cloths to write on and the menus are printed  kinda like i would expect at a bargrill, but they bring the condiments out in small 2 or 4 oz little cup.. not good if you really like to load on ketchup or mustard.will i be back? absolutely.. next time ill make sure to get the bread and bacon and double up on the toppings
this was our first time here and were excited for a new steakhouse in the northwest part of town. we made reservations for 5:30 and were promptly seated. it took about 10 minutes for our waiter to take a drink order. we were disappointed that they were already out of calamari so we ordered the fire shrimp. the quantity was nice, but was a bit too citrus flavored and lacked spice. the wedge salad was decent size and tasted good. the crab cake was large but we would not order it again as it too was citrus flavored. the filet oscar was large but the bernaise was lacking. the crab was a tad overcooked. the steak did have good flavor and was cooked perfectly to medium.  the white cheddar mashed potatos were plain with no flavor and had a gritty texture. the best parts of the meal were the lobster mac n cheese. it was very large with plenty of lobster and noodles. very rich and great flavor. the homemade bread was outstanding. my daughter ordered the chicken alfredo. it lacked sauce, but was a large portion. my son ordered the mini corn dogs. he thought they were very good, but he is not a fan of big steak fries. with this being a recently opened business, we hope that in time they work out the issues with the menu. their bappy hour menu looks appealing and we will be returning soon to try it.our waiter was very friendly and quick to fill our requests. the restaurant is large with booths,  and square tables. it looks as though it can accomadete larger groups and has a private room. there is also outside seating.
this place is pretty decent. service was great,  entire staff very accommodating and friendly.  food was good not great i ordered a chicken sandwich with steak fries and dinner salad. maybe next time ill try a steak, i guess thats what their known for. also tried the cheesesteak egg rolls app. a little different, they were good but a little bit greasy.atmosphere is nice and relaxing. ill go back and try a steak.
new to the centennial area and near to my house for food intake. we went late last night and sat at the bar. bartenders were great and helpful. service was fast and the food was good. the only reason i wouldnt go more often is because of the music. its all country. and yes, i really do not like the newer style country that much. enough for it to hinder me from eating at a particular location. the food was good. not my favorite, but it was good. and its awesome that this place is open until 2am. centennial doesnt have a ton of late night options. la food:their rolls. good god alive, the rolls are amazing. blue cheese wedge  yummy blue cheese dressing with crispy onions and cherry tomatoes. stuffed mushrooms  very good. the only thing is i wish they would put more crab and less mayonnaise. prime rib  pretty good. rare as it comes as requested. the sauce and the horseradish was tasty.filet oscar  merh. this was my least favorite. the filet was good, but the asparagus was not and the bearnaise sauce wasnt tasty either. i ordered the white cheese mashed potatoes with my meal. and they were not good. not creamy, dry and had no taste. the bartender told us that they had a really rough opening and the cooks were not really prepared. so maybe thats why the food isnt the best. im willing to wait a couple of months and go again.
my family and i were here for dinner last night. nice decor, slightly country, though that is the theme. not a fan of walking into a nice restaurant and the bar being right there. seating is comfortable, table service nice. servers are still getting the menu down as are the cooks. new openings sometimes take a few months to get all of the kinks worked out.all in all, the food was good, service was standard. not the best place in the centennial hills area but it is still young. i would recommend it however keep in mind it just opened a few weeks ago.
the drinks amazing!! the service was terrible. we went during lunch time i dont know if that makes a difference between lunch and dinner.. the food was mediocre and the prices dont match the quality.. i liked the ambiance and i think they are just new and need to work on somethings. we ordered oysters the ice melted all over the table. no one checked on us we had to find them to get something and to tell them about the ice. i complained about the beet salad and all the waitress said was oh well i dont like beets so thats too bad.... not too happy right now. but the bartender was on point! i will go back for happy hour!
ate here on august 13th,  2015 for my birthday.  the service was good,  our server was really nice his name is rick. we just so happened to arrive during happy hour so we ordered a 3 appetizers.  out of the 3 apps peel  eat shrimp... great,  oyster...great, but the ahi tuna...total thumbs down. ..way too salty. told the manager who was on duty at the time  all be said was, we appreciate all opinions. ......ohkayyy!!!! youd think he would show good customer service  have his chef remake the item but didnt offer to make it right.  anyways,  now for the main course. ..i ordered the pistachios crusted fishcant recall which fish they crusted but it was overly breadedcrusted...i couldnt taste the fish. .. didnt eat that or bother to bring it to the attention of the care less manager.  i figure if its left on the plate theyd get it....my husband ordered the prime rib... he said that was good. so, i know this is a new restaurant in town therefore i will give it another try. it def has potential. for now it is perfect for bar food.
last night we invited my auntie and uncle to dinner.  we hoped for a nice dinnerhowever we sat too close to the bar and it was extremely loud and not a pleasant environment... considering i had to make reservations on opentable because firerock cant take reservations for 5 or less?!? i asked for seating near a window and a nice table but we were next to the bar...during its rowdy happy hour crowd.   not a pleasant experience for any of us.  since i could not hear looking at the plates of food i really noticed the plating of the food is not that appealing or tantalizing to the senses... yes food tasted good.  this is my fourth visit to my neighborhood restaurant and i have to rate you all two stars less for the atmosphere and lack luster plate presentation.
i have to say i was disappointed. i was under the impression it was more of a family restaurant. we were seated close to the bar and it was really loud. perhaps if we had been seated in the rear of the restaurant we would have had a more enjoyable experience. food was decent along with the service. im not sure if we will return and if we would it wont be anytime soon.
i was excited to try this new establishment. upon arriving during late night happy hour 11pm2am mondaysunday, front door was locked and didnt offer signage pointing to an alternative entrance through the south side of the establishment. it is brand new to the centennial hills area. great outdoor area for dining. indoors is filled with tasteful cowboy memorabilia. the atmosphere is very inviting even from the bar. the background music left little to be desired. it was intermittently playing throughout our dining experience as though we were playing a game of musical chairs. late night happy hour menu is an abbreviated version of their full menu. although, it is primarily a steakhouse, i wouldve loved to see some alternatives in the entree section such as seafood.there are several drinks that are half off during this time. we did have to ask several times for clarity. hopefully, they will create a menu with happy hour drinks.
finally had a chance to try out this much needed addition to the local eateries in centennial hills.  parking was easy and the interior very welcoming.  we chose to eat at a high top table in the bar area.  lots of televisions around so it doesnt matter where you sit, youll always have a view.  its also noisy so if you want something more intimate, try the dining room.  a minitablet served as a drink menu and i had a delicious old fashion.  my partner ordered a glass of wine.  she ordered the 8 ounce version.  she was brought the 6 ounce instead.  hmmmm.  our server may have tried to impress with her memory skills instead of writing down our order.  that was a mistake.  besides messing up the wine order she also screwed up one of the salad requests.  dressing was ordered on the side.  it wasnt.  when we remarked on it she didnt offer to correct it.  she just said, dressing is already on the salad.. no apologies.  my wedge with blue cheese was refreshing.  and the complimentary rolls were marvelous.  my partner ordered the beer can chicken which came with a side of mac and cheese.  both quite tasty.  although the latter was too garlicky for my taste.  i ordered a ribeye this is billed as a steak house afterall with a side of broccoli with cheese sauce.  a major disappointment.  both were blander than bland.  and the entrees were delivered while we were still working on the salads.  so that high top table got real crowded.  the tasteless steak was cooked to my medium rare specification.  but someone needs to let the kitchen staff know that they need to let the water drain from the veggies before adding the cheese sauce.  that dish looked horrible with the broccoli drowning in the watered down cheese soup.  the pricing is right and ill wait a few weeks before returning so that the kitchen staff can get their act together.  for a steakhouse they need to improve if theyre going to compete with the likes of bob taylors or the charcoal room.

overall:  a good, but not great experience.  the food was generally above average. the ahi appetizer was poor, it was obviously frozen, tough and extremely salty.  my wife enjoyed the bbq pork nachos.  my ny strip was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were adequate.  the other entrees were fine.  the major issue here is the service.  our waitress, anjanette, was busting her butt moving between her tables, but seemed a bit frazzled.  it appears they are understaffed, as waits for some of the items and refills were excessive, even when the dining room was half empty.  they might want to up the number of servers.  we will probably give this place another try.
the wait was too long, over promised wait time. the bread was really good! the food was average. i got the tri tips and mashed potatoes. the flavor was plain. they seemed stingy on the bread and would not get us more. if the flavors were better and the bread was constant this place would have been 4 to 5 stars.
ill start off by saying the service was good. my husband ordered the porterhouse steak medium rare..when it came to the table it was so over cooked that i know for a fact the cow was dead. had to send it back. i ordered the smothered chicken with mac and cheese. chicken was good. mac n cheese not so much after i added salt and pepper it was better.. son ordered kids cheeseburger...cant really mess up a basic slider..my martini was delicious though..overall i will stick with bob taylors ranch house for our steak cravings..love that place!
megan was very attentive and the saladsandwich rates looked competitive.   we had an issue with one order but the manager quickly rectified it.  the kids chicken fingersfries were a good portion.   the bread was excellent.   french onion soup was salty and no one was at the front to greet until 3 min after we arrived.
im kind of impressed but kind of disappointed. i work for a major steakhouse chain and the quality of the food here was hit or miss. the salmon was cooked perfectly, the broccoli and cheese was more like broccoli and yellow water. the traditional mojito tasted like water. my dirty bleu martini was garnished with olives that were supposed to be blue cheese stuffed but i belive it was some sort of solid white eraser they stuffed into only one of the two olives. all in all i was expecting a lot better for the prices.
food was good but service was only satisfactory. i think we were the only table that didnt get served bread until we asked for it halfway through our main course. also, i never got offered a refill of my water the entire time. however, prices were decent compared to the steakhouses off the vegas strip.
we ate at the fire rock in casper wyoming it was so amazing we went to the one in vegas.   it also very good.   i tried to make a reservation for our annual christmas party.,however the manager was only willing to make a reservation after 830 pm what a disappointment we we willing to drive the 40 minutes to get there from our side of the city but he didnt care at all about our business.  maybe he just doesnt care.
the food was ok with my dish, but my boyfriends was better. my boyfriend had the ribeye excellent. my prime rib was dry and cold but tasty. our server sabatian was fast, quick and no personality. very loud place. but it is a causal classy bar atmosphere.
we didnt have reservations....so we sat on the bar area.   first and foremost angelia was a wonderful waitress! she was talking to a couple next to us who ate majority of their meal and said were not paying for it?!? she had checked on them and yet they insisted on making a scene... they talked to the manager not sure what he said to them and they walked out without paying... they had alcohol drinks with their meal... who got stuck with the bill the poor waitress!!! so when she came over to us she was obviously shaken up!   we had a coupon from being a frequent customer for free appetizer... we got the sampler.. calamari  and spinach dip were delicious, the stuff mushrooms were luke warm.. bread was stale and overall just mediocre. the food runner brought out the appetizer and meal within a minute of each other..we decided to split the southwest sandwich?!?  what a disappointment... shreddedchopped chicken.  we enjoy trying different items on the menu and like having this neighborhood restaurant.  spoke to the manager to let him know the people were assholes... the waitress still has to pay for that meal... some people are jerks!!!    people who do you think pays for this?!? not the restaurant the wait staff!
my wife and i, our son and his girl friend all went to try fire rock at about 6:00 on friday night. we knew that it would be rush hour and expected the 20 minute wait time. they have a nice system where you give them your phone number and they text you when your table is ready.when we got seated, we were immediately greeted by rick, our server and was served our drinks right away. we were ready to order and ordered right away. it was a busy friday night and the noise level was off the chart. there was no fresh bread and had to wait about 15 minutes for it to come out of the oven. it was warm. soft and had a great flavor, about 15 minutes later the food came out and looked great! sorry to say, the good review ends here.the fish and chips; fish had a good flavor but was a little rubbery.the pasta bowl; my son refused to review this for yelp and i think it was because it was a little bland.my wife had the dry rubbed ribs and baked potato. the ribs were dry and slightly tough. they had a nice smokey flavor, and the half rack proportion was generous. the potato was only cooked thoroughly on one side. and was hard and inedible on the other. i had the chicken and biscuit w mashed potatoes. the flavor was kick ass and the potatoes were very tasty. the biscuit was a piece of toast? and certainly not a biscuit. that was disappointing.one last thing, you would think that a a place that charges as much as 49 for an entree would have filtered tap water. the chlorine taste was unmistakable.unfortunately, it didnt end there. our waiter was forced to wait on so many tables, it took 15 minutes to get our check. i felt bad for rick and still left him my normal 20 tip. i will try this place again in a few months and see if it improves once they lose enough business to handle the rest.
ive been here twice now. both times the food was fairly good. i have no complaints. but both times it felt like they are still trying to get there sea legs so to speak. both times there were issues with getting my order right and getting good prompt customer service. i think once they get a handle on that they will be a much better establishment. ive had soup twice, salads both times, a burger, and the calamari. the food isnt fabulous. its good but not fabulous. so 3 stars for now, 4 stars if you get the service up to par, and 5 stars if you get the food a little better. ultimately it is like a high end chain restaurant. give it a chance. you might like it.
four stars for the food. two stars for the length of time there. first we walked in to no one waiting and was told its going to be 510 mins. tons of open tables, so automatic one star reduction for this. once seated we ordered right away. our salads and soups came out fairly quick. the our server tells us the printer ran out of paper during our order and what was it again. so now we wait for three steaks. that took a while. no comp, no free dessert on us. the food was great. just expected more on the service.
this is a very good place. food and pricing are great but place is loud and too casual for a quality steak  place and too many crying kids brings atmosphere down a bit. definitely come here again but not expect an upscale environment next time.
drinks on point, service on point, cleanliness on point...but my monte cristo was not yummy and my french onion soup was so so salty in burned my throat... but my server was bartending and serving at the same time and was doing a killer job juggling both and always smiled when eye contact was made!  seriously this chick rocks!!!  i think her name was steinna... it was 10192015 at 12:20pm. awesome service!!!
been reading a lot of reviews and wanted to check it out for ourselves. we sat at the bar and had excellent customer service. i ordered the the centennial special which was a sirloin special that came with a salad, side and desert. desert has to be creme brulee or cheesecake. salad was good, had egg on it, too much dressing, steak was good, garlic mash was a little dry but after my steak came out they said they were out of creme brulee. what....  couldnt tell me that when i ordered. a little disappointment. so make sure to ask before you ordered. i dont like cheesecake so i got it to go to give to someone.
our first visit and it was ok. the dinner rolls were very good. i ordered the calamari as an appetizer, not bad, but ive had better. i ordered the sirloin special for dinner, it was 18 for salad, steak and potato and desert, cant beat it. the salad wasnt anything special, the steak and potato were done just right and delicious, and i ordered the cream brulee sp? for desert, it wasnt what i expected. it was cold with a hard shell of sugar on top...not sure if thats what it was supposed to be. hubby had the cajun steak, which he very much enjoyed. overall, the experience was ok. the food didnt taste like it was made to order, even tho they kept reminding us that it was. i will recommend it for the good steak, but i think thats it.
weve been here a couple of times and i dont think there is anything exceptional about it.  menu selection is good.  however, the northwest is very underserved and its nice to have a decent restaurant in the area.  food seems a little processed and very salty.  staff is very well trained and good so it makes up a little for the b  food.
ive been patiently waiting to try this new steak and seafood joint since they opened. after not being able to get reservations for the times i wanted i decided i would try lunch. the restaurant on a week day was practically dead. our waitress was friendly and my daughter ordered the chicken finger kids meal while i tried the short rib pasta. we also got the philly cheese steak egg rolls to start. the egg rolls were deliciously hearty and full of flavor. my daughter loved the 3 chicken fingers they gave her, very small portion even for a kid. as for the noodle dish i ordered, it was disappointing. the broth that subs as a sauce is very bland and the meat from the short ribs tastes more like a beef stew. i was looking more for that rich fatty flavor usually associated with short ribs. that flavor was boiled or stewed out of this dish. the noodles were ok, at least they werent overcooked. the final nail in the coffin for this place was the length of time it took to get our check and pay for it. for a place that was clearly not busy at all, this is unacceptable. i waited 20 minutes to get my check and probably another 10 minutes waiting to get my card back. i was hoping id found a new fine dining option closer to home but this place did not cut it.
first time this place opened my friend and i went. we were very excited and it was kind of dissapointing. the service was barely there and the food was okay. we decided to give this place a second chance and they definetly stepped their game up!! guess they just needed to break the place in, it didnt dissapoint. great atmosphere it was pack. my favorite drink is the habeneiro margarita. the service definetly got better also, would definitely eat here again.
recently located to centennial hills.. the place is really well laid out and convenient location.. i was very dissapointed with the full rack of ribs to go order.. very lacking in flavor and lots of grit and stuff other than rib bone... it was a busier than normal sunday dec 13th 2015, approx noon time and there was not enough staff on duty... i will give this place several more shots but will avoid the ribs...
nice ambiance. cute interior. not crazy  rowdy at all : only 3 stars because everything is kind of bland and not extraordinary. my dad and i were driving through and i wish we went somewhere else for a better experience... server was nice but none of the workers really tried to make us feel at home. the favorite part was the bread that was brought to the table!
i took a long time to arrive at this review and this rating, and it comes down to this: to date, two of three drinks have been disappointing.i was ready to give dutch bros glowing praise after my first visit. they provided plenty of free drinks and friendly service on their grand opening day. employees covered the long lines by the walkup window, in the drivethru line, and even in the curbside queue across the street. i chose a small caramelizer freeze blended drink and i enjoyed it immensely. it was similar to the caramel frappuccino at starbucks, but the flavor was richer while the sweetness wasnt overpowering.weeks later, i went for my second visit. i didnt feel like taking on as much caffeine or sugar, so i opted for the medium iced chai latte 3.75. the flavor was roughly what you would expect, but it was lighter and waned more quickly than i would have liked. i was starting to doubt dutch bros after this visit, and i decided that i would need a third visit to make my decision.that third trip was today. i was low on energy, meaning that another coffee drink would be perfect. i went to the otherwiseempty drivethru lane, and an employee was already leaning out the window ready to speak to my order. a conversation led to her recommending the offmenu snickers mocha, and i decided to get a large cup of the iced version 4.75.sadly, it didnt meet expectations. to call it a snickers drink is definitely stretching belief. even on the first gulp, the peanut flavor was a small accent at best. it was overpowered by the chocolate and coffee. also, while the first half of this drink provided a pickmeup, thats to be expected with the caffeine and sugar. it kinda plateaued through the second half, which is unfortunate because a recent coffee experience elsewhere had me hoping for a bigger boost.there are plenty of things to like, but theyre all secondary to the product. friendly service can only go so far, and stamp cards or comparable rewardsincentives are not unique. i really wanted to give them brownie points for the 247 availability, but i cant imagine many college students finding that helpful because of the lack of indoor seating. their presence in an otherwise coffeedeficient neighborhood is welcome, but why factor that in when most people dont live or work close enough for it to be convenient?ill probably give dutch bros an occasional visit since im often in the area, but i dont see whats bringing the seemingly endless crosstown visits and rave reviews. this certainly isnt the best coffee that ive had in las vegas, and im not willing to go out of my way even though its 15 minutes at most from home. lastly, it might be a marginally better chain than starbucks, and it only has one location here so far, but its still a chain.
great staff and product! i love the customer service from the cashier at the walk up window. she needs credit because i watched her socialize with every customer. great girl. the only issue is that i think they need a cute matching uniform for the whole staff... and one of the girls was wearing flip flops. and, they all need to be wearing gloves. im a big health code person, so every time i go out to eat i try to keep my standards low because at my own 5 stores i have health inspections every 612 months and pass with as. other then those issues; my husband always go there to get drinks for his whole morning crew at work, so he will continue to go because its cheaper than starbucks, and the quality is just as good !!
i ordered the 911 coffee drink and now im currently writing this review from the restroom. at least i dont have to hit the gym today. i was finally in the area and decided to stop by see what all the buzz is about surrounding dutch bros. first off, wow they are busy, the drivethru line was all the way into the street and yet the walkup window was completely deserted so i parked and walkedup... im not a big fan sweet coffee, do you have any drinks not loaded with whipped cream or syrup? i asked, umm sure, try the 911. its an intense blend of irish cream and six shots of espresso. reciting the menu verbatim, love it... large or small? i said large not knowing that the larges here are like movie theater sizes, holy shit, 12oz of coffee will do just fine not twoliters. i took a sip and yes this thing was very sweet, but the six shots of espresso took away some of the sweetness and also loosened something in my colon from last thanksgiving. wow, thank goodness i was headed home. the drink was good, but not great. i hate to sound like coffee snob here, but i like my drinks a little more refined. these are just plain caffeinated drinks loaded with tons of sugar and given corny names, for example, the annihilator, the kicker and my personal favorite the double torture. this place fits vegas perfect its gimmicky, everything is oversized and theres no depth just tons of flash to distract you from the subpar beverage in your hand.   dutch bros. you belong on the strip.
with so many highly raved reviews and the high star rating, i knew that i just had to give dutch bros a try. so one morning, i went out of my way to go in the morning right before work. i got there maybe around 7:20a7:30a and it was pretty empty. there wasnt a long line or anything so i just went straight ahead! the girl at the window was really nice and really bright on an early weekday morning. i decided to go with their kicker, which is the original silky blend of irish cream. as i was waiting for the drink, the girl started a light conversation with me, which is nice. she gave me a stamp card and i believe she gave me an extra stamp since it was my first time. once i got my drink, i took a sip of it to see what its like. she told me that if i didnt like it, i could have it remade. well, unfortunately, i was already almost late to work so i had to get going. as for the drink itself, it reminded me of a melted starbucks frappuccino  sweet enough for me to have cavities. i can appreciate a sugary drink once in a while but that day was not the day. im not sure if ill be able to give dutch bros another try mainly because it is out of the way for me and on top of it, its just not my type of product. im sure their product is great for some people but i just cant deal with overly sweet coffee. however, their coffee base should be decent. if i do get to try them again, ill definitely ask for less sugar .. maybe even no sugar. if you are using an irish cream, i fail to see why you need to add more sugar to the drink.
so this is the new, fancy place in plazamidwood.  we took our family there last night and it was good, but some friendly advice:  it needs some work.so first of all: yes, we liked it.  the service was nice and the decor was really cool.  of course, i have to add, the decor was nice of what we could see of it.  it was so dark, i had to use my phones flashlight to see the menu and our six year old son disappeared to another table because we couldnt see him.  even after adjusting for 10 minutes, it was so dark, we couldnt really see each other.  i can see the point of a grown up pub being this dark later in the evening.  but i cant imagine trying to eat lunch here.  i had the workmans friend cocktail and really liked it.  i dont like sweet drinks and this one was perfectly tart, sour, and a bit sweet.we had the pickled okra to begin and like it a lot.  both twins gobbled it up.i had the fish and chips great and generous thick fish which was good.  the chips were not so exciting.  my husband and 11 year old son devoured the burgers and were quite happy.  my twin son had the irish american grilled cheese and loved it.  our twin daughter order the  kid friendly mac and cheese and it was so small when it arrived, she started to cry. shes only six but the presentation and just the amount they gave her was pitiful. we had to special order another grilled cheese, which they brought out pronto with apologies.  im guessing not a lot of families have come yet, which they are going to have to deal with because plazamidwood families take their families to pubs.  we dont need a special kids menu of fried chicken fingers.  our kids eat real meals.  but some acknowledgement of the neighborhoods family friendliness would be great.i think this is going to be a topnotch place. im looking forward to going back and trying more items.
i was super excited when i found out a new restaurant was opening in plaza midwood, i live in the neighborhood so i always love it when we get new places. after it had been opened for a few weeks we stopped in for lunch on a sunday afternoon. the atmosphere is pretty cool, def. has a pub vibe to it. there was no one at the front so we sort of just stood there for a minute until the bartender told us to wait one second and he would get someone, we then were told by the person who came next to wait for the next person. this was really no big deal there just seemed to be a lot of confusion among employees. the menu itself is really small, and sadly there are only 2 vegetarian options. i should have expected this i guess with it being pub style but still i was disappointed. i ordered the grilled cheese with tomato bisque and also the mac  cheese for a side. all in all i was really not impressed, the grilled cheese was very bland and extremely greasy. the tomato soup was not very good, i love basil a lot but this was way too much basil for my personal taste. there was basil in the soup as well as an oil on top that i mixed in and it was too overwhelming for me to finish eating. the mac  cheese was so so, my husband enjoyed it more than me. based off of the food i really dont have any interest in going back but perhaps i would stop by here for a drink some time.
mussels were good, service was not. ill give this place another go though. maybe it was just an off night for our server.
we stopped in here for lunch and an early one at that so i knew the staff might be a bit groggy but they actually stepped up nicely and took care of business.the entrees we had which ive now forgotten were obviously fine or i would have remembered most likely.  the interior has a nice cozy feel to it and i see this place more like a night spot than anything else.  it is a sister restaurant of dandelion and you can kind of tell by the nature of the space and the layout of the menu, etc.the parking is around the back and thats a nice touch considering parking in this particular area of charlotte is hard to find.
before my favorite churrascaria opened, i used to go here. although its cheaper here and theyre open for lunch everyday and they have goat cheese at the salad bar, the service and food quality is marginal. they have the usual brazilian bbq salad bar items such as smoked salmon, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, cheeses, olives, salami, beans and rice etc. they give you pao de queijo, fried bananas and mashed potatoes. the meats include chicken, beef, pork, sausage and lamb. ive tried their key lime pie, cheesecake, flan and chocolate mousse all of which were just ok.the gaucho guys seem to take longer going around and when i come to a churrascaria, i come famished...waiting cannot happen. they seem careless too. id have blood oil meat juice drip next to my plate or my arm! obrigadinha!out of the churrascarias in vegas. fdc on flamingo is 1 on my list, tdb is 2, vb in summerlin is 3...and that p place in planet hollywood? forget it!
texas de brazil is an award wining brazilian steakhouse restaurant. the various cuts of meats are never disappointing and are always hot. this place is wonderful to host a dinner a party, because everyone can find something they love; between the salad bar, the soup bar, the meats, and dessert this place is surely a crowd pleasure. however, i will say that this place can become very crowded and you must submit the exact number of people in your party, because if you must add an additional person at the last minute, this restaurant is not willing to accommodate the change. lastly, if you are celebrating a special event, make sure you keep any birthday cakes, balloons, rings, or any special celebration enhancements with you as they will charge you a 15.00 holding fee which i have never heard of before in my life, but they do. so, i now know that in future when i wish to celebrate a special event with this restaurant, i know that i will not ask them to hold my cake for me.
positives: a lot of space, friendly baristas, cool ambiance, love the couches and comfy chairs, big work tables, good panini. negatives: my latte wasnt hot enough somewhere between latte and gibraltarcortado tempthis is an odd occurrence for me as i order lattes often when trying out new coffee places and cant remember the last time ive gotten one that wasnt steamed enough; price higher than expected: 22 for two 12oz lattes and two panini; no prepared breakfast food. verdict: great to meet a group but probably not a new favorite for an everyday coffee shop. given that its only been a little while since opening, i may try it again in a few weeks and update my review.
so do you know that one song by eminem named stan? well if you dont, its about a fan who really loves slim shady, but keeps getting disappointed because he doesnt get a response from slim. at the end of the song stan drives of a bridge. i love ritual coffee, its delicious! go here if you love delicious coffee. go here if you love a cool i am going to get on my fixed gear, and ride into the sun type of vibe. in fact, i think you really should go here, because its a solid coffee shop. the negation of two stars is as such: it might have been the day, but the barista with the tattoos probably doesnt narrow it down must have been sitting on something large and pretentious. we got attitude, we got a lecture, we got subtle scoffs, and now you hipsterella get 3 stars. they dont even act like that in the real ritual coffee house in san francisco!all in all, im definitely going to go here again, i highly suggest you do to. i was just perturbed by princessess behavior. cue the dido.....
love the atmosphere!  from the art on the walls, furnishings, tables, and chairs, to the menu boards, coffee memorabilia, and nooks and hidden room or two?, i found this coffeeshop very inviting!  what i didnt appreciate were the tiny flies hanging out in the pastry section of the front corner.  i was particularly hungry and was looking for something sweet to pair with the latte id ordered along with the apple pie cortado.  aaron, the barista who took care of my two drink orders today, apologized profusely about the fly situation.  he tried to get the two pastry covers that were stacked together to pry apart, but it was no use...  aussie pies were also not available today. http:www.yelp.combiz_photosmaverickcoffeescottsdale?selectxr6g0zl6ic6oord3lxmqw  i heard someones order of a panini being ready for pickup, so theres that to look into on my next visit.  probably not something i could order, but its nice to know that there are many food options available for those who do not have food allergies and insensitivities to contend with!  i also spotted bags of granola available for purchase, as well as one readymade cup of yogurt and cutup fruit with a quartercup side of granola in the cold case along with bottles of soda and juices.  fortunately, the beverages i ordered were interesting enough by themselves.  was the easyontheeyes apple pie cortado delicious? http:www.yelp.combiz_photosmaverickcoffeescottsdale?selectpsff5uqqnxyt78y4yfi4hg  with a spice base blend of cinnamon, allspice, and brown sugar, a presta fiesta singleorigin espresso 2 oz., steamed whole milk 3 oz., and a maple candy crumble and a wedge of honey crisp apple wedge as garnishes, why, yes, but would i order it again?  maybe, but not until ive tried everything else there is to try here.  maverick may not have swept me off my feet from the very beginning like chandlers peixoto did, the atmosphere here alone is worthy of another visit.  perhaps it was the lackluster coffee art that adorned my 16 oz. latte that turned me off... after seeing how pretty the apple pie cortado came out i assumed it was aaron who made it, but perhaps it was ashleys creation?, i expected a cool design on the latte. http:www.yelp.combiz_photosmaverickcoffeescottsdale?selectrd9qxwvhkd_nhm2nideba  im assuming he did both drinks, since he asked me if they were for takeout, or for here?  i asked if i could get coffee art for both if i decided to take them togo, and he yes for the latte, but that he didnt suggest taking the cortado togo, so i decided to just drink them at the coffeeshop.  fyi, the milks, or at least the cows milks, offered here arent organic, nor even local.  another reason why i fell hard for peixoto!  since i spotted yelp photos with captions including almond milk and honey, im assuming maverick offers these two, although i did not see any honey jars or teddy bear bottles lying around.  i did spot packets of raw turbinado sugar and stevia in the raw on the table with all the napkins, straws, and cup lids and jackets.ill be back again to try another coffee beverage, or perhaps an iced tea.  and next time, ill make sure to carve out some reading time to enjoy the atmosphere here!
coffee and pastries are great...until i just saw the barista pick his nose while steaming milk...uh if i get sick i wont come back i guess.
decent food, cute inside. prices way too high for portions. ordered calamari for app and got about 5 strips. you can pay the same amount and get quadruple the portion and tastes just as good at rehab burger downtown. also ordered fish and chips...11.99 for 2 pieces of fish and a bunch of fries. seemed more like 11.99 for a bunch of shoe string fries.
great food but they need sun shades. its hard to enjoy 30 worth of tacos with the sun in your eyes
i liked this place.  the ambiance is very industrial.  the location is good.  the service was very good.  the mint lemonade is over priced and just okay.  no free refills for 3.25.  the waffle dog was just okay.  the sausage was good but it just tasted like a pancake or something wrapped around it.  the wolf pack with corned beef instead of bacon and swiss cheese was good.  my least favorite part was the hash browns.  i liked that they were crispy on the outside but they must have been a little to thick or something because they were mushy inside.i would like to go back and try the banana brioche french toast.
i dont really get the hype over this place. i went to the arcadia location once and the sound of people yelling across the table to the people they were eating with was so distracting that was all i could remember. so when this tempe location opened up i thought id give over easy another chance. but i dunno, you guys. it just wasnt anything special.i do like the location, although its very small  only a handful of tables  its nice and bright and clean. i ordered eggs and bacon with sweet potato tots. my boyfriend got pancakes with eggs and bacon. are we just ordering the wrong thing? is there something really great that we are missing out on? our food wasnt bad per se, it just wasnt anything special. my eggs were fine, the bacon was average and the tots were, well, warmed up out of bag...and my boyfriend said his pancakes were a little dry...so...yeah. we both walked out feeling sort of meh about the whole experience.with all the new breakfast places now available in tempe i dont think over easy is going to make it into our regular rotation. i hate to say it over easy, but im over you.
ive been to this location a few times now and it was worth going back to, although nothing worth writing home about. one thing did really bother me though. read below. likes: great atmosphere, basic breakfast items, reasonable prices. dislikes: pumpkin french toast is too sweet and mushy, normal problems with service that will come with any new restaurant but i wouldnt hold that against them until they are a few months into it. here is what really bothered me though. they advertise their pancakes and french toast as coming with real maple syrup. anyone who knows real maple syrup knows how big of a difference that makes and how rare it is to get that. i grew up with real maple syrup know how much better it makes pancakes or french toast. i ordered french toast and confirmed with my waitress that it came with real maple syrup. as soon as i got my french toast and real maple syrup i knew the consistency was wrong.  it had a little bit of the right taste but not the real thing. i was extremely disappointed. then my suspicions were confirmed when i saw another waiter pouring syrup into the containers that they serve at the table. he was mixing two different syrups. 30 real maple syrup and the rest cheap crappy corn syrup.  they are lying on their menus and its not okay.
i have gone here twice and had two very different experiences.the first time i went was when they first opened. this place allows you to sit where you want and has a very laid back atmosphere. the decor is the mix of industrial with a classic kitchen twist. the tap water isnt the best so make sure you get a good drink while you are there. the cold brew is a little expensive for the price, the assorted juices were a better choice for us. the food seems very hit or miss. the first time we went, we had the chicken fried steak, biscuits and reeses pieces pancakes. all of the food was absolute perfection. the second time we went, we had the eggs benedict and the ham steak as well as the biscuits. the biscuits this time were very dry and didnt resemble the ones we had on opening weekend. im not sure if they changed the recipe or if its a new cook but i was a little disappointed. the eggs benedict had a very different sauce than what ive had on eggs benedict before. it was very bland and also disappointing. lastly, my fiance had egg shells left in his eggs, which was unpleasant.i would love to give this place a higher rating but i think the food quality has gone down. im hoping that it was just an off day because i did love their food. if you are going to try anything get the chicken fried steak for sure.
i did notice a few people eating the mixed wok pot that one of the reviewers mentioned. i think ill need to try that next time. in the meantime, the reason behind my middle of the road rating is this; in a nut shell, i was craving a good predinner snack, so i ordered one of my favourite simple and easy chinesegotos: sliced bbq pork with rice and in this case it came with two over easy fried eggs, plus some broccoli and some splashes of soy  i assume  sauce. the issue was the thick meaty slices of meat in the photo were not what arrived. what i received was very fatty and much thinner than the slices pictured. it was so different that i presented it to the server and then the managerowner. after a friendly back and forth discussion, he diligently returned my plate to the kitchen. a little while later he pleasantly returned it with a better looking selection of slices. not to the level of the photo, but definitely an improvement. it turned out to be flavourful, and with eggs over rice became pretty darn filling. the one other issue was the broccoli became stone cold. i needed my greens, so i ate them, but would have been nicer, if warmed up. ironically a guy at the next table had ordered the same thing his was even thicker and meatier than even my replacement, so hmm  the reason i was given for the fat, and this may explain the two other dishes is that they started cutting from the edge of a new piece and the fat, gave way to more meaty slices as they kept slicing inwards. if so, they should try to keep the plates looking relatively the same, or change the photo to match the average portion supplied.overall, this place reminded me of certain chinese quick serve places id seen in my travels, neat, modern and enticing. as i began my review, now im really craving that mixed wok pot.
i wanted to love this place more than i did. ive had bubble tea in asia before and took a special detour to try it. the person serving was sat on her phone when i came in and wasnt that helpful when i asked questions on the different options available. the menu is quite large with most things available hot, cold or iced. then you have the choice to add pearls etc, how much sugar you want to add and how much ice you want. there is such a lot of choice that i wanted some help with the options. i dont normally have sugar in tea but i do in chai so i went for the lowest level of sugar and still found it too sweet for me. there is some seating by the window on bar stools and a larger area at the back of the store but it only has one sofa and one other seat so its there isnt much seating. they advertise free wifi but i couldnt get connected to it. ill probably come back on a rare sunny edinburgh day and get bubble tea to go sit in the sun and pretend im on holiday but i dont think ill be here regularly.
i dont know why there are two listings for this gym on yelp. makes it look like its rated higher than it deserves. as you can tell, im not too happy with this gym. as a new member im not impressed and i dont envision staying here long term. its poorly run. i see the manager of the gym in gym shorts working out more than i see him in a shirt and tie. equipment is left everywhere. thats quite frustrating when youre in the flow of a workout. the trainers there dont even look like they workout i dont know about you, but if im going to shell out money for a trainer, hed better look like he takes his own advice., or that they really put much effort into training their clients. they look more interested in chatting with their clients than actually making them work. i actually like the indian bend location better. its just too far from my house to be my regular gym. maybe the folks at desert ridge will actually read these reviews and use them to improve.... who am i kidding??
i would give it a 3.5 stars... the food was pretty good, the plates are huge! not sure if i liked it or not... and the cocktail i had was delicious. the service, however, was pretty slow and inconsistent. the cocktail arrived after the food has, and both took too long. we were served by few waitresses so no one exactly took care of us  was aware of our needs throughout the meal. also, the check arrived before we asked for it even thought its a 24h restaurant, so we didnt really feel like taking a look at desserts or anything. all in all  its a good place for you if youre in the area and super hungry, but i wouldnt stand in line for it if theres any or make an effort to come.
as a restaurant destination of convenience, this place is ok. an upgrade from the previous central 24. also better than bellagio cafe.this is pricey diner food. but then again youd have to assume any restaurant in the lobby of one of the most iconic and busiest hotels on the plant would be.sampled over 2 visits:chines chicken salad 4 out 5. fresh. quality ingredients.hummos starter: 3 of 5. flatbread should be better. hummos more creamier. olives were amazing.short rib nachos: great nachos. too much meat.   3 out of 5wings: 5 stars. excellent. period.sliders: weak. 1 out of 5. only flavor that stood out was the grease it was cooked on..for a late night bite or quick lunch before a tee time. this is a go.  otherwise for the money, you can do better in and around caesars and the forum shopps.
ill have to go back later on, to see if there is any variationchange it just opened two weeks ago, but for now, this new pub in griffintown is quite promising.the only reason why im giving 3 stars right now it mostly because, while the food is seriously awesome their ribs nachos...omfg!!! finally some interesting nachos!, the beer selection is limited but still good and their cocktails are...meh. i was disappointed. im not a fan of bitterdrytaste cocktails, so it might not be for me.oh, and another reason: they dont have a proper alcohol license. you absolutely need to eat something. i hope it will change later on.otherwise, a really nice pub in a really new developing and hip neighborhood. their terrasse is quite fun too.
a new dim sum place near my house so we decided to give it a try...flavor is similar to all the other places in town, nothing stand out but the dessert is not bad. i ordered the almond tea bund with lotus seed in it, light not too sweet but if you are durian lover, must try their durian rolls. overall, food is ok .
a new cantonese restaurant just opened a month ago, i went in at 11, got some dim sum, gotta say it was turned out better than rio and ping pang pong. the durian rolls were pretty good, crispy and fresh. so i got one more dish, cream custard buns are really really tasty. just one bite then yellow creamy juice just came out! and red bean jelly cakes are way better than the ones i had in england. anyway, i love it, and ill go there and get durian rolls and red bean jelly again! but but but you will not expect to see anything back in the kitchen. got it? :
first and last time coming here for dim sum..this restaurant is just recently open, located on decatur across from international market. i posted pics of the dishes i order, most of them are not good...the price is average, like all the dim sum ive eaten.. sorry ping pang pong, located inside goldcoast casino... is by far the best dim sum in vegas..
nothing special  you dont have the ladies coming around all the time to give you dim sum choices. you actually had to wave them down to get them to come by the table. overall, the items that we got were typical and nothing special. but, if you want to get your dim sum fix and youre close by, stop by and its not expensive either.
the center bar at sls casino is located smack dab in the middle of the main gaming area. i like to call the center bar the 3d ceiling cube bar. the ceiling of the bar is really neat. ive been to the center bar twice, both as a meetup spot for a girls night out. on both occasions the bar has been filled to the brim with patrons  you have to get lucky to grab a seat at this bar on a saturday night! on my first visit the center bar was accepting drink tickets and i ordered a white russian with a splash of grenadine. i half expected the bartender to refuse my request, but he obliged. merci! pro tip: theres a small lounge area next to the bar as well as an atm machine. the closest bathrooms are the ones next to umami burger.yelp 100 challenge 2015: 141
typical casino bar in the middle of the floor. this one has a super cool 3d ceiling that keeps things a little interesting though. its the first bar you encounter here, visible from the entry, and frequently gets crowded. there arent too many seats around the perimeter but they recently added a small lounge area with additional comfortable and stylish seating.personally, for about the same price, id rather venture further into the casino to monkey bar and get some ambiance and live jazz with my alcohol.
kool ceiling it took a hot minute for someone to get us started... but she was friendly  got our drinks out pretty quick. we ordered a mojito which was gross  watered down to the max...  coming from me that means its very little alcohol! stella in a bottle was nice  cold though.the decor was kool w big chairs  neat looking lamps.
i respect an independent restaurant like this going up against chipotle and smashburger, both growing giants in the fast casual scene. you dont see true fast casual seafood restaurant, so there is clearly room for this concept and ahi mahi gets it mostly right.instead of 1 piece of fish, my salmon came in two very thin pieces. thankfully neither of them were overcooked, this is a major victory. im not sure if they freshly grill the fish upon order, or they have been sitting there but freshness was on point. i didnt have to wait too long for my meal either. seasoning wise, the cajun rub could have been spicier and bolder but it was not offensive. one gripe with the fish was after cooking, it seems some clarified butter or a light butter sauce was put on the fish. i didnt like what that did to the texture. the fish was served with two sides and a piece of kindafresh grill bread.i couldnt try the coleslaw because of a nut allergy, so i went with the fries which came hot, fresh, and well seasoned. putting a slight amount of sugar in the seasoning is a page from wingstops book that i enjoyed. the organic salad basic side salad was on the small side, the home made dressing kinda reminded me of a light thousand island. all the ingredients were fresh and lively.although the fish looked like a strong portion, it really didnt fill me up. soon after i finished some local shopping i spent 2 for a large chili at wendys. i like the menu at am frish and with time these minor execution errors can be remedied. i recommend that they offer in addition to the normal menu; some sort of a larger portion, maybe a thick cut piece of fish for an upcharge. i truly prefer thicker fish and am willing to wait and pay for it. ill be back when i get burnt out from burrito bowls. 3.55
i was in the other day and had the mahi with cajun seasoning.  the fish was good but i could have done without whatever sauce they put on top for some reason.  the cole slaw didnt have enough dressing for my taste and the creamed corn was swimming in cream.  im also not wild about the iced tea coming from a machine instead of fresh brewed. the prices are reasonable and its an ok dining option but i like the other quick serve fish place in town better.
im always skeptical about fish away from water but this place surprised me. i ordered the swai white fish with java sauce. sooo yummy! moist fish, not fishy at all so you know it was as fresh as it could be, and the sauce was super tasty. i paired it with grilled zucchini and the garlic fries  both flavorful and perfectly cooked. to share with my office mates i ordered the calamari. i give it a c. not a huge fan of the balsamic drizzle and it seemed too chewy. sent it back with a coworker who went to get lunchbox herself after tasting mine and the managerowner refunded my card plus gave me a free entree card. wow! he recalled my order and shared that he thinks it was overcooked. very impressed with the customer service  all staff was very friendly wearing smiles. will absolutely be back for more than my free meal! 71815 bummed: 2nd trip  my husbands swai order was undercooked. fingers crossed we dont get sick.  went back and they credited the card and gave two free entrees. i didnt use the free entree from the other trip so now we have 3 free. might be turned off to go back
decided to try this place for something different. we both had the fried tilapia and it comes with your choice of sauce and two sides. i had the creamy garlic butter with a house salad and the spicy aioli and the garlic fries. my boyfriend had on his fried tilapia the java sauce, creamed corn and edamame. the portions were really good as we will probably split it next time. we were both expecting different batter on the fish as the batter didnt have any seasoning and there was a lot of it on the fish. the sauce that was on my fish i thought was going to be more of a buttery sauce but its like gravy! i didnt see that part on the menu when i ordered. dont think ill get that sauce again. my hot fish was sitting on my salad so it made my salad wilt. the fries were awesome and the salad that was not under the hot fish was good. i dont think we will get anything fried again as we didnt like the batter. my boyfriend didnt really rave about his lunch so im not sure how he felt about all of it as a whole. the restaurant was very nice and clean. we will for sure try it again though but just try something else.
build out was done very well!  clean place with cool decor.  menu was done well and its a little confusing at first but its really cool the way you can choose your own fish sauce sides.had the fried tilapia and it was just ok.  tons of breading to work through to find the fish.  will be back but wont go for anything fried again.  on the upside there was plenty of it, couldnt even finish the whole thing.
ordered the fried tilapia with garlic butter sauce, plus cream corn and rice. the fish had barely any flavor to it  it seemed almost like they didnt even season it with salt? the batter was tasteless too, though maybe that was my fault for ordering fried fish instead of grilled. cream corn was yummy, the rice was just rice. decor was nice, the place was clean, and the staff was friendly. would try again, ordering grilled fish instead.
i really wish the salmon was wild caught and not farm raised. id even be willing to pay a little more to have it as an option.  if you going for healthy, offer the healthiest option!
i work right in the area and it is very convenient. i have tried their salads a couple times, but i am disappointed they dont offer croutons and seems many of the toppings are add ons for a premium price. i get an amazing grilled chicken salad with 4 other toppings elsewhere in the area for less  so for my salad cravings i have chosen not to go here. they do have a great pasta dish! i would avoid the muffins, i tried a bite of one and ended up just throwing it out because it was dry and the taste was not at all satisfying. i have yet to try their smoothies, again due to the nickel and dime price structure they have with the base price already being high. the owner seems to always be there and works hard which is nice to see. best of luck to this place, still could use some adjusting in a few areas.
stopped in here for lunch...positives:  service was friendly and the food was good.  the roasted vegetables were simple, but delicious.negatives:  for not being busy at all on a monday, waited quite a while for a sandwich.  ended up spending 13 for an eggplant parm sandwich and a small side of vegetables... not a whole lot for the price.
im on a mission to try all of the juice bars in the area and see how they stack up against each other! id say that while bowl of greens wasnt the worst, it wasnt the best either. i wasnt super impressed, but also wasnt totally dissatisfied.they had a note up explaining that the staff was still learning so that was a good heads up. they did a good job for being new, but i didnt feel welcomed. they were talking to each other, took my order pretty quickly but didnt talk to me at all which was a tad disappointing as i was the only customer in there at the time. also i didnt really like how it looked inside, but thats just my personal preference, it doesnt matter, the things they serve are most important!my favorite thing about bowls of greens is was that you could see them juicing the vegetables. i wouldve liked to see more variety in the juices though. i went for the bone strengthening one which was carrot, ginger, kale, and apple. i could pretty much only taste the carrot and the ginger. i wish they wouldve offered it over ice too, tasted much better after i refrigerated it. but everything was fresh and not too terribly expensive so i cant complain!
the spinach and avocado salad was delicious but tiny! they were out of strawberries, no problem because they had a wide selection. adding chicken was 2.00  sum total of 11 and some change. for that price i wish my salad was double the size. im still hangry bowl of greens
update after a phone call from matt, we were both able to explain our positions. turns out a manager has to approve any refunds or, in my case, exchanges.  i went in today and was able to exchange my product and was treated to a free shake. disaster averted.popped in yesterday to get a shake and decided to grab a jar of black out59.95. i stop in there 12 times a week for a shake.  when i opened it last night, the powder was clumped together like rocks and the scoop was almost cemented into the block of what used to be powder at the bottom. i have purchased many, many powdered products that have sometime ended up with a little humidity inside after packing but this was severe.  i tried to break up the clumps but they were too rough. i went in today to get a postworkout shake and do a swap on the product.  while i was chatting with a sales person, he mentioned that this was a known issue with some of the osn, one stop nutrition, products.  i picked up and shook about six different canisters of black out before i could find one that didnt sound like a can of rocks. he referred me to another sales person and thats when i was met with an unbelievable scenario. the sales person had to call his manager to see what to do and the manager, identified as matt, not only declined to do the swap but wanted me to come back later in the day so he could see it for himself.  i explained that i wasnt in a position to return later today and that id gladly leave the spoiled product for the manager to inspect if they would replace it with a fresh product.  i was denied. at this time, i have to give one stop nutrition on bell road and the manager, matt, only one star and i recommend being very careful shopping there. clearly they dont stand behind their products and at those price points, thats unsettling.
i really really wanted to give them a 4 star rating but the food is the star and it wasnt even close to that so like 3.3 rating i guess. im basically rating this a 3 because of a couple things. ayce sushi is one of my favorite things to eat and i always order the same things i would get at other establishments and compare them to each other. i feel like everything here is covered in eel sauce or yum yum or ponzu here. its not a bad thing but its also not a good thing. i really like those flavors but when every dish seem to taste the same it gets boring. rice doesnt stay together on the nigiri and thats a big no no. the fish quality was ok it wasnt the best. i also think that the people that are working here need to be a little more educated on sushi we asked the waitress if she knew what deep fried shrimp heads were and she acted like we were crazy to mention it like what is that? lol kinda funny but i think they have the location to get the people in but i think there are many other sushi places that are way better than this place. oh i will say my favorite thing here was the salmon skin handroll.
ayce. very slow.. i was the only customer and literally the each order came out past 7 to 9 minutes apart and i was already half full on 3rd order, usually i dont order many at a time cause i hate to waste food but this place, but if i have to go back, will order as many as i can in first order. the server was nice guy but forgot my , salmon roe roll, tuna roll.the worst thing of last visit was uncooked pork cheese roll.
well let me just say first that i would have like to give sushi way 4 stars based on the food, but it had to many other hang ups keeping me from giving it the 4 star rating. my wife, family, and i love to eat sushi. we usually find ourselfs in vegas 1 to 2 times a year. when we come to vegas we usually eat sushi at least 2 times during our stay. we usually look look on yelp for new ayce sushi restaurants. this trip we tried island sushi, and sushi way. island sushi was a great experience. when i found sushi way it had limited reviews, but the pictures looked great. we decided to go ahead and give it a try.when we sat we were the only customers there. we put in our order very quickly. the appetizers came out pretty quick,and were very tasty. sushi on the other hand was a different story. there was only one sushi cutter. more customers started to arrive. the sushi cutter looked like he was off in outer space. there was no sense of urgency. there was a 60 min time cap when eating. we were there for 2 and half hours.im guessing they let us go over the time limit because it was taking 10 mins in between half orders rolls.sometimes when i would look at the cutter,  he would just be starring at the wall as orders were piling up. maybe he was just ovetwhelmed, either way its made for a bad experiance. about 2 hours into lunch another sushi cutter comes frantically running in. it wasnt till he arrived that sushi started coming out.also the waiter and waitresses would walk away as you were trying to order. they would say that they had your order down as they walked away, however they would either forget items of bring out wrong items. food was 4 stars, service was 1 star. i decided to go with 3 over all stars. all negative critique aside i will give it another try. if the service is corrected i see 5 star potential.
service was meh. server got a lot of things wrong every time we ordered. i can understand that he was busy though the fish was great though. all the rolls and fish worked out well
this experience went 1000 real quick.when we got there the place wasnt crazy busy. we got seated right away and the servers were genuinely super nice and on top of things!the rolls were decent, we tried the following:rollstigershrimp loverfreaky fridaybaked salmonspiderhot and juicylisa hand rollappetizerscucumber crab saladseaweed saladscreaming orgasmsweet and spicy potstickerstempura calamaridessertstrawberry mochi duhlike i said the rolls were decent but im sad to say we will not be returning due to the horrendous wait time to receive rolls.there was a time we waited 28 minutes for a roll. i get they only had two sushi chefs but there were times when we saw rolls waiting for ten plus minutes to be picked up and taken to tables. its unfair to blame the chefs when theyre doing their job.
thank goodness, a place that finally had the sense to separate the sushi, the ginger and the wasabi!! i hate wasabi! and i find that anytime i order sushi, at least one piece is always tainted by that strong and painful wasabi flavor, due to it being placed in that same container. yuck!i ordered a philly roll and a fried philly roll, both of which were very standard. not extraordinary but good. would i go back? yes but my search for the best sushi spot that is reasonably close continues.
my husband and i had ayce option and the food wasnt bad nor good. the food was kinda bland to me, especially those with garlic or ponzu sauce has no flavors. it needs a little kick to it. they do have big portions of fish on the nigiri though and cooked items are not bad either.  on the other hand, the service wasnt quite there, they need more uplifting spirited ppl working there. waiters was kinda ehhh....its not good for a start up business and the layout or lighting was not welcoming, it felt cold but hope all is well for this business . oh lastly , they said fresh oysters on the menu wasnt fresh at all... it smelled like rotten seafood that my husband couldnt eat it so i had to eat it all and the consequences wasnt good.... :  will i return? maybe in the future to see if any improvements on food and place.
after going to the movies my husband and i noticed on the marque a notice for the chocolate moose we saw some very nice looking treats but could not figure out the location. a week later we are again walking out of the theater and saw the same marque, so this time we drove around the shopping center until we found it. its tucked between the casino and the theater.once inside i notice the menu wall and a listing for sandwiches and salads. the cupcake listing the favorites and prices for large orders, what i didnt see is the food. i mean they were out of almost all cupcakes and their glass bakery case was nearly empty!for 1130am on sunday, i thought id see lots of things, but was surprised to see it bare. they had a handful of strawberry cupcakes and a few lemon blueberry. but the other cases were empty. the big dessert case at the end had maybe five items but no items were labeled on display, i asked about one, i thnk he called it a greek yogurt cheesecake? i picked one of those and a lemon blueberry cupcake, both very good, flavors strong, cake moist and the chhesecake very dense. there were others in eating lunch, they had ordered salad and a sandwich, i notice they had a list of breads for the sandwich and they made each order fresh. i was disappointed in the lack of choices for cupcakes and such but impressed with my order, will definately be back to try again, hopeful its just new business jitters!
my dining partner and i agreed that being located adjacent to a movie theater, the addition of coffee and icedtea and a selection of herbal teas  would greatly enhance this potentially fun establishments foot traffic. seating is limited to three tables with four chairs and benches indoors. the concept seems to be more geared to take out. we ordered three desserts and one salad and in lieu of an icy glass of iced tea, a mango italian soda. they dont call it an italian soda so tell them you want sparkling water with the flavor in it. theres a lack of attentiveness from the young lady taking the order. she seemed very unsure of herself and im wondering if going back to a simple order pad for taking orders might be helpful. the salad ordered was not available due to no fresh strawberries at the store that morning .  the mandarin salad was no bigger than many side salads weve encountered. very simply a pile of spinach mandarin oranges, and a shaved hard cheese. the salad is served  with a tasty poppyseed dressing.presentation as most foodies know is a big part of our enjoyment of food. very simply if one were to take the item served here from their plastic containers and placing them in a simple dish, the value would be greater. case in point, the chocolate mousse, was served in clear plastic  cups similar to inflight beverages a board most domestic flights here in the united states.  since coffee and teas are not on the menu, perhaps offering and attractively advertising a selection of milk would be a perfect option. some delicious lemonade would be refreshing as well. especially in the desert heat where we live, we need to be able to walk into an establishment and order very simply a beverage. not all diners drink cocacola products which are offered.now regarding the chocolate mousse if this creamy delicious treat were served instead in a selection of mismatched porcelain teacups with the fancy but inexpensive flatware spoon,ordering a chocolate mousse at the chocolate mousse would be elevated to more of an experience. save the plastic dishes and flatware quote for takeout orders only. footed cake stands contain a variety of unique cupcakes that we found difficult to pass up. as tempting as the maple cupcake with a mound of rich looking frosting and glazed bacon was more intriguing, was the butterfinger rum cupcake. it was rich it was delicious and like no weather cupcake ive had before. there are several cupcake joints in henderson but this was the best cupcake ive had from any. the cupcake is represented in this review by the additional third star given. after eating it, i had to remind the young lady about my fizzy mango drink. offering gourmet hot cocoa could be the saving grace for this business. i am imagining custom hot chocolate flavors to pair creatively with the wonderful cupcakes. im looking forward to seeing how this business continues to develop i would like to be able to grant full five stars very soon.
surprisingly spacious bakery spot in the same shopping center as green valley theater probably a good option for a postflick snack, thought they do have some competition in the way of the froyo place in between.service was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. we were offered samples of their namesake chocolate mousse, which was nicely light and tasty. ultimately chose a seasonal fruit tart and a cheesecake cakepop, despite the tempting selection of cupcakes. total was slightly absurd, just shy of 9, which felt a little excessive would expect that on the strip, not in suburbia.the chocolate cheesecake pop was unremarkable very chocolatey but in a dense way that overshadowed the cheesecake tones. the seasonal fruit tart a fabuloussounding mix of pumpkin and sweet potato! was nearly 6 and not nearly as lifechanging as the price led me to expect. pairs well with coffee but didnt have much flavor. overpriced for sure, a bit turned off to give them another try maybe stick with cupcakes and cronuts instead of specials.
language barrierwas told had ranch when ordered salad with meal but then told no when served. served a ginger sauce with salad that tasted more like sesameteriyaki.hibachi chicken was dry, no real flavor.hibachi steak chewy and charcoal shrimp sauce had a thousand island taste.maybe first day jitters!everyone was very nice!3 stars for trying.
so i didnt have high expectations for this restaurant because generally speaking express japanese places arent the best. however i just wasnt cooking tonight and ive been craving some food like this for awhile. i ordered a takeout order for the house and heres how it went. i ordered teriyaki chicken and hibachi steak and it came with veggies and fried rice. my chicken came hibachi instead of teriyaki so i wasnt thrilled about that however it wasnt bad. basically your typical fast food japanese. we also got the phoenix roll, the dynamite roll, and a spicy tuna roll. apparently sushi is buy 2 rolls get 1 free... that earns a star right there!! the sushi was grocery store quality with restaurant prices. that was a little ehh but for a quick fix it did the job. the point is if you go into this place knowing it is a fast food japanese restaurant you wont be disappointed because thats exactly what youre going to get. i give three stars because there were some glitches in my order and the pricing is a bit steep even if you get a free roll. ill probably try it again at some point... they are still new so it could get better!
i prefer to take shorter lunches so i can get out of the office in a timely manner so i am always looking for a great quick lunch option in the general area. hokkaido has some potential but my last visit was not phenomenal. i walked in not far past 11:00am and waited an awkward minute or two for someone in the empty store to come to the front. the woman who did was cheerful and took my order with no problems and the food came out fairly quickly.the disappointment arose when i returned to my desk to find what i think was hibachi sauce everywhere. there was sauce at the bottom of the bag, in the sushi and in the salad. i kept the food level while i was driving so i am not sure where the massive sauce exodus came from but it put a damper on the whole meal. some of the items in the bento were better than others. the worse was the salad i think because the sauce had drenched it and given it a weird vinegar taste. the rice was underwhelming plain fried rice with a couple peas and carrots throughout. the steak was pretty good as was the broccoli and mushroom but i swear i must have had a whole onion in the mix! the spicy tuna was the best of the bunch even with a little hibachi sauce soaked on the bottom. this place is close and the price wasnt terrible so i think i will go back and try an order of hibachi chicken and an order of hibachi vegetables hold the massive amounts of onion! to see if the experience is better when there is no possibility for cross contamination. i also might pick up the buy 2 get 1 free sushi rolls for dinner one night.
i really wanted to like this place. its closeish to work and i love a good good hibachi chicken plate for lunch. it was okay. its in a strip mall, and the food is quick. i had the hibachi chicken with fried rice. the chicken was okay. the sauce was ...different. i like a really light, clean taste with fresh veggies. it was just...off. the veggies were plentiful  unlike what other reviewers have experienced so maybe theyre working on veggie portion size.  there was plenty of rice  very plain but edible. service was nice and attentive. i wish them luck, but dont think they will be around long, and doubt i would visit again. overall, edible and extra star given because veggies were fresh and crisp and service was good. iced tea was good as well.
its an okay place. i liked 1 out of the 4 dishes that our table ordered. very clean place and staff was friendly. expensive for the food though.
i live right across the street from this place and have been wanting to try it out. today, my boyfriend and i finally had the chance to go.  long story short,  food was pretty good but service was lacking so much so we would only go back if it was for takeout.  we were one of two tables in the restaurant and served by stephanie.  the staff,  manager included, were more concerned eating their lunch in a group at the back of the restaurant to be focused on how ours the guest was.  working in the restaurant industry i know what good attentive service looks like and this place needs some work.
a seemingly fresher chinese takeout but lacking in flavors. placing the takeout order by phone was problematic. it seems the person did not know the menu well, so we were off to a bad start anyway. then the food overwhelmed me.
i have eaten at the flos in north scottsdale since i was a kid, so when i saw their sign up in tempe, i got pretty excited. i told my friend we had to come here for happy hour because they have fantastic deals  half off almost all apps and half off all drinks, yes all drinks... awesome! i had the mandarin oriental and my friend had the tytini. her drink was... odd. it wasnt bad, but it didnt taste like anything i have tried before. my drink was very tasty, sweet, but not overly so, and easy to drink. for 4.50, you cant beat it. we also decided to get 3 apps, which have been very delicious at the other location including the pork potstickers, the spicylimey lao lettuce wraps, and the spring rolls. the lao lettuce wraps were as tasty as i remembered... i like how the chicken has a lot of flavor from the chilies, lime, and spices and its especially good with some potsticker sauce on top. the other two apps were horrible failures. the potstickers up north are typically fried, these were steamed, which isnt a problem except they tasted... off. like something about them was bad. they were inedible and we left them behind which is kind of a big deal if you know me because a. potstickersdumplings are one of my favorite foods and b. i never leave food behind, either its eaten or boxed. the spring rolls were greasy and flavorless. i hope the lack of deliciousness was due to the restaurant just opening. regardless, i would return for happy hour drinks if nothing else.
the  food was reasonably priced and they are very accommodating to vegitarian but the four dishes we ordered were a bit bland. the atmosphere is awesome and we are planning to try it again to seen if they had an off night
food was priced right.  it was real loud inside and hard to hear from across the table. waiter was nice and helpful. my only other comment would be that they wait by your table to take your dish whether you were done eating or not. that irritated me tremendously.
i used to eat at the one in nosco before having gluten issues. and having seen on the menu several gluten free items, was happy to give the tempe location a try on a recent visit. i ordered the lemon chicken entree. i had water to drink as they didnt serve alcohol and i am not a huge tea or soda drinker. my boyfriend got the wonton appetizers, he enjoyed them. i refrained the gluten thing. the chicken dish was good but a bit bland, so i asked the server if they had gluten free soy sauce. he went in back and came back several minutes later with some soy sauce in a regular soy sauce container, and said oh i just put it in there. my instinct told me not to try it but my tastebuds won out. within an hour, i was regretting my decision. i was bloated and all the rest of the fun stuff that comes with being glutened. the next day i contacted the restaurant to give the manager on duty the scoop because i felt that he could use the opportunity to better educate the staff on food restrictions that people face. if a restaurant goes out of their way to state on their menu that certain dishes are gluten free, they need to take that seriously  because people with dietary restrictions have no choice but to take it seriously. being glutened is no fun. it very well may have been a simple honest mistake or miscommunication between staff so i wont hold it against them.anyway, i declined devons very kind offer for a free meal upon a return because that was not the point of my call. devon took my critique in stride, was very professional and stated he would definitely talk to the staff. i will definitely give them a second chance since the manager was so understanding.
its always fun to see new restaurants come up in the area  an asian fusion restaurant is definitely right up my alley. we had some evening plans so we just got a couple of dishes to go from flos.the first thing we noticed when we walked in was that the interior is very modern  sleeklooking. theres quite a bit of sitdown seating as well as a few seats at the bar.after a look over the menu, i wanted to try something different but ended up ordering the kung pao chicken with white rice and my date got the singapore bbq pork noodles.the kung pao chicken was fine but i found myself wishing there was a little bit more flavor  spice. also, the veggies that were tossed in with the chicken were different than what you usually find in this dish. it all tasted just okay. the singapore bbq pork noodles were definitely different and interesting. i didnt get too many bites but i thought the ones i did seemed mostly bland. typically noodle dishes arent served with rice but this one was.i thought that the price was not justified. the dishes were both much more expensive than i was expecting in the first place, and then after eating what was served, i didnt find it was worth it. my date did not eat any of the rice so i think it wouldve been better to have an option of not getting rice and paying a little bit less for that entree. overall, i dont feel like i have much of a reason to return.
i was very upset this time around and its not the first time either.  we have had multiple problems since this location opened but we keep trying it because of the food and not the customer service.  when you make a reservation for 9 people 7 adults and 2 children you dont expect to be sat at 2 small tables.  then to find out the manager told them to put it that way was unexceptable. after asking the hostess if we can have another two person table put on he told her no.  the restaurant only had two other tables sat down when we arrived.  after going to the scottsdale location and having amazing service there i expected this location to carry on the same since it has her name.  since it opened i would rather travel to scottsdale and use my gas on better customer service.
food is alright. ambiance is boring. service is always great though! good happy hour menu. i do like that they have a bar area with a couple of tvs. i just wish they had better food options like sushi and a better ambiance.
i came here for lunch one day since its down the street from my work. i ordered the chicken katsu. instead of white rice it actually comes with friend rice which i thought was a good twist. the katsu was good. remember this isnt onos or ll so youre not going to get the best katsu ever. but it was good. for drinks i got the mandarin oriental. omg! for 9 a drink, you definitely get your moneys worth. i actually thought it was a bit too strong. each sip was like taking a shot each time. i thought their dishes were a bit pricey. were talking around 12 a plate. it would be nice if they had lunch specials. they have a very big menu so theres definitely a lot of items to try.
i really like flos. i always try to hit the one in north scottsdale when im in the area so i was ecstatic that they opened a location in tempe. the whole family went tonight. the restaurant is spacious and beautifully appointed and the food was very good, as always. but the service was appalling.my husband and i took separate cars so i arrived before him with two of our children. when we walked in, we were told they didnt have a table. just like that, we dont have a table right now. no offer to put me on the waiting list, nothing. i had to prompt the guy as to what happened next. he said to take a seat, they were cleaning a table. then, a girl followed up and told me it would be 10 minutes because they were clearing a table. we got seated in fairly short order though, so that was ok. our server took awhile to come over. now, understandably, my husband and other daughter werent there yet, so i didnt get too fussed. he took our drink orders and said hed stop back to get our order when our party arrived. my husband and daughter got there and sat down.the waiter walked by us about 5 times and didnt even acknowledge that he saw the rest of our party. he then came over, plunked my drink on the table and walked away again, without asking my husband and daughter if they wanted a drink. then he proceeded to walk past us about 5 more times.he finally came over to take our order. he didnt listen to my husband and put in the wrong order.our food came out very quickly but we had to send my husbands back. so, the short version is, food was good, service was bad. im sure ill be back but this was disappointing.
i think that lush is a generational thing, because my daughter and her friends go nuts for this place and their products. i myself find it completely overwhelming, from the overwhelmingly scented products, to the overwhelmingly helpful staff, to the overwhelmingly stuffed store, to their shouty bold black and white typography and signage. i generally find it overwhelming, full stop. on paper, its awesome, and i do enjoy the scent of one of their products, by itself and far away from the store...but would never buy it myself because all of their products are also quite pricey. so there you go, take a deep breath and venture in and see what you think.
since lush opened in hildale mall i have been there twice. both times the staff were very friendly and helpful. the prices are little high and so i wont be shopping there often. that being said, i love their products! the bath bombs are wonderful and worth the trip. i wish the shop was a bit bigger. it feels really tight in there is they are even a little busy.
my fiance and i went for the weekend lunch buffet because we love our indian cuisine.it was relatively empty when we went in, only another gentleman dining when we arrived.  the ambiance is a little dark for my liking, but the restaurant itself is pretty.  what concerns me a little bit about standing buffets is that if there are no people to eat it, it just sits there all day.the buffet selection is wonderful  it has a lot of dishes that you dont find in other indian buffets, such as soups and fried fish.  i enjoyed everything that i ate.  the food is much better than what i had when this place was karaikudi palace.  their saag paneer is to die for  i ate plate after plateful, and i also enjoyed the tenderness of their goat curry, and i dont even like the gaminess of goat so much.  the aloo gobi was fantastic, spiced perfectly with a surprising addition of okra  i love okra.  the naan was soft and fluffy, though i wish they had a garlic naan option.the chicken curry had a lot of bones in there, to my dismay, as picking them out between bites was not particularly enjoyable.their desserts are also delicious; the gulab jamun was warm and sweet, and the halwa was flavorful.  the only thing i missed was a traditional rice pudding.i have to say that i love the level of spice in these dishes.  i do prefer my food on the hot side, and i could stand for more spiciness, but i do think that what mint has is perfect for most people.our waiter was friendly and helpful  he asked us if we tried certain dishes and how we enjoyed the food.  i think i swallowed a gulp of spice at one point in one of the soups and started coughing, at which point, he immediately came over to fill my glass, which i thought was kind of him.some of the plates were chipped, and while this doesnt really affect my dining experience, i want to make note of it because with the decor so pretty, the chipped plates really dont belong in the dining room.another thing i noticed were the owners family and friends eating from the buffet as well, probably because business was so slow.  this doesnt bother me, and i dont have a strong opinion on this, though i can imagine some diners finding this unprofessional?the weekend lunch buffet is 15 per person, which i think is a little high for what it was.  still, i understand since were in scottsdale, and everything is a bit more expensive here than in surrounding areas, such as tempe or mesa.  i will very likely return for a quick indian buffet fix, though i do think that there are better values for your dollar elsewhere.
expensive!  well, compared to this place before it was sold and renamed.  pricey, yet you have to use plastic cups and ramekins on the buffet for sambar, rasam, chutney, etc.  plastic cup for desserts.  and paper napkins.  wonder why they didnt go with plastic utensils too?  buffet now has more meat choices, if my memory is correct.  vegetarians who liked the old place may not be fond of this.  there isnt the same or similar range of southern indian dosas and utthapam either.  some atypical items on the buffet, and you can get yellow or red curry entrees on the dinner menu.  aiming for an asian fusion theme? not sure.not a good value here, in my opinion.
went here today for dinner. the lassi tasted very bad... rest of the food was all right.
my 2nd bad experience. the spicy chicken biryani had jalepenos in them.authentic indian?? mmmm i dont think so : it did manage to ruin the taste.
hot and new place said yelp, i saw it and boom i had to go. so yeah... didnt expect it to be a whole in the wall place to be honest.the service here took awhile, for our beverages, order and the food. i had the vegetarian egg benedict, it was mediocre. my eggs were overly cooked the yolk didnt break. booo. the hash brown was really soggy in the inside. over all.  i wasnt too fond of this plac, nor the food..
met some friends here last night for a few beers. to get the bar tenders attention was nearly impossible. they seemed more concerned about getting every glass into the dishwasher then serving beer and making money. they failed to ask when they took our empties away if we wanted another one, and we had to wait 1015mins before we were able to get their attention again, even while seated standing at the bar! they could have easily gotten 2 more drinks out of each of us 4 total in group if they were a bit more aware of their surroundings.
great food and drink selectionwent for brunch on a saturday. ordered the hash which was great. but the service was absolutely terrible. it took us 2 hours for 4 of us to get through the restaurant. note the restaurant was half empty as well. the food came out minutes apart from one another and the waitress charged wrong amountsmixed up tabs. so overall the food was great but it was ruined by the service.
nice atmosphere, excellent selection of local craft beer. we were a party of two, and our waitress simply couldnt be bothered. she also mixed up our beers. considering a single beer each was our entire order, thats a bit disappointing. i realize that we didnt represent tremendous tip potential, but really...
checked out this place during wooden robots soft opening for a quick lunch before a long day of libations whatever, i had a friday off, dont judge.their beer list is awesome! definitely some things that i hadnt had, or heard of before. i wont review those here, because thats what untappd is for. the pros of this place: the food is really high quality and unique pub fare. the beer list is pretty awesome, the star of this massive tap wall is local brews, which is great to see. the cons: as tom petty said, the waiting is the hardest part.the first two beers we ordered took about 57 minutes to come out. it didnt seem like the floor staff as opposed to behindthebar was allowed to go and pull the tap handles. come on : we started out ordering a small side order of their pepper jack mac n cheese, because we were waiting for a few more friends to join. this order of a small dish took about 18 minutes to come out. it was great mac n cheese, but not 18 minutes great.our main dishes were probably the most timely out of all things we ordered, coming out at about 1520 minutes. that was acceptable. the rest wasnt.we visited during a very very slow lunch hour, and i dont understand what took so long with a majority of our waiting. i hope this place picks up; ill definitely be back, and i dont want to drop the rating. i want this place to get the 45 stars that it has the potential to get!
oh, i had mixed emotions walking into what used to be dharma lounge to check out the brass tap.  did i need to show my id to the bouncer and pay a cover charge?  they left the stand at the front to use it for the host stand which made it feel even more like i had to do that.  anyway, this place is part of a chain based out of tampa which i did not realize before perusing the site.  however, i had to give them a shot because of the wide selection of beer.  they also have liquor, mixed drinks, and some wine.  i had an ass clown pumpkin ipa which was not good at all, but not the brass taps fault.  they also had half off of shareables appetizers until 7 so i i ordered a beef quesadilla.  it was a decent size but it was typical.  they have different specials every day so you may want to check their site or social media to see what they have.  the bartender was pretty nice too and we conversed a little bit about the old dharma lounge.  i would return here.  it is not a huge place, but it does have a patio and would be a good place to go after work because they have something for everyone.  it basically reminds me of a smaller duckworths but with much more of a corporate feel to it.
disappointing addition to the neighborhood. firstly, the food is bad. now i love bar food, but everything here tastes premade andor frozen. i was excited to see mac and cheese as a side, but then i found out it was plain ol kraft. bummer. this place is a chain, so that probably explains the food. lots of taps, so lots of variety. but thats pretty hard to mess up. they have your charlotte staples noda, triple c, but im not sure how often they switch them out for even more variety. on the upside, the couple times ive been the service has been great! waitresses were above and beyond nice, quick and helpful. give the place a shot, but if youre looking for something unique and authentic, this isnt it.
another solid addition to southend.  i was here on a really slow monday and had a few beers during lunch.  the selection was pretty large but might could use a bit more diversity and maybe some specialty taps.  could very well be that i caught them during a time they just simply didnt have any.the interior is cozy and the bar is nice and long, inviting you to come sit right as you step into the dining area.  the parking is street side only i believe, but i do recall a parking lot down the street that you can likely utilize if needed.
let me start this review by saying i know this is a bar and people come here to drink and have a good time, but there are still limits.we arrived sat 926 around 6pm to celebrate my sisters birthday. we tried to sit out on the patio but there was a group of 12 or so behind us talking and cursing loudly and screaming at the top of their lungs at the tv to the point we could not even carry on a conversation with each other so we moved inside. most people once they get some alcohol in them just dont know how to act in public and that theyre other patrons around them that may not care for that type of behavior or language.inside was a little better but the noise level really didnt come down till around 7pm when the college football games came to an end.the appetizer: warm soft salted pretzel pieces with warm beer cheese. very goodthe beer: they advertise over 300 beers and we tried quite a few that night, but by the same token, they were out of over half a dozen or more we wanted to try.food: typical pub grub that was good. i got their version of fish and chips and my sister let me try her ribeye sandwich on ciabatta bread. both were very good.service: i dont understand the bad reviews for service. even thought it was busy, our server, molly was on top of her game, answering our questions about the beers and making recommendations. she took our food order and brought the meals promptly. she kept the beers coming and quickly cleared away empty glasses and plates and checked on us often.over all we had a good time and i would return but on a week night never again on a weekend. unless you like it uber loud, including a lot of profanity, i would suggest not going on saturdays during college football games. i suspect sunday during nfl football would be about the same.
at first glance, the brass tap was a great place. great ambience, a lot of people but not too crowded to the point where we couldnt sit, not too loud for a friday night, and had a great selection of beer. we ordered drinks after about 10 minutes. i ordered a wine and my boyfriend ordered a beer after a few very grumpy bartenders pretended to care about his questions concerning the beer menu. they did give him samples of a few beers which was nice, but not happily. he finally found the beer he wanted and it definitely was gooda raspberry wheat beer cant remember the name. after about 1520 minutes we finished our drinks and had to wait another 15 minutes for anyone to ask if we wanted another or if we wanted to cash out. we kept trying to get our bartenders attention but they seemed to blow right past us. we finally did get someones attention and paid, still feeling that we were a burden on the bartender. we did not eat here but i would be willing to go back and try the food and service again. the menu was pretty big and offered a variety for low prices considering its south end and things tend to be pricier.
first time at the brass tap. its a pretty big bar and the staff is friendly. i love how they have a variety a drinks other than beer for us non beer drinkers. i had the brass mule. i love moscow mules and this one was decent. i will be back to try the other cocktails.
this place looks torn down! the menu cards were sticked to the island and you have to order them. the menu on the lcd screens wasnt there. not sure why they turned them off.i ordered 6 piece chicken nuggets, a glass for a soft drink and a chicken tender sandwich. it costed me 17 freaking dollars. they were guzzling money at this place. i would get that whole order under 10 in united states, considering the conversion rate, the cost should able atleast below 15. anyways, i enjoyed my ice tea and the chicken nuggets. not sure why i didnt like the chicken sandwich. it tasted weird. the person who was taking order was french and doesnt understand english. so, you have to show him the number on the paper to place the order. it was funny though!
we ordered a california roll, kiss of fire, ikura, inari. the sushi was fresh, very good taste. service was ok. i mean the one woman waiting on tables was all alone. but she was moving quickly. for what ive mentioned so far they deserve 5 stars. however, the ventilation is horrible. i now wreak of old thick oil. my kids needed to be taken outside twice due to the heavy oil smell. it felt like we were covered in grease, and breathing grease. that was horrible!! thick heavy greasy air!! i need a shower and fresh air stat!!!!
so this place, overall, was pretty decent but i just found too many negatives and didnt leave with any omg i need to get that roll again  feelings. pros:friendly service, clean place, cheap price. for all you can eat for 3 adults, 1 spam masubi, 1 spam masubifries, 3 drinks totaled 80.cons:couldnt share my all you can eat with my 2 years old. waiter didnt have an answer to half of our questions.   what drinks do you have for kids?   baked muscles apart of your all you can eat?   didnt know what tai was.fish slices were thin and small.half rolls were limited.i would go there again if i was in the area, but nothing there says oh shit i gotta go back and get me some of dat!
this place is okay. food is decent. service was very slow. not sure if thats due to being short handed or what. i think theyre rating is cushioned a little because they offer some free beer or sake for a good review.
sushi was pretty good  our sever was on the ball considering she was the only one working. my food took very long, i waited 25 minutes for my first roll. there were only 2 other tables, 3 sushi chefs, and i was sitting right at the bar. every roll after that just took a long time. was here 2 hours for the 3 rolls i ordered and the 34 rolls my husband ordered. not very memorable.
the service is slow and impersonal. we were the only table there! the sushi is actually decent not the best but not the worst. the prices for rolls seem lower than other restaurants. i would return for the convenience and price and bare with the service.
sorry, yelp, but you are super wrong on this one.  i am pretty certain that the yelp score is inflated because they are offering people a free drink for a well written review.service was below average, nigiri was almost all rice, rolls were lacking in fish.  some items like the uni and something special roll were good and worth going back for, but the things that i love like baked mussels and screaming orgasm salad were weak.  probably wont go back and will not recommend.
big menu. lots of rolls to choose from for ayce. i was a little taken back that they wanted to charge 13 for my 3 year old. so, we ordered him a la carte instead. service was slow. they need more help. it was a busy saturday night and our server was overwhelmed. nothing special to report. everything was tasty. id go back if i was hungry for sushi and in the area.
the family and i stopped by for lunch on a sunday, not busy at all, got seated right away. we were alone in the restaurant for about 15mins. had our first order in within 10mins of being there but took another 10mins for the first order to show up, btw any child will have to order from menu my 3yr old had to wait about 2025mins to get a spam musubi and some fries. the dragon ball and screaming orgasm are pretty much the only things here i tried that was different from other sushi places we have eaten at and it was pretty good. all in all the sushi was good but not good enough to make this one of the regular spots.overall:3.55
i was craving for sushi, and didnt really want to drive to the other side of town for sakana. i didnt have to wait for seating. i had the ayce. ordered poke, saba, salmon, albacore, saba and uni sushi. this place is quite a disappointment. the proteins were thinly sliced, and so it is the typical huge chunk of rice to little protein ratio. i gotta say, their uni was fresh though. service was really slow, considering that there are only 3 parties in the restaurant.i may or may not be back, but i dont really recommend this place.
they may have changed the sign out front, but its still tokyoto sushi same staff and chefs, same menu. instead of ayce, i usually opt for a la carte or lunch specials the lettuce wrap app is as close to a riceless roll as youll get here, but they do allow you to order handrolls sans rice, for an additional 1 each.lunch specials are on a separate menu. even going during lunch, this menu is not provided upon seating. its also not provided when you ask for it. i had to pull up their website menu on my phone before they brought over the lunch sushi combos list so i could order kind of irritating. other than that and forgetting my beverage for the duration of my visit, service was polite.the lunch combo 3 is my favorite: miso soup and two gyoza, plus your choice of two special rolls from a limited list. the given options are just okay, most of them are shrimp tempura rolls. the namesake omy roll and the aladdin roll are both fairly plain, and the rice fell apart where sauces were used.
well, the good side is it has the latest movies and isnt very crowded.  the staff was also friendly. the down side is for a person who hasnt smelled much of anything for years due to allergies, i smelled the musty theater  which means it had to be bad. also the seats dont have tilt up arm rests and not much cush for the tush so they arent as comfy as more modern theater seating. overall, average  three stars
old style theater, arms do not lift up, the chairs are not recliners, they even feel smaller, but the screen is big and surround sound is good. even the price, 4.00 before four pm,  mw is a bargin!they always have first rate movies and times are good, the popcorn is fresh and the staff are friendly, good experience!
so we visited around 8pm purchased our tickets as soon as we walked in we noticed how dirty it was really gross..... we bought a large  popcorn and drinks but the popcorn bag seemed much smaller than other places no biggy until we started eating the popcorn and noticed that it was stale and a half of it was over done pretty much burned if it wasnt for the new chairs they would totally get a 1 star plus the employees were not friendly or helpful at all
the ticket prices are fair.  especially for 3d and assigned semiluxury seating.  the price they charge for food isnt.  2 sodas and a large popcorn for 20?  and thats a combo price? no thanks.the seat next to me was broken and did not have power to retract the recliner.  good thing the theater was not full, we just switched seats.the one thing i really dont like is that it isnt stadium seating.  no matter where you sit you have to look up at the screen.id go here again, but would not buy their food.
so.. i finally checked this place out after the remodel that includes recliners ...for its price point the place is awesome . i am a self pro claimed movie snob so i am going with three stars because its just simply ok for my standards and let me go ahead and review and explain why.                                                                                                                                                                                            i arrived a bit late for the film i was seeing so my friend entered before i got there with the digital ticket that you can either have texted msged or emailed which is nice, the staff was friendly but initially was refusing to let me in since the person i came with entered first. they should have printed out both tickets and informed my movie buddy that he would need to bring my ticket or leave it with the employee but they didnt. as you can imagine standing around trying to get in when i personally had purchased the tickets and all wasnt fun! when i did get the chance to enter the building i preceded to the concessions. i signed up for a stubs reward card but its digital and got that all set up and got my large coke zero. they have the awesome flavor machines to make your own drink.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        when i finally got to the theatre which they didnt bother to tell me which number i was in...it was pitch black and really really really hard to see the rows to figure out where my seat was. i felt terrible having to flash my phone and not even be able to tell my row. thankfully i was able to make out where my friend was in the dark and found my seat... i attended a friday early afternoon matinee and let me warn you  this place gets packed. dont get me wrong.. who wouldnt want to pay super low ticket prices to lounge in a recliner? so i get why its busy but for myself personally i will stick with my go to theatres unless i am just seeing a film with my kids or meeting up with friends and need a neutral location . if i had a choice between seeing a film in regular type seats or going to rainbow for recliners. rainbow amc would win..  p.s i recommend going ahead and ponying up the cash for a stubs reward card. that allows you to reserve your seats online without the extra convenience fee, plus you get auto upsizes on your popcorn or soda and best yet for every 100 you spend you earn a reward.. which who are we kidding.. it only takes one or two family filled movie nights to spend 100 lol
got here at 9:30am for at 10am movie. the very short manager here decided to open the doors at 9:45. im now standing in line waiting for snacks and well be late for the movie. remember this is the first movie of the day for the theather, but the staff can t get the place open on time. price for tickets here is good, seats are nice. staff is poor and snacks are high. i understand that theathers are places were highschool kids get there first job. but the manager should be smarter then a twenty year old, but she is not. update, got into the theater at 10:10. after arriving at 9:30, first movie of the day and you can t open on time
the few people we talked to in person were nice. but the lady on the phone was rude. when someone calls saying your site isnt taking gift cards or debit cards, dont get an attitude saying you dont care and nothing you can do.
it makes me sad to only give this place three stars, as its a new local business. its very nicely decorated inside and with comfortable and abundant seating. there was only one other person there when i arrived and during my visit around lunch hours. pizza menu is very persianinfluenced, and the counter up front has pictures so it is helpful to look at as you decide what to order. my boyfriend had the individual sized buffalo chicken pizza and me the margherita pizza tomatoes, cheese, basil and an order of fries. with a bogo coupon, our total came to be about 11. taste was quite mediocre, nothing too special although the dough was chewy and good. order of fries was pretty small for 3. probably not worth the full price. they do have 15 off for showing your unlv student id.
this restaurant has had a lot of hype. ill dissent somewhat. on a recent visit i found the food very good but the service  i was seated at the bar  somewhat offhand. i had to ask for bread, and the response was a half slice of decent bread plunked on a small plate. isnt bread a standard feature of good restos? also the glass of champagne i had was almost lukewarm. even though it was fairly early, the noise level was already quite high. not recommended for a quiet or intimate dinner.
3.5 stars. i need to try this location again, but not for sunday brunch. i get the montreals weekend brunch culture is popular and therefore restaurants become very hectic but there was no organization practiced here at all. i thought we were lucky to be seated right away and on the patio! score! except we were surrounded by tables of really needy types of tourists. so my table of two slipped the minds of the waiters i suppose and i waited at least 30 minutes for some coffee. and then waited for food. and then waited and waited for the bill. and waited while the waiter said he would get the machine but cleared tables instead. and i wouldnt be bothered by any of this if i didnt know right across the street in my view is the always busy but organized lavenue where even though they are super busy they take the time to give you juice and always refill your coffee. im not mad about the experience at cacao 70 because everyone working there seemed new and like they had never worked a sunday brunch rush before. and maybe they hadnt. but my lesson was learned. dont go for breakfast. all that aside, the food was pretty good. i love chocolate so that was perfect, the crepe was okay. i wouldnt suggest ordering a side of bacon. it was that kind that is as thin as paper. not very good. my boyfriend was satisfied by his omelette. i will try again for dessert someday in hopes of a better experience.
i would like to start by saying that this was the first restaurant we dined at upon arriving in montreal last tuesday afternoon.  we were strolling down mont royal looking for a tasty place to eat and this fine establishment caught our eye.we walked in and didnt have to wait long to be seated.  my partner, mother, father, and i shared a booth near the open window.  i must note that it was extremely warm.  the weather outside was pretty unbearable, however being inside did not help much as i dont think they had any ac on at all!  we received three menus.  one had typical breakfast items and sandwiches, one had sweet entrees, and the other had chocolate varieties.  it was a bit overwhelming but there were many pictures of very delicious looking foods  yum!the nice and pretty waitress came to take our order.  my partner attempted to order a beer, which was on the menu, however the nice and pretty waitress informed us that they dont yet have a liquor license because theyre new and are, therefore, unable to serve him the beer.  this is unacceptable.  if there is beer on the menu, there best be beer in our bellies.i ordered the vegetarian omelette, which came with a starter of fruits and warm melted chocolate for dipping.  it was strange that the bananas came unpeeled and the strawberries were oddly shaped.  nonetheless, the warm melted chocolate was delicious!we waited about 20 minutes for our main dishes to arrive.  my partner and mother ordered the vegetarian sandwich.  my mother is a big fan of bacon, so she decided to add bacon to hers for an extra fee.  however, when her sandwich arrived she described the bacon as the same kind they use at tim hortons, the kind you microwave... very disappointing for an esteemed restaurant. soggy bacon is not acceptable.at this time i would like to say that there was the cutest little child ever sitting at a table by ours. he had a nice watch on and a great haircut.  best wishes growing up, kid!onto a different note, we noticed something a little fishy in the bathrooms.  there were signs in the stalls that requested we put our used toilet paper in the garbage bins which were open, without lids rather than the toilets.  i wonder how sanitary this is... i get it if your toilets arent working so well but at least get a garbage bin with a lid on it to avoid gross things getting in the air.  please either get a plumber or rethink your waste management outlook.  i was appalled. though our savoury meals were satisfactory, in hindsight i think it would be best to come to cacao 70 with a sweet tooth, if you know what i mean. our teeth wanted salty brunch, but cacao 70 is more suited for someone with teeth interested in something a little more chocolatey, or cacaoy, as they might put it themselves. overall im still not sure how to pronounce cacao correctly, but this montroyal chocolate emporium had me thinking bring on the sweets!. a nice start to the vacation in montreal. i plan to return for a chocolate waffle, or maybe even a piece of chocolate on its own, or fondue or hot chocolate. as soon as they get their plumbing fixed. maybe its fixed already, who knows?
i want to really like this place because i enjoy new dining options in dtlv. however, this place just wasnt doing it for me. i believe theyre going through an identity crisis? though, im not quite sure. i would like to say the hostesses greeting guests were very friendly, welcoming, and so was the bartender who served us, however, friendly only gets you so far. first we took a look beer and wine list and the beer list is quite extensive and we had many questions about the different beers, unfortunately the bartender didnt know very much or even know how to pronounce them. they also server frozen drinks, which i thought was a bit odd considering its all inside and it definitely isnt a pool. next, many manager or owner type guys were looming around maybe they owned the place, maybe not. now, i understand it was the first night, but none of these guys really seemed to be professionals, we werent greeted by them, or asked how we enjoyed ourselves or anything. the reason i knew they had something to do with the place is because they seemed to have set up shop in the corner or the bar doing their work, eating, drinking it was a big glup type drink, classy all in view of the guests. if you are the manager or owner you should be greeting ever guest walking in your door on opening night, not just your buddies, and ask how everyone is doing. the food was good, and this it was im actually rating my review on. we had the roasted cauliflower which is one of my favorites anywhere. this was super oily though, so for me i probably wouldnt order it again. the summer squash flatbread was great and my boyfriend really enjoyed the oxtail empanadas. none of the dishes were to die for, but they were good.if this place is going to be more like a sports bar than a tapas experience then i probably wont be running back, especially if the ownersmanagers carried themselves the way they did.
be prepared to wait and wait some more! if you sit down to eat, except to wait a long time to get your drinks at the bar and twice the time to get your food. the server did tell us that the restaurant takes their time, its not about rushing people in and out, but two hours for a hamburger and a french dip is way too long. the food and drinks were delicious so no complaint there. the servers were polite and sociable.  just be prepared to wait, thats the only downfall :
so i am not sure what people are talking about when they are saying good value.  does this mean that the portions are big, or the price vs. what you get is comparable to other dtlv?  because that is not the case.  first of all let me say that i am not the type of guy to walk into a restaurant and base it off of how much food you can serve up onto a plate...this is ridiculous and the reason we have major health and obesity issues in our fair country...well along with a lot of other reasons but it is a strong contribution.  therapy has come into the dtlv area and with the first restaurant under the owners belts it falls short on a few things.  lets focus on what they are doing right first, because im not here to bash, im here to help the readers make good decisions on their dinning experience and go to a place that is true to what you read.  the space is amazing.  exposed beams that were stained walnut and were a discovery while demoing the room for the new restaurant, a brick south wall that ties in the exposed ducting and ventilation to make the place seem huge and open.  the place breathes and the 130 seats fit nicely within the walls.  nothing is cramped, it was an impressive renovation and detail was attended to...nice job gents!  chef daniel ontiveros who hails from comme ca as the executive chef in the cosmopolitan has taken over the open window kitchen and has serious chops.  his menu has been sliced and diced though due to the size of the kitchen...which is the only thing in the restaurant that is small.  9 menu items have already seen the chopping block due to the sheer need for more space and prep.  on the dl he had more to his menu in the beginning and that was put by the wayside for a more american tapas style.  what the hell does that even mean...american tapas?  they are more of a shared small plate style and do have a few larger entrees that look like they might fit into a more traditional meal style establishment.  the bartender was super friendly and tried to guide me in the best way she could through the menu, although she really didnt have a good knowledge base of the beers they had and had no idea where to find them in the cooler....i actually had to point them out to her.  not a big deal, but if you are new, and you have put all this money into a new venture, lets start paying attention to detail folks and train your staff.the food...well it was good, nothing to write home about but tasty enough. but do you go to a restaurant to have just ok food?  i mean i like to walk away and be like, i cant wait to go back and try more dishes!  which is how i felt about carsons kitchen and the newly changed menu at rcp, all in the same area.  the dishes were also a bit overpriced for downtown. the asparagus, country ham and shaved parmesan with a poached egg is what really tweaked my britches though.  i never send stuff back, mostly because i have worked in the food industry and there are some shady buggers in the back that get peeved and do not so nice stuff to the food...maybe not in these types of places but enough to make me worry just a bit..ever seen waiter...yea.  the soft poached egg came out, the first time, hard and not a bit of yolk to spill out over all the yummy goodness that i was expecting after the the gm prepared me for what was to come.  so, i sent it back and received a new one.....dammmmiiittttt!!!  it was the same bloody thing.  ugh!!!! i asked the gm if they suveed their eggs or cooked them to order and he told me that they did them to order, and then proceeded to tell me that this was the way it should be even after telling me that it should run over the asparagus and soak into the dish like a pretty little yolk blanket my words not his.  so i ate it and...well meh.  the oxtail empanadas were pretty good though, the oxtail meat is braised apparently for 12 hours and the empanada dough is home made by the pastry chef in back who also does their bread in house. chef daniel came out to apologize for the mistakes and that made most of it all better for me, i love when a chef has the newtons to come out and take the beating for what is being created in the back..good for you chef.  so, i will probably go back just to try it out and see if it all was just growing pains and i will bring a bigger wallet and maybe a rich friend to pay for it all.  the last thing is, owners, please dont lurk, i know this is your first venture but creepy is not a good way to keep people coming back.  thanks chef daniel i know you have the chops to make this place better, please, please dont let the menu fall into the bar and frozen drink category of freemont street, seriously guys...frozen drinks on your cocktail list...wow.
cute new restaurant downtown. we went for a little tasting for a work event and it was enough of a tease, a good tease to make us want to come back for more. we got a taste of the carrot cake with brown butter ice cream, baked ricotta with fig jam on a walnut cranberry crostini, chicken meatball with cilantro pesto, gulf shrimp ceviche and summer squash flatbread. and upon arrival greeted with a delicious cab. all very tasty!back for lunch the following day for a team lunch. i got the hangar steak tartare which the presentation was cute and liked the pickled toppings. street corn was my favorite!! if you like bacon the popcorn mix is different and a fun appetizer.i do recommend if you are going for lunch or a meal order the burger or french dip because the price you pay for a flatbread is the same and you get more for your money for a full sandwich.  seems a little odd that you pay the same for a giantgood size burger or french dip and a small flatbread. the flatbread wont fill you up unless you have a bunch of other snacks. its more of a pricey appetizer small plate, the middle section of the menu. its good just not a meal if that is what you are expecting, so i think pricing is a little disproportionate.otherwise great new option downtown. i will be back to try the burger and dessert!
cool lounge with some quality food, nice spot for something new on fremont. it was too early in the day to drink, so i popped in for some apps: the social club portion of the menu is tapasstyle but the portion sizes dont really lend themselves to much in the way of sharing.oxtail empanadas: delightful outer shell, great flavor on the actual oxtail, but it was a bit on the dry side. those corner bites where the grease and juices collected were pretty great, though. this was served with a harissalime creme fraiche dipping sauce that had more color than flavor and did not add anything to the flavors of the dish itself. hangar steak tartare: a passable classic version, but not one of the better ones in town. good selection of pickled veggies, four crisp slices of grilled bread, and a reasonable portion, but not something id necessarily get again.even with just the two dishes i tried, the menu shows some promise. ill have to come back with a few friends to try more, particularly the in the gnudi, as my dining partner this visit is unable to eat ricotta. service was friendly and attentive without being pushy, bartender was happy to suggest a few of her favorite dishes.
the room is gorgeous, the food and service were great! the only reason i rate so low is theres nothing i loathe more than walking into an establishment for eating at 1030pm and hearing a dj who 1 has absolutely zero idea what hes doing. 2 is playing music nowhere near conducive to the mood of dining room. 3 continously playing a drop of his dj name dj toxic to let the 6 people who were probably so hungry they overlooked the terrible music selection, inability to properly mix two songs together and masculine inadequateness to keep playing his name drop. im hungry and most women in my life already tell me im hard of hearing, i dont need to be made completely deaf dont get me wrong, the food, service and room were tip top. im just curious if youd hire servers, cooks and bartenders with zero experience much less a clue of what theyre doing, why youd hire a dj of the same skill set.
cured meats and roasted asparagus are a no.oxtail emanadas and gnudi are a yes.
first impression from walking in, very well thought out establishment. inside was very warming, great spirits collection. minus the sangria, which tasted somewhat bitter. the manager kindly removed it from our bill. the server was very sweet, and attentive to our needs. food was 710. i ate their new twist on the blt. the meat was a little fatty. but, i managed to get through it. not sure if ill be returning here. but overall it was a pleasant experience.
went there friday night for dinner before going out. super chill new york loft type of decor until the dj came  played waaaay too loud. i couldnt even hear the person talking sitting right next to me took one star away for that. we ordered a lot of the share plates  apps. some great, some good  some we wouldnt order again. great: ox tail empanadas, mushroom flat bread  chefs special but on peach tartgood: mac  cheese  gnudi cheese app not again: chicken meatballs  shrimp ceviche more like a gazpachooverall i would go again, but would recommend management tell the dj to lower to music to tables can have a conversation with each other.
its neat to see what therapy has become, especially considering where it started. what used to be a complete dump of a horrible tourist gift shop is now one of the nicer lounge type restaurants in the area. not only does therapy have a full bar if youre looking to just stop in for a drink, but there are dining areas both downstairs and upstairs. its another great example of the revitalization of downtown.our first visit here was a somewhat short one. we had just finished dinner around the corner, and decided to stop in for a drink. alongside a handful of beers on tap, they have a few signature cocktails and housemade sangrias. for the ridiculously hot days in vegas, they even offer some frozen drinks. i decided to give the smash! a shot after hearing good things about it, but unfortunately wasnt a huge fan. the bourbon was there, but not much of it and completely masked by the blackberry and sweetened lime. on our next visit, we sat down with a party of about 10 and ordered up about as much as we could on the menu. much like the direction many new restaurants are taking, therapy has two sections of the menu called the social club and bites which focus on shareable plates. of the 15 items between the two sections, we ended up ordering 10 of them.a few things that stood out for me were the chicken  red velvet waffle sliders, shrimp ceviche and the hangar steak tartar. the chicken and waffle sliders are actually pretty big and if ordered alone could probably be a dinner for some. i liked the large, juicy piece of chicken and the mild sweetness from the waffle. it also has a spicy remoulade that adds a nice little kick. and while the ceviche was real heavy on the tomato flavor, but mild on the citrus, i still enjoyed it. it was fresh, bright and flavorful. as far as the tartar goes, i think i was one of the few at our table who enjoyed it. i havent had tartar at many restaurants, but i liked the seasoning in addition to the egg and crispy grilled bread. we didnt order a whole lot from the larger plates, but we did have a couple items that are worth mentioning. the charred kale is an excellent salad that was really one of the top items of the night. it had amazing flavor and i loved both the fresh egg and bacon smoked bacon vinaigrette topping it. another surprising favorite was the french dip. this sandwich is not the typical dry bread, low quality meat and oily ju that you find almost everywhere else. the flavors were spot on, the meat was tender and juicy, and the sandwich as a whole just had the right amount of heat from the horseradish. its also served with crispy chips that have a present, but deliciously addicting truffle flavor. to finish out the night, we ordered 3 out of their 4 desserts. the cast iron smores was crazy sweet, and could definitely benefit from a little more bacon to offset that. both the crumbled carrot cake and pure decadence chocolate cake were much better, but still probably not something id order again. i did really enjoy the brown butter ice cream though that was on the carrot cake, and would probably order that alone if it was offered.because we ordered nearly 20 items from the menu and only a few were things id come back for, i dont think id rush back. we also had less than stellar service. for whatever reason, our waiter forgot to put in an order of the cheddar mac  cheese, which was something quite a few of our party was anticipating. she admitted to forgetting it, but after asking her to still put the order in, she either forgot again, or blew it off. this was basically towards the end of our meal too, and we had already asked for it twice before that. shortly after, we watched another table next to us get an order of it, then our table was cleaned off and she started asking about dessert. luckily she remembered to take it off the bill, but it was still frustrating to miss a dish that was asked for multiple times.after 2 visits, im still a bit torn on therapy. theyve definitely got a lot to offer, and its another great addition to the new downtown, but some things just fall a little short to bump this up to 4 stars.
bleh. whatever you do, dont get the pina colada. worst ever. we ordered almost everything off the menu group of 7 and some things were good, most werent. id say skip it.
i dont know if this place just didnt sit well with me or if i had an off night, but i was not having a great time here. my first thought when i walked in was, this place was huge! then i tried to scour my brain to think of what used to be there. we were seated immediately. the inside is very clean. nice, modern touch to it. everything is in top order. a plus.server was very nice. first beer i ordered was not available it was a brown ale. the fort collins rocky mountain ipa was gross. too flowery. the fort collins 1020 pale ale was also gross. not therapys fault, but this is just to set the stage of where my night was going.we ordered the oxtail empanadas and the steak tar tar. the oxtail empanadas are out of this world delicious. oxtail is delicious and there is a generous amount inside that fluffy shell. the creme fraiche was a nice compliment for the empanada. little sprigs of cilantro sit on top of the empanadas, great flavor as well.now the steak tar tar. there was not one thing i liked about this. the steak tar tar comes with grilled bread and some pickled vegetables. i took a bite of the steak tar tar on top of the grilled bread and it was funky. just funky. now ive had steak tar tar before, but not like this. i tried to pick out what i didnt like. i had a bite of the bread and it was legitimately gross. i asked the server what kind of bread and she wasnt quite sure what it was. i had a nibble of the steak tar tar and that was also funky. there must have been a spice in the tar tar, but i couldnt figure it out. even the damn pickles were disgusting. one was fine and then the other...i just got a mouth full of black licorice. i was told it was probably star anise? the pickling agent. it was foul.the good thing was that i was honest with the server that the steak tar tar was not good. i did say that it might just be me though. server was nice enough to remove the steak tar tar off the bill i didnt ask her too, it was very nice. i wasnt super hungry so i didnt get anything else, but was intrigued by street corn. overall, i think this is a good date spot. its clean and new. you can dress up or come in with shorts and a tank. its versatile. plus, the food servings are the best for really 2 people. i may give the place another shot. i will be downtown again and its great to get a bite to eat. just hope my next venture in i have better luck.and some of that street corn.
came here the first or second week of opening and wasnt a fan of the food overall.  tasted bland and i thought the menu was a knock off of carsons which is better imo.  the decor is really nice, fancy even and looks like a good place for date night. they also have tvs at the bar which is scarce on the east.
im a local who visited therapy for the first time this week for lunch after having eaten at manymost of the places downtown. first, service  atmosphere were great. coffee was great some of the best ive had. my dining companion had the salmon, which she said was amazing although for 19, the portion seemed a bit small.  unfortunately, i was not a big fan of the charred kale salad. kale was sauteed, not really charred and ive had charred spinach and kale at other restaurants so i had some expectations about how it would be prepared. it was not cut into manageable pieces and was chewy. very hard to eat thank goodness i was eating with a friend and not on a date. and i think i counted about 45 small beets in the entire salad. would not order again.
went here last night for dinner. we started with the deep fried pigs ear which was absolutely delicious! i had to stop myself from eating the whole thing. for the main course i ordered the bonein pork chop and my companion ordered the shrimp scampi. unfortunately my pork chop was overcooked, which made it hard for me to enjoy it even though they did an amazing job preparing the rest of the dish. the service was kinda spotty, maybe due to the large crowd that evening. we really had to work hard to get her attention when needed. theres a lot of other dishes id like to come back to and try, so id give them another chance to try and change my opinion of the place.
the drinks are amazing and well worth the 10 each costs. the food was way too overpriced for what it was. most of the menu is tapas style, aka tiny portions. the oxtail empanadas were tiny and not that flavorful. the corn on the cob, mac and cheese, and red velvet waffle sliders were good, but nothing to write home about.
awesome place. nice ambiance. just the type of bar vegas needs where you dont have to go to strip to have a good time. food prices are okay. but the food itself is just soso.
stopped in a recommendation from a friend. seated instantly and really liked the atmosphere. georgie was our server and she was a sweetheart. so the positives are that the place is a cool spot and they have great service and it is apparent that their menu is still a work in progress. i had seen their funky popcorn from yelp pictures and wanted to try it, but they axed it off the menu because nobody actually liked it. we decided on the steak tartar and the oxtail empanadas. the steak tartar was just ok. i could not place what spice was off putting about it. the parm and egg on it were just fine but the meat also did not seem very fresh. georgie was nice enough to take the item off of our table and off our bill when we told her the feedback. that is awesome! i did really like the oxtail empanadas. the creme fraiche had a little seasoning to it that i liked.i hope they continue to progress and get a couple more beers on tap. i look forward to going back.
went in for happy hour on sunday. the drinks were good especially the shot of the day. service was good. but the food was okay not all that great. the waffles were falling apart by the first bite. i would go back just for drinks.
traditional american doesnt apply here. dont get me wrong thats a good thing in my book. where do you traditionally get red velvet waffles and fried chicken or oxtail empanadas, french dips and burger ok.  the food is good and atmosphere is pleasant, but i do have a few quibbles to air. cole slaw with chicken and waffles is a nice idea but poorly executed here  either too old or too finely cut to maintain any texture the french dip has some of the finest meat available and im a butcher but the demi not au jus is straight up number 10 can of knorr powder. grilled carrots are uninspiring and over use of arugula garnish plagues many dishes. but with some wise choosing on your part and solid dinning experience with a stellar server in krysten
therapy has a great vibe going for it  the staff are buttoned up in fancy vests, theres 3 large screen tvs at the bar, and the restaurant pulls off an upscale industrial aesthetic. my beau and i decided to stop at therapy before a concert on a sunday night around 8pm. the restaurant on the first floor was empty aside from a few people sitting at the bar. we were immediately seated and our orders were taken promptly, but service after that kind of fell flat.portobello mushroom burger 13: between a choice of this and macaroni and cheese, the burger won! the menu doesnt specify whether this entree comes with a side, so i asked the waitress if the burger came with fries. she said it usually comes with a salad but substituting fries would be no problem. score! nobody wants that rabbit food anyways. :p the burger tastewise was alright  it could have been kicked up a notch or two flavor wise. the fries were warm and had the perfect texture, but likewise were pretty flavorless. we added salt. 35  chimichurri steak 19: my husband said the steak was alright and that it filled him up, despite appearances. this is an a la carte menu item. 35service: the manager brought us our entrees and opened the door for us as we left, so he was awesome. our server was mostly absent, though. it was a struggle trying to get refills and the check. another annoyance was that the table was sticky and left a gross film on my phone cover. 25the real killer here for us was the service. the place was practically empty, so i dont see how the service could be so dismal. maybe eating at the bar is the way to go here?yelp 100 challenge 2015: 262
we got our food to go and it was ok.  they were out of beef patties, which was a little disappointing.  but at least we got our curry shrimp, rice and beans, cabbage, and mac  cheese.  it was good food, but i think caribbean hut has this place beat!  its a hole in the wall spot and you probably should do take out inside of dine in.
i used to go to yoga unlimited, so i decided to give this new yoga studio in the yoga unlimited spot a try. i signed up online for a free introductory class, and chose the restorative yoga class at 5.30 in the afternoon on thursday. when i arrived, checkin went smoothly and quickly, and the young man at the front desk was friendly and knew what he was doing. upon entering the studio, i noticed that they had bought some electronic candles for mood lighting, which was a nice touch. the props  blocks, blankets, and straps  are leftovers from yoga unlimited. here is one point of contention for me: after class, props go right back into the bin they came from, so im not totally convinced they are cleaned or disinfected between classes or even on a regular basis. i may be wrong.the class itself was overall fine. the instructor, who i dont think introduced herself by name or else i wasnt listening, was very zen and i really appreciated her reminders about mindfulness and observing our breath. she  did a great job guiding us through the class. the class itself consisted of only a few poses that were held for extended periods of time  savasana, lying butterfly, childs pose, catcow, and half pigeon pose. this all took about 80 minutes, so it was definitely a relaxing class. one complaint i had about the class was that we were told to use props, and i absolutely abhor using props during my practice. i end up spending half the time fiddling with the prop, adjusting it, and trying to get them just right e.g., i hate the feeling of a lopsided blanket under my back, and lose focus and mindbody awareness. i think props are a distraction. i didnt want to be defiant, though, so i complied and spent half the class messing with them and grumbling to myself. overall, it was an ok class. i dont think i would pay 20 for a dropin class in the future.
we ordered at 7:30pm on a saturday night and our food arrived around 9:10pm. slow delivery, but the restaurant did text me to keep me updated and let me know when the driver left for our delivery which was nice. we ordered the beef soup, which ended up being more of a stew but it was pretty good. quesadilla was cold and bland. ordered a shrimp ceviche that was decent and got a crab ceviche for free not sure if that was an error or gift, but fine by me!. the fruit punch was delicious, definitely get some of that. it has fruit chunks in it and is heavenly. my boyfriend also got a ham sandwich and he seemed happy haha. i guess we forgot to get much actual mexican food to really try this place out!i give three stars for the slow delivery and food that was just ok except the juice  thats pure heaven. not bad but certainly didnt blow me away either. also the minimum order of 30 for delivery was a little frustrating. we will try it again thoughfor sure, especially since we somehow forgot to order much real mexican food!
this place was delicious but delivery took forever. the driver did call to tell me he was going to be ten minutes late but he ended up being an hour late. frustrating. would have been much more tolerable if hed just been honest to begin with. when he finally showed up 2 hours after we placed the order he said hed had to do a delivery downtown and gave us a card for 10 off next time. seriously?  10?  thats why restaurants have a delivery area. why are they delivering to downtown from north vegas?  they need to either hire more drivers or limit their delivery area. such a shame because the food really was tasty.
the cashier taking the  order was rude, did not  great  us at all, neither  thank us at the  end, order to dine out.  while ordering  had to repeat myself in different  occasions.  i spend  like fifty dollars, left  five dollars  tip, ordered  couple of thai  tea drinks, which  the same  lady comes back and throws them at us including  the  straws.  all the cooks and other employees  kept  staring like if we were some  criminals.  made us feel  very  uncomfortable, i was about to  cancel  my order when finally another  ladyemployee  finally  gave  us our order without  acknowledging  us either.  i noticed  three other  customers  coming  in, and the same cashier  acts very nice, polite to this customers.  a complete  quality  of  customer service  to them.  dont  we all deserve  the same  type  of  customer  service?  i  honestly  dont  want  to  mention  races, ethnicities.  as for me  it would  be  the last  time  going  to  that restaurant.  to the  owner  please teach your employees customer  service, and ethics classes.  food  its  good.
on vacation from la this dunkin donuts was close by our hotel. i was excited to finally try dunkin donuts! the donuts were just ok. i have had much better.
nice addition to the far west side. they just opened in june and as other reviewers have suggested, they have a few kinks to work out. its not the typical dim sum where they come around with a cart. they give you a large picture menu and you check the box next to what you want. we were seated quickly but then no one came by to take our order. we had to basically ask someone walking past. she was friendly and helpful but it was a little odd. the dishes come out of the kitchen as they are prepared. dishes came out mostly one at a time as there was quite a wait for our first dumplings. not a good place to go if you are super hungry! on to what we ordered: the siu mai were the highlight. they did not skimp on the shrimp! the fried pork dumpling came highly recommended by our waitress but we found them quite oily. the panfried vegetable and pork buns were very tasty. the short rib with honey sauce had outstanding flavor but were mostly bone rather than meat. we also tried the baked creamy egg yolk bun per the waitress recs. this is something i never would have ordered otherwise and it was delicious! sweet and sugary and definitely did not taste like egg yolks. ill be back to try a few other things. high on my list are the xiao long buns :
friendly service, but very slow. the food that arrived did not look like the food we ordered from their menu.
solid 3 stars.went here for dim sum with a few of my home girls.a few observations:1. restaurant is quite large  plenty of seating.2. they serve dim sum and entrees for lunchdinner.3. where are the aggressive ladies with the cartsno where...thats right  at this establishment you order off menu for dim sum.food was good aok.  tough critic, i know.here was the spread followed by a brief description and review:1. shumai shrimp dumplings: yummy in tummy2. ha gao shrimp  pork dumplings: mmm good3. cha sui bao bbq pork buns: another order please4. xiao long bao soup dumplings on special menu: eh5. sticky rice: sup girl, can i get yo numba?6. taro cakes: eh7. sesame balls: on fleekbig papa
the skinny: custom built 12 inch pizza, unlimited toppings for 7.99 with some flavorful toppings love the grilled zucchini   vegan and gluten free crust available for extra charge3.5 service is good with counter service 3 value: not bad for a custom built pizza joint 3.5.with all the custom built with unlimited toppings popping up here in the valley,  pizza kitchen is a welcome addition. i liked their toppings of house cheese blend, grilled zucchini loved this, arugula, fresh basil, sundried tomatoes and meatballs. the ham, sausage and ricotta didnt quite do it for me though. their red sauce had a nice acidity to it which i enjoyed. fyi  for those that like spice, they do have sriracha flavored meats ie,  chicken and i think sausage?  which do not have at the other custom built places. the whole wheat crust was quite nice   more doughy than the usual thinner cracker crust. loved how the edges are hand pulled at the end to give it a nicer crust. the pizza is baked on a conveyor belt vs. woodfired. the benefit is you get a more consistent crust. but the down side is you miss the smokiness of a woodfired product. i also noticed that they now offer custom build salads for 7.99 now which i think i try next time i drop by.this place does a pretty good custom built pizza and does offer some toppings that others do not have. the crust is different enough to distinguish it from its competitors. staff is friendly and helpful. overall, a pretty good pizza for the price. 3.5 star review.
pretty cool made to order pizza. everything is fresh and prepared in front of you. not an original idea, but rare to find in a pizza joint. decor is too bland; obviously they wanted you to come in and out quickly, hence the short time to get your pizza ready, which is not a bad thing if you are in a hurry. but it feels more like a sandwich place than a pizza place. staff i dealt with were very friendly.not the place to expect the best quality pizza, but for the price and speed of preparation, you have to let go of some other qualities i guess. still, it is a very decent tasting pizza, and thin enough so you dont feel like you are eating too much but this is also how they save in costs. atmosphere is not that great; you feel more like in a hospital cafeteria than in an italian eatery. overall, i would go again and recommend it but not for best taste pizza in town, more for the speed and price....
i wanted to really love this place since i am seriously missing custom built, but i think it was just ok.to start with, the employee that helped us young man, im terrible with names, sorry! was very nice and helpful. he explained everything as we went since it was our first time there, and even though i am not new to that type of place, i didnt want to interrupt his schpeal, so i just let him :the place was clean and much larger than i would have thought looking in from the outside. they do have a large variety of toppings, and also build your own salads as well as pizza. the pizzas were also pretty big, and plenty enough to share or have leftovers for later, and at only 7.99, a pretty good deal for that size.the reason for the 3 stars though, is just the pizza wasnt that great in my opinion. i agree with a few others who have pointed out that they are very skimpy with the toppings. i did ask for more of a couple things, but you can tell they are told to not give you much to begin with. the cheese house blend did not taste super fresh, more like what you would get out of a bag in a store, just pretty basic.however the big thing for me was the crust. i am really picky about crust and theirs was premade, and pretty blah. not terrible, but pretty much just there to hold toppings. there isnt a pizza oven, and i feel that makes a huge difference in getting a good pizza and crust. custom built had a great crust, made in a pizza oven, and pizza kitchen just cant compare at all with the conveyor heat system they have going on in there.i think overall, its just fine for the price, and not a bad addition to chipotlepanera level of lunch, but if you are picky about quality and crust, you may be a little disappointed.
aok!  and what a great turnout.  if this place wasnt such a drive for me id give it that 4th star that they probably deserve.  it just seemed like quite a trek for what i got.  i should have checked the location before i asked to come.  but beggars cant be choosers, and i loved the hospitality.  i had a great time, cool venue, and there was plenty to do.  im not complaining, it was just quite a hike for someone that lives on the north side of town.  i hope this comes off as constructivecritiquing, not hating.  much respect to nikki, the venue, and yelp in general.this place is pretty cool.  if i was a steele creek resident i would be super thrilled about a place like this opening.  there are plenty of places to eat in the area, but its nice to see something to do.  and with the size of this place they can keep a lot of people happy.  bowling lanes, pool tables, ping pong, shuffleboard, and even some video games to keep you occupied.  all laid out with room to actually move around, although our pool tables were a little cramped.as per the food, i enjoyed it, but i would have liked to have tried more of the menu.  it was quite some time before i was even able to find one bite and had come in hoping to be able to get full.  once i did it was fried chicken, which i never got, fried chicken in a wrap, and fried fish, which didnt really show me what a lot of what all they could do.  i did get some of that beer cheese though, and yeah, it was pretty awesome.  serving fish and grits without silverware was kind of weird, but me licking my plate showed my dedication to giving everything a try.  i looked at the menu and almost ordered something, but my plus 1 had to leave.  as far as the booze goes a little more diversity than one beerthey ran out of the hummingbird very quickly would have been nice as well.i know people that live in the area and i will tell them to check it out.  id be down to come back if already in the area, but doubt id make the drive just to come here.  im not trying to be deby downer here, i think im just spoiled.  much love and respect to all who made this happen, i know a lot of work went into it.
it was good....but nothing special. ..had the portable lo bruschetta appetizer and it was very good...has a pesto chicken pizza...never found any chicken on it but plenty of pesto, got thin crust bad idea..way to crunchy, but the pizza over all.was ok. good wine selection as well as beer but they dont brew their own beer which sucks. undecided if well come back again or not.
for my personal tastes, their coffees were roasted too long.  most coffees that i looked at were roasted to at least full city, maybe beyond.  the owner and barista were nice, but didnt really seem to know too much about coffee.  the roaster looked good, but they werent roasting when i was in there.  based on the previous reviews, i was expecting a hip and cool roastery.  unfortunately, i found a coffee shop that happened to have a roaster  not sure if they know how to fully use it.  i had an espresso that was overextracted and a pourover coffee which had minimal flavor.  a bit disappointed, but again, some of my review is based on my personal taste for coffee.followup on this review 11102015:  i received a nice note from joseph, the roast master at desert wind.  he and i chatted on personal preferences on coffee, and i certainly enjoyed hearing more about how theyre roasting to their clienteles preferences.  for me, and as i noted above, that wasnt my preferred flavor profile, but it was obvious that joseph really cared about roasting coffee and wanted to provide the best coffee he could for his customers.  he even went as far as to describe which coffees, no matter the roast level, would be most appropriate for the espresso machine.  i only wish that id received that advice while i was in his shop.  ill be back in vegas and will give another try to desert wind and will try to come in when i can meet joseph.
i got the green shake and hummus and pita. the shake was good. not great, but good. id get it again for sure. the pita came out and looked really tasty. i was very hungry so i dug in right away. there was two flavors of hummus, plain and maybe red pepper? they were both super bland. no flavor whatsoever and a weird consistency. not smooth and yummy but kind of dry and grainy. a little olive oil was drizzled on top but even that didnt give it any flavor. dont be afraid of garlic and spices!! a little salt and pepper even? idk, i might come back for a smoothie but i doubt ill try the food again.
so despite my excitement and anticipation of shopping at a new store i was left feeling like i just wasted an hour of my day, they do not accept credit for purchases. cash, debit or check only. so before you go in there and spend an hour shopping and then hit the checkout lane only to look like a fool by not being able to pay for the purchase make sure you know this first. i had to edit my review from previous as i claimed they dont have this no credit accepted posted at the entrance to the store, indeed they do, my apologies winco foods.
ive shopped at winco in the past. tbh, its not replacing my store... frys. with the great discounts on gasoline and my frys app download coupons... winco doesnt save us money. plus they dont have several items we use. their meat selection isnt anything to write home about. most of their non food items are actually more expensive than frys or even albertsons. the cashiers are not very friendly at all.
this place is huge!  service was non existent until youre at the register.  i came in to pick up something for my hubby since he didnt get to come on this trip.  the place was clean and organized but thats about all i can tell you.  and of course everything cost an arm  a leg.  45 for a shirt off the clearance rack.  my hubby needs to find a new hobby.
this is a big dealership, lots of room for new and used bikes and everything harley. the guy that helped us in the clothes section was awesome, i was trying to get my family shirts, he was very helpful. 5 stars for this guy.not so much on the bike floor, had a couple of questions, no one seemed they wanted to help me. whatever, when i got back home, my harley dealer answered them for me.too much hype.
went on a sunday afternoon and they were out of boba. first boba place ive been to that ran out of boba. a sign would have been nice. sad face.
had an appointment in the san tan village which is the only reason i hit up fat straw since its super far away from my normal hood. the place is cute and very clean and modern  fyi its across from american eagle in close proximity to the movie theater. i got their version of a thai tea over ice i think they called it a high thai or something with honey boba. they only have two sizes a regular fat and a baby fat props for a cute name but honestly the size of this container is pretty ridic i got the regular fat which does not fit in my cup holder and is sort of an odd amount of liquid. the tea was really tasty and the boba was actually really good but at 5 dollars i felt the serving was kind of small and unfulfilling hence the 3 stars. probably wont be going back unless im close by or they open a scottsdalephx location.
my first experience at fat straw was great. one of the employees really took the time to explain the menu and suggest drinks. the boba was fresh and the teas were good. we decided to go back the following week but this time wasnt such a great experience. i ordered two large drinks but while i was waiting, they told me they didnt have enough black tea to make my drinks and asked if i wanted something else. i thought about it but nothing else sounded good so i said no thanks expecting to get my money back. the girls just stared at one another for a while before one of them came up to me and handed me a card for a free drink and she said heres this, since we didnt have black tea, well give you a free drink next time. i said ok but i ordered two drinks. she said yeah, we had enough tea for your drink so we still made it. thanks but now its super awkward because im walking out of there with a drink but nothing for my husband. i didnt get a refund, instead they made it seem like they did me a solid by giving me a free drink next time but i dont even plan on going back.
last month my wife and i had a sub par experience with a couple of the new employees. i posted a lengthy review and to my surprise, the manager reached out and messaged me a nice apology.  its refreshing to see a business that takes customer feedback so seriously. my wife and i are going to give this place another try and hopefully enjoy a tasty treat.
first off, im from california, so my boba standard is sort of obnoxious. as a bobabubble tea expert, im going to say that the boba here needs a lot of work. they claimed to have honey boba. i thought it was more soggy boba. hopefully this will improve over time because they are still pretty new!atmosphere: clean, hip, typical asian boba shop kinda feel. good for social gatherings for small groups.service: since theyre so new, the servers seem like they are a little clueless about the menu. they do have a lot of people working at once, so your drinks will be made promptly. we came in with a pretty big group for 89 people and they handled that well!drinks: you saw my rant above about their boba quality...thai tea: yum! they got this right! it was perfect 55matchacha: decent 35their original milk tea i forgot the exact name 15 it was way too sweetoverall, pretty pricy for mediocre quality boba, but ill give them another try in the future and provide an update!!! i still have hope in arizonas boba quality!!!
a month ago my wife and i had a sub par experience at fat straw, i wrote a review. since then ive received a nice apology from management. i understand its hard to be confident that youre hiring the right people. its refreshing to see a business taking customer reviews so seriously. my wife and i decided to give the fat straw another chance and hopefully enjoy a tasty treat.
tried the new location at san tan with the family. weve had boba teas before from traditional places. i guess this places claim is the honey boba which is super sweet. if you are looking to suck sugar through a monster straw and pay higher than average prices...this is your place.  also, their menu is pretty confusing and their mostly teenage staff doesnt understand it well enough to explain it. if you are looking for a less gimmicky boba in the gilbert area, i suggest trying bosa donuts.
eh...probably just not for me. boba was nice but the jellies are super weird. it was pretty sweet as well. i normally dont like very sweet things. place was clean and staff was friendly. i probably wont be back because its just not my style.
i worder to go. overall i think the hostess should work a little better on customer service. food was okay expected more mexican flavors... was a little americanized. i will go and dine soon.
i was really apprehensive to try this place based on the comments made by my neighbors in the next door app. im glad i gave it a shot because this grocery store is really nice. the produce is nice about the same quality as the old albertsons but there is much more variety. the heirloom tomatos are amazing. the only reason i took two stars off is because their premade food is beyond awful. i purchased a few prepare salads and sandwiches in their deli section and had to throw them all away. they should consider looking into their supplier because both of my salads just tasted rotten. after a few bites i just threw all the premade food away. i dont trust it. the best buy date on the packages were a minimum of 4 days from when i tried them but there was just something off about all of it.im not going to judge the whole store based on that experience. i just know now that im better off makng my own lunches.
this was an albertsons before haggen came to town. didnt care for it much then, but learned to love as a haggen. pretty sad now that they are going out of business. sad because the employees that once had job security with albertsons lost that when haggen took over. sort of reminds me of when albertsons sold locations to raleys years ago. same thing happened.outside of that, this had become one of my regular stops after work. i liked what they had done to the place after taking over. it was much cleaner and welcoming afterwards. now i guess i will just have to wait and see what comes in its place. for now, this place is quickly looking like a rundown factory store. cold, empty and a ghost town feel. sad.
im giving this place 3 stars because they really do good work...but im only giving them 3 stars instead of 5 for the following reasons: they are pricey...they charge for everything..they charge 5 to remove the gel even if you are getting it put on again they blantenly talk about you....and dont try to hide it........and they play funeral music.. ugh.. but they do great work and the guys sean, john, and fran are amazing and do great work...and are entertaining!!
i was not nearly as bowled over by this place as i wanted to be....met up with a dear friend on sunday for hash...one of my favorite dishes in the world.  i arrived early and got seated immediately.  our server gave me water, then ignored me for the next 20 minutes.  luckily the owners wife came by and got me some coffee, which was great.my friend arrived and we ordered as our server had miraculously appeared.  he seemed to have a limited knowledge of the menu as he could make few recommendations and told my friend that the restaurant didnt make something that was clearly on the menu.we both ordered hash...mine was crab with sweet potato and my friends was traditional.  mine was bland and flavorless; i ordered a side of hollandaise to spice it up but it had no flavor either.  both of us agreed that texture also played a big part in our overall dissatisfaction as well.as the queen of brunch, i fully expected to be able add hash kitchen to the restaurant rotation but am not thinking so now.  bummer.
good location and they have done a nice job renovating it into a upscale brunch spot. blood mary bar was obviously the focal point of the restaurant. for the price, there were plenty of options to dress up your beverage. well done. staff was friendly and pleasant and we had good service. the food was ok. the lump crab hash was mushy and bland. great presentation in cast iron skillet but poached eggs over cooked. the lump crab eggs benedict suffered from the same over cooked poached eggs and dry biscuit.
my wife and i came here for the first time about 2 weeks ago. it is a beautiful place. very scottsdale. the food was just ok. we had the the hash, eggs bennie, biscuits and gravy and bacon. the bacon was amazing! the brisket hash was good, not great needed seasoning badly, my wife said the eggs bennie was not that good. she said the hollandaise sauce lacked flavor and seasoning and was quite bland. i would say that this is an issue other yelpers have noticed but it doesnt seem that the chef is reading these reviews. i did speak with the server about the issue directly so hopefully it will finally get address. this place could be amazing, but right now they are just 35. service was 55. we had no wait and the place was essentially empty on a wed. morning.
this place is average. nothing mind blowing about it. nothing to take us back to it. the pancakes were dry. ihop pancakes are better. the breakfast burrito was dry. it needs a sauce or cream, something to add moisture to it. the orange juice was not freshly squeezed. the service was great though. our waitress was friendly and attentive. its not her fault the food is soso.
walked in to club music with a dj and turntable. a lively, fun atmosphere. call me a grouch, but im not looking for a ton of fun with my breakfast. i really like the menu and it has everything you want. i got the choose your own frittata, which i havent seen before. mine had smoke salmon, spinach, and tomatoes. it was good although when i think lox, i think smoke salmon. here it is just cooked salmon which is smoked because they own the bbq place next door. hashbrowns are just diced potatoes in a cup, they were ordinary. the fruit cup instead of the biscuit cost 2. the clincher, which i have read in other reviews is i couldnt get more coffee. maybe i should have been dancing,  waving my empty coffee cup.
its good but pricier than other frozen yogurt!.50 oz and others are about .32 ozflavored are good and its close by.  love the area and its cute area to hang out with a pizza place opening next door and a dunkin donuts.
crazy girls closed just before the riviera closed and it has moved and is open at planet hollywood in the sin city theatre on the mezzanine level.  the show is somewhat like it was in its rivera days.  there are 6 womenone being the vocalist for the groupand they perform various tease numbers and remove their tops near the end of most of the sets.my favorite number was something titled i want a cowboy.  the carousel horse was a little funky but the ladies did the routine well.  the weakest was a giant phallus that eventually launched some streamers into the audience startling some of the women in the audience.at the end of the show, the comic, tony leonard, who does a few bad jokes and some magic during the show which gives the ladies time to change between sets, announces that you can get photos of the crazy girls outside the showroom after the show.  when i went to take a photo, i was approached by one of the ladies informing me i needed to buy a 20 souvenir and then i could take a photo.  i passed.the show is ok but there are other topless shows in  las vegas that are superior to this.  no ifs, ands, or butts about that!
yelp apparently is treating the show as a different show than when it used to be at the riviera.  i updated my review on the old one before realizing this so i am copying it here.i really dont understand some of these reviews.update:  now that they have moved to the planet hollywood i retract all my gripes about the theater and i have raised my rating because of this.the girls all have hot bodies, their faces arent anywhere near as hot.  there is some criticism from other reviewers about them having athletic bodieswhat do you expect of dancers?  you normally dont find big boobs on bodies like that unless theyre implants and im not going to gripe about a woman not having implants.  theyre down to 5 from the iconic 7, plus one singer that never takes anything off and the magician.update:  the singer now gets pretty revealing.i also cant understand the review that said the show is tame and doesnt show much.  by the end of a number the dancers are usually reduced to a pretty skimpy lower garment or even fleshcolored gstring, sometimes they are also wearing some purely ornamental stuff that doesnt cover anything.  two numbers ended with the girl both were solo acts wearing nothing at all, remaining within the letter of the law local law permits full nudity or alcohol, not both only by careful positioning.as for the warning about the penis pillow, dont worry about it.  it only shoots paper streamers, being hit is of no consequence.
this show was just ok.  the theater is small which makes for a nice, intimate show.  the dancers were in very good shape and had dancers bodies.  i just couldnt really get into most of the songs.  i realize its an older vegas show so not all of the songs will be recognized, but i think i knew 3 songs out of a hour and a half show.  i wouldnt recommend it, but others may enjoy it.  i preferred fantasy to this a million times over.
every single person who works here has their phone attached to them. i stood and waited for the cashier to finish his text so i could order. instead of a hello. i got, oh, sorry.at least he said sorry, i guess.i ordered a bbq  burger, and upgraded to the combo fries and a drink for about 3, yes.... 3 more. ge told the cook, who was also bent over a counter, texting, my order.a little while  later, i walked up to get my order. before the kid could reach for his phone, again, i asked for my drink. another oh, sorry.now to the food.... the bun was fluffy,  and the bbq sauce had a decent amount of flavor, without being something crazy. the fries were fluffy as well....but needed some serious flavor after coming out of the fryer. some salt would have hone a long way. for around 7, id rather spend the extra 3 and get greek food a few feet away.
my mom and i were at the mall and we decided to have lunch here.  the spot used to be a mcdonalds and is now this place.  the cashier took our order right away.  we then had to wait quite a bit of time for our food.  not sure why since they were not busy.  maybe it just took a bit of time to cook the burgers.i had the mushroom burger with no cheese and a side of onion rings.  the burger was nicely cooked.  could have been a bit juicer and needed more mayo.  the onion rings were crispy, not too greasy and had a nice flavor.  and they are served with ranch dressing.  yum.my mom had the bbq burger with fries.  she thought the burger was good and the fries were tasty.  nice and crisp, soft on the inside.if we are at the mall again, we definitely will try this place again.
at the mall with the fam and my son wanted a burger.  i tried dairy queen and the employee pointed me towards burger factory and said that was the only place to get burgers in the food court.  we ordered the kids meal.  it was a small burger, drink and fries.  perfect for him.  the burger and fries were nothing special but they did the trick.  i would come back again if at the mall and the kids want a quick burger.
the food is good but the service sucks! they only gave me 2 napkins for four people and when you ask for more they give you an attitude! i understand that as a business you have to save money but service comes first!
they have great pizza good food and great drinks its easy fast and everything came out great warm
while attending the all american foodie fest we had the opportunity to try rolling fusion. my fella and i tried the thai fried chicken tacos. they were good. small, but good. the chicken had good flavor. they were a little on the dry side and i had hoped for more of a coconut flavor. if i ever tried them again id likely ask for more sauce to use as a dip.the service was friendly and we didnt have to wait long for our food like other food trucks we have tried in the past.
oh good, theres actually a business listing already for this. i didnt know how id caution people away otherwise.i seem to be starting an unfortunate pattern of having notsogreat experiences when i go off friends ideas. i love my friends still, but i was expecting something better from rolling fusion today. after all, they were at the great american foodie fest, and they showed up to sunset parkd today with a similar if not identical menu.their menu items almost all come in the form of three tacos, and that made sharing within the trio of my friends and i convenient. my choice was the skirt steak tacos 9, and one of my friends went for the thai fried chicken tacos 9.the skirt steak tacos looked promising with chimichurri, roasted corn spread, and fried plantain, lettuce, and queso fresco listed as ingredients. the flavors just seemed muted overall. the meat was not flavorful on its own, and the sauce elements and whatnot did not bestow enough flavor to make it taste like much. i was really disappointed in the lack of corn flavor in particular. the tortilla was seemed most prominent to my taste buds, and unfortunately, they didnt really oilgrill up those starchy suckers. its a shame.the thai fried chicken tacos were better. i got more mileage out of the coconut milk, lemongrass, honey wasabi, and green papaya slaw. the chicken breading was nice and crunchy too. still, its not comparable to any good thai dishes in the various restaurants of that sort available in town, and i wouldnt get it again or recommend it.this is more of a 2.5 rating, but im giving rolling fusion some sympathy since they look like a familyrun business. i hope they work on improving their recipes, and i do wish them success because of the promise of their concepts, but they probably wont find much support on my dime.
the service was pleasant, nothing to complain about. the food was mediocre, above price that what we got. at least the food was hot and the biscuits were really good.
ok the food was good.  but thats about all i can say, which i suppose is important considering it is a restaurant.   but.....  i expect a lot more from a restaurant  especially a new one listed as hot and new at the time.   yep, i will go on about this, anyone who reads my reviews will hopefully get it.1. music.  im not just saying i didnt like the music.  there was something  really wrong with the sound system like someone disconnected a wire and only half of the frequencies were coming out of some fried wire behind the furnace??.  i swear it wasnt just me.  my friend who was with me works in music and even offered to go fix the system for them.  it was so bad i felt kind of queasy or bad trip or something. completely distracting, especially combined with........2 yelling! every time anyone would walk in the door there was some sort of yelling they did.i understand if it was one of those places that had games or an mc or whatever they have this crap in north hollywood but this is like the outskirts of las vegas  and also florescent lighting,  totally please no.   3 the all you can eat rules and regulations.  im not an all you can eat person.  first of all, i cant eat very much and second because i dont like rules!   these rules were so confusing and restrictive.  they could not totally explain them maybe because its a new place? yet, anything we asked for seemed to be impossible. also, there were all these stipulations written in chalk on some blackboards near the ceiling.  i just wanted a tuna roll with avocado, but that turned into a humongous discussion i finally gave up and got shrimp hibachi.  then i spent a long time looking for a shrimp within a sea of diced zucchini.  on the more positive side, its 2 for 1 saki and  there was some sort of shrimp roll that everyone in the entire place was going crazy for.  i just dont order shrimp rolls.  so maybe im the problem!!!?i feel a little bad saying all this, hence the 3 stars rather than 2, mainly because the staff was super nice and obviously trying very hard to please everyone.  i hope they can work out the sound system thing.  also, its right next to a big movie theater so its technically a good dinner and a movie place!   follow chalk instructions, wear earplugs, the theater is 2nd run movies so tix are cheap.  i would go again, but not on purpose...... or get take out.  truth be told, we were aiming to go to the thai place next door which is for some reason closed on tuesdays.  wow.
dined on a saturday evening and this place was dead with only one table occupied. came based on the very positive reviews and location at village square on sahara is near home.service was attentive but wouldnt categorize it as warm and friendly.  we didnt get water refills until the end of the meal and when we finally asked.  food came out quickly  hot foods hot.adults got the ayce option. kids opted for a chicken katsu kids meal and ala carte shrimp tempura and salmon sashimi. sashimi was 11 and seemed spendy for the three pieces. most of the sushi here is pretty mediocre. not bad, but its not knock your socks off.  the creative rolls like the sunset were unimaginative and just alright.  we got an order of spicy tuna nachos. guess we shouldve known based on the menu see picture, but it was literally a heaping mound of spicy tuna served with something like sriracha mayo and tostitos scoops yes, straight from the bag of scoops that you would eat with jarred salsa. the spicy in the tuna wasnt even mixed evenly as the bottom of the lump was spicier than the top.the honey toast is a poor representation of this great japanese dessert. it was not japanese bakery bread but a piece of kings hawaiian sweet roll. the ice cream wasnt vanilla like described. it was more like a yuzu sorbet, but i thought it was better than vanilla ice cream. the sorbet was the best thing we had that night.one of the tips mentioned the bench seating for each table. not ideal but it wasnt too bad.doubt well be back here despite the convenience. there are many other ayce joints in town to choose from which youll leave much more satisfied.
this place took the spot of 808 sushi  tapas, so i figured they had to be really good. we decided to do ayce. the food was good, but what killed it was the service. while the owner was kind, our server was probably not having a good day. it made our experience unpleasant. we had to ask for water multiple times. i dont know... maybe the just need more help?
sushi really small portions but the appetizers here were good.  soft shell crab, salmontuna poke were decent as were the skewers. had a sushi craving but it didnt satisfy.  it wasnt horrible but doubt ill ever come back.  if you want more sushi then youll be disappointed. all hot items were pretty good though
appetizers were good. sushi was ok. desert was gross. much better sushi available in the valley for the price. recommend the butter grilled mushrooms and tempura.
overall the place was pretty average. long story short, the appetizers were awesome, the sushi was subpar, and the desert was horrible. the place was really loud too. the prices are also more expensive than other all you can eats and too many items are a la carte only.long story long, read on.first, the restaurant itself. it has a nice, modern, clean vibe and look to it. the staff were friendly. one complaint was the music was way too loud. it was hard to have a normal conversation without raising our voices, so we kindly asked if they could turn the volume down. instead, the waitress asked if we wanted to move to a different table. since the volume level is pretty much the same no matter where you are there, that perplexed us and we stayed put. prices are steeper here. lunch is 22 and dinner is 28. thats 3 more than average. several items are a la carte only that are typically included at other allyoucaneat places albiet often one order only, though that have some special items that justify it like real kobe beef. house sake was also 6 for a small and 9 for a large, which is also about 3 more expensive than other places. note that there is a 2 for 1 deal for sake or beer if you check in on yelp, so that helps.onto the food. they have a decent variety of appetizers, including some with enoki mushrooms which you dont usually see. we tried a wide variety of them and everything was well prepared, well portioned, and delicious. the tempura based items were particularly tasty. we were happy campers so far.our nigiri sushi orders came out and our enthusiasm dropped. the quality of the fish was fairly good, but the pieces were fairly small, and the fish was cut very thin. they were about 90 rice and 10 fish. the rolls we received were also pretty stingy with the fish as the cuts on top were equally thin, and the fish inside was small compared to the other filler items. when compared to places like sakana or sasa who are very generous with their fish portions, it was very disappointing.after getting full on mostly rice, we asked for dessert. this is when things got pretty dire. i got the vanilla ice cream with macaroons, and my friends got green tea and strawberry mochi. my ice cream was partially translucent and looked more like a sorbet, like it was dairy free. worst vanilla ice cream ever. the macaroon also tasted kind of like garlic, which was really strange. im guessing it had been stored next to it and the garlic flavor creeped in. the green tea mochi was horrid. the rice covering was crumbly and had a rough texture. the ice cream was neon yellowish green, had a weird texture, and tasted funny. the strawberry mochi was better at least, but not great.one other minor gripe was with the mens bathroom. the urinal wouldnt flush, and the toilet paper felt like it was from 1970s soviet russia. at least it was clean.the staff were friendly and attentive outside of the issue with the loud music, and one of the chefs personally said goodbye to us as we were walking out.we give it a 2 12 out of 5. definitely not the worst place ive been to, but theres definitely room to improve, and there much better places like sasa and sakana, which are also cheaper. if they do a better job with fish portions, desserts, bring the prices down a bit, and turn the music down, well be keen to return. until then well stick with sasa and sakana as our main places.
had a large party for dinner at hanabi on a saturday night, my second time there:welcomed our group of 20 folks.great selection for ayce.met chef andy, who was a delight and also provided complimentary champagne for my birthday.took a while to take our orders, and for some reason took only the ayce orders first majority, and didnt come back to get the a la carte people until much later.one of our party did not get even half of their ayce order brought to his table, nor was any apology given or ammends made when he brought it to their attention.we did not get all of the ayce items the waitress wrote down that we ordered.i didnt appreciate being asked who in my party left a poor yelp review, and nothing done to encourage that person to return. a compd meal? a gift cardcertificate? dessert on the house?a birthday card of mine was trashed, not saved by the staff.
it was fresh and yummy but many things need to be order a la carte i think they need only all you can eat menu. that makes my feel not good.
i liked this place  enjoyed their sushi here. my friends and i had ayce sushi and shared with each other all that we ordered. they even have all you can drink sake! lol! personally, all you can eatdrink is a bad combination but whatever floats your boat!the one thing i have to say about this place is that my brother and i both ordered the baked salmon roll and his came, but mine did not. i asked if mine was coming and the server said it was. 15 minutes later, the rest of our orders came and my baked salmon roll was still missing. so another server came and asked if we would like to order anything else, i then asked about my missing baked salmon roll, she said she would check on it  never returned for the rest of our dining. then, my friend ordered 4 rolls and only 2 returned. once we all decided we were finished eating, we still had not received our orders. my baked salmon roll never came and neither did her 2 other orders. all in all, i enjoyed my dining experience here, but i wish that they servers here put in effort to correctly bring out food out.
the ayce menu has a wide variety of food to choose from and even the dessert was included in the ayce, unlike other places weve been to. everything was very delish! the only thing was their hard but cute benches. tables were a bit small with all the little dishes on the table party of 4 but most of all, my butt started hurting after a while due to the hardness of the bench. also it being a bench, theres nothing to lean back on so for people who like to lean back, theyre out of luck.everyone in my party had the ayce and i had the sushi bento because i just cant eat enough to make the ayce price worth it for me. my bento was good good good!they had nice music on but they could have toned down the volume. it was too loud for our conversations.
another decent ayce spot. this one takes over the space formerly occupied by 808 tapas. hanabi has a fairly large menu with some items only available a la carte. nigiri is the way to go here. the quality is pretty good for an ayce place. rolls on the other hand werent my favorite. some, like the yellowtail special with cooked shrimp, jalapeno, cilantro, cucumber topped with yellowtail, ponzu, habanero, were too hot for my tastes. the tiger roll shrimp tempura, crab topped with spicy tuna with eel sauce was the best of the bunch, the mad caterpillar fresh water eel and cucumber topped with spicy tuna, spicy eel sauce was decent, and the crispy tuna scallion was not good with tuna that looked and tasted liked canned tuna. as a whole, the rolls seemed hastily crafted and lacked the precision of superior rolls found elsewhere.2.5 stars
went for dinner tonight with the wife and kids. this place just opened three or four days ago and was absolutely packed! it also didnt help that it was about an hour before asu  wisconsin kicked of at sun devil stadium about a mile down the road in tempe. service was amazing. but with the approximately 70 employees i saw, anything less would have been unacceptable. shit, i counted about 15 management and corporate types alone all gathered around patting themselves on the back. unfortunately, the service is where the amazing ended. food was...average. one of our daughters wanted chicken tenders, and they were among the worst id ever had. onion rings sucked too. my wife and i each had a jumbo and they were ok  but certainly nothing even remotely close to special. if youre looking for better, it shouldnt be too hard to find. teds in tempe has far better dogs and onion rings. and if its chicago dogs youre looking for, jimmys at 40th and bway is vastly superior.
it was good.  the burger tasted charbroiled and delicious.  the onion rings were crispy and great.  the drive thru was awkward  and a little uncomfortable...forced conversation as three young men stand by your car as you wait for your order..... but they were very nice and professional.... get the poor guys a car port so they arent melting on the az heat!
looove a good chicago dog so decided to try it out. just as others have said, the food here is fine, good, average. the jumbo dog was good, but nothing special. i can truthfully get a better hot dog right down the street or at any costco.i also got the italian beef. that was better, but again, nothing to write home about. chocolate malt was good. i ordered the large which is enough for 3 people. i will probably go back, but dont see it being a regular stop. worth a try to figure out yourself.
im not gonna lie, i mean, this place wasnt half bad but theres definitely some room needed for improvement. ill give it a few months and itll be an amazing restaurant. but anywho, i went to the new tempe location, its super nice at least from the outside, and i love that there is a drivethru! the waitresses were really nice and quick and our food came fast so that was awesome. i had the halibut fish sandwich. i mean, it tasted pretty average. very similar to a wendys fish sandwich. on the downside, it was really messy. way to much mayo and tartar sauce, i literally couldnt wipe it off with a napkin. but the fries and onion rings were awesome and my boyfriend loved the italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers and the breaded chicken on croissant. this place is really cool, i will just give it some time to get itself established :
good burger, expected italian beef to be better. no gardinera, would probably made it better. good prices for portion size. plenty of seating inside and out.
hello all you arizona foodies!being from chicago as many of us are, i was at the scottsdale opening of portillos and was blown away at how organized they were.the orders came out right and the lines moved swiftly so when tempe location opened i just assumed it would be just as organized...not!the food is the same as scottsdale and chicago but this place was one hot mess!therefore portillos has lost 2 stars from my scottsdale review.the parking is not great but the worst part is when you wait for your order.you are standing in a small and very crowded area waiting for your number to be called and it was not pleasant experience.so the next 2 times i went i chose drive thru... this was the wrong choice....but you dont find that out until you get home and find you have the wrong order......so, what do i do?  i call the manager and told him how unhappy i was that i just drove 25 minutes to get portillos and get home to find the wrong order.here comes the truly ridicioulous part.... they dont say, come back and we will give you the correct order...no.... that is too easy, they take your name and information and send it to the corportate office and in a couple weeks you will get a gift card to replace the dinner you never got due to their incompetence!so, i call the corportate office myself and ask why they inconvenience the customer by not replacing the order without having to go thru this riga a maro.. her response was that the store managers were not taking proper notes of people they owed replacements to and that caused problems....so of course it makes perfect sense to put the customer out of the way instead of just properly training their management on how to take correct notes!i love portillos and have for many years but is it worth spending money on food you are not getting?no doubt i will continue to go back but... i will hold up the line to make sure my order is correct....instead of trusting the employees are doing their jobs correctly.also... be careful when you order little side items such as au jus.. between both locations i have paid for their sides many times but never received them in my order.the food is chicago good but the management is not!try it... you will come back for the authentic chicago food.and so i end by saying....live each day as though it were your last and enjoy!bon appetite
i dont quite get the hype here, its a hot dog. sure its not a bad weiner  i personally prefer teds  and its an interesting experience. but i think its a bit overrated and the wait was excessively lengthy. not a bad place for some interesting people watching though. ill be back, but next time im going to try something different.
hooray! i dont have to go all the way to chicago to get portillos anymore! fantastic italian beef sandwiches, and onion rings for which its worth driving all the way to arizona. go get some!
i tried the polish dog and it was pretty decent. it is a bit expensive when you got to order everything seperate. maybe i didnt see a combo meal price, but for a hot dog, fries and drink came out to over 8 dollars.  i also was a bit annoyed in the drive thru a employee stands out side to give you your order, which makes it akward when he is talking to you, when all you want is your food and go. it was nice gesture but a bit annoying. i will go back to try other menu items.
first things first. i am saddened by the fact they refuse to offer sauerkraut ! apparently thats not an illinois thing! but i do love their menu overall: i try to be sodium friendly and though this is not, i would recommend the salads they have.i wish that they had a few more  locations throughout the valley but tempe is a good location. it is busy here still after the grand opening and it may be a good thing to consider a late lunch to avoid some of the crowd.
the wife and i had dinner with our daughter and boyfriend. daughter been telling me for a few months on how we need to try this place. since her boyfriend is from the chicago area, of course she is going to be bias with this place. now i had their beef n cheddar on a croissant. its their italian beef sandwich with cheese on a croissant. sounded really great, ask for it to be dry!  sandwich was alright, glad i tried it. next time ill have the regular italian beef sandwich. this sandwich was pretty wet for it to be dry? wife really enjoyed it, had her favorite. hot dog wmustard, shared that with the daughter. she also had their cheeseburger, tasted like a whopper! we all shared a chili cheese fries, daughter did not like it, it was ok with me, but next time need to tell them to hold off the salt! for me, this place is ok. i have had better, but really nothing to complain about. has a lot of options, and a neat place to visit.
the food is good its just like you would get off of a hot dog cart. i didnt think it was anything special.
since moving to arizona i have started disliking midwestern people who flock to the area. the country is not supposed to have the same food in every state. well, all the chicago folks whined and moaned and now they have their famous hot dog joint popping up all over and they shoved a new cubs stadium down mesas throat. so you put different toppings on a hot dog  we didnt need a whole chain to figure that out people. that being said, i was hungry and there was no line at the drive through, so here we go. i avoided the dogs and the beef because it looked fatty and undercooked in photos. the salads on the other hand have some potential. the salad dressings though do not match the quality of salads. the first two ingredients in the house dressing are corn oil and vegetable oil..yumm, and the dressing tasted mechanical or metallic. the salad itself was loaded with mostly good quality chicken chunks, some cheese and lots of veggies. it wasnt bad and they included a lemon poppyseed muffin in the bag which was a nice touch. i will return and switch dressings, but for a fast food joint, these 7 salads are very good and you get your moneys worth.
i know this place gets a ton of hype from midwesterners but not sure i get it. my food was good and we got it fast, but its not a destination restaurant for me. i ordered the cheeseburger, it was good. my husband got the italian beef and cheddar, he didnt like it. it is a great place for kids. we took two toddlers and were able to get in and out quickly plus its loud so their screaming didnt seem to disturb anyone. next time were in the area well probably try it again just for that fact alone.
the impression i got was high school hang out. like a place you and your buddies go on a friday or saturday night before you hit the movies at tempe marketplace before your parents pick you up behind the restaurant so no one can see you dont have a car.  ive never been to chicago so i have to take their word that it is just like what they serve there.  ive also never really been into hot dogs, much less hot dogs on steroids.  my brotherinlaw and i went there because he said it was good eats for cheap.  he was right.  the quantity of food you get is good.  they give you these little muffins with your salad that are tasty.  you can also get some pretty mean looking chili cheese dogs if youre brave enough.  i went a little more boring and got a chicken sandwich.  not the place you want to visit if youre looking to relax.  its extremely loud in there!  the patio is nice if you decide to sit outside.
not a fan. very average burger. big and greasy. there are a lot of better options for burgers. nice cold dietcoke. fries average also. what is good is that the food is fresh.  but maybe i ordered the wrong thing. next time i will go and have a salad. if i go back.
definitely dont live up to the hype. i rate it average at best! really nice establishment and the employees are nice. there is always to many people and food is ok but dont blow your socks off. i really dont understand why people act like this is so great. i was disappointed all three times!
every time my boyfriend and i swing by tempe marketplace, we always see portillos around and we would often wonder how this place would taste. we had never heard of portillos as were not from the chicago nor have we even visited there.however, it very much was how we both expected. its a very casual place where friends and family can settle down and have some fast food after a day of shopping. its a nice idea but its sort of out of the way for us since my boyfriend and i always go towards the main marketplace to shop or browse around.i ordered a hamburger while my boyfriend ordered a combo a hot dog with an italian sausage and some roast beef. we had initially thought the combo was going to come with some fries and a drink but only i got the fries, as it came with my meal apparently, and i had to order us a drink. its not a big deal or anything! i guess he and i misunderstood this kind of lingo, haha.the burger was okay; its a step up from mcdonalds but thats all i can really say about it. the fries were average, but both the burger and fries were at least fresh. the hot dog my boyfriend was surprisingly good  only because weve been burnt before with restaurants who try to mimic others only in looks and not taste.if were not really feeling the other restaurants in tempe marketplace, i believe wed come here just to get more of those infamous hot dogs.
first time eating here and it was okay. i ordered double burger with onion ring. onion ring was tasteless and not worthy of ordering. i went and order french fries and it was delicious. burger was just average.i like that it is big and has patio with heaters. plus they have salad and dessert bars.
it is honestly ridiculous that you refuse to do any separate orders at the drive through. i get it, you have a weird ticket, radio in the hot dogs system, but just put two tickets down. it is not difficult. drivethrough restaurants have been doing it for years. its one thing to set a limit of maybe three or four orders per car, but to just refuse to do two separate orders is nonsense.
havent had everything on their menu which is very extensive.  first item up.  chicago dog which i rate very highly.  the italian beef...ehh...not so much.  thought it lacked depth of flavor.  the cheese fries are unstoppable...although i dislike the fact that they serve the cheese up in a plastic cup on the side.  ive also had the halibut filet sandwich.  good not great.  the decor in this place is something to see.  heard so many good things about this place...been twice...and i am still on the fence on if i would go back.
its a great spot for shakes and hot dogs. i have tried a few of their sandwiches and asked for no gravy or light gravy and they still seem to saturate the bread with juice and leave it super soggy. yuck.otherwise, the jumbo chili dogs, fries, onion rings, and shakes are really yummy!
id go back if i was in a junk food mood but wouldnt go out of my way.  isnt all junk food about the same? finding it difficult to discern varying degrees of junk and nuances of grease. its as good as other chicago shops ive been too. but they are the original and from chicago so i guess they get extra points.
tried this place for the first time this weekend. i will say they do a wonderfully authentic chicago hot dog, which is the signature hot dog at portillos. i dont go to the mall too often but when i do, portillos would certainly be a reasonable option. for what it is, this is a good food experience and if you like hot dogs, you definitely should give this place a try. only thing, it would be nice if they had their menu online so one could say, preselect some healthier options and i am not sure they offer a veggie dog option. my parents are cutting meat out of their diet so a vegi dog would be a nice alternative.
after all the hype about portillos coming to tempe marketplace and the photos friends had posted on yelp, i was looking forward to trying this place. ive never been to chicago, but ive had a delicious chicago style hot dog before. i figured portillos had to serve up a hot dog better than the one i had from a food truck in phoenix. honestly, the one i tried tonight from portillos was not any better. on a positive note, the beef hot dog with everything 2.65 had good flavor with all the fixings: mustard, relish, freshly chopped onions, sliced red tomatoes, kosher pickle spear, and sport peppers. my primary complaint was that the perfectly steamed poppy seed bun was pretty soggy from all the fixings by the time i got home. it seems that the hot dog might best be enjoyed in the restaurant as the bun doesnt stand up very well  or maybe they should serve the fixings on the side for customers taking the hot dog togo. the onion rings 2.19 were pipping hot and crispy, but lacked much in the way of flavor  definitely nothing noteworthy. the customer service was excellent! the drive though service seemed like a soupedup version of the in  out experience: a person takes your order outside instead of an intercom at the menu, another person confirms your order and collects your payment also outside by walking up to your vehicle, finally a third person grabbed my order from the window and brought it to my car. this doesnt seem like the most efficient system and unlikely sustainable during the summer months but its a nice attempt to make the experience more welcoming and customerfocused. overall: good, not great experience tonight. i will return to try other offerings and reevaluate. thanks to a fellow yelper shoutout to irina, i was surprised to learn that they actually have vegetarian and pescatarian sandwiches which have received positive reviews. next time, maybe ill have to try the grilled tuna sandwich or the halibut sandwich!
this is one restaurant i feel doesnt live up to the hype. ive been there twice now. the first time i ordered a cheeseburger and it was okay. i did enjoy how they call out orders in rhyme and the look of the place. on my second visit, i tried out their big beef sandwich i saw advertised all over the building and my wife ordered one of their famous dogs. first of all, the lady taking our order had poor customer service skills. i simply asked if it came with or if i could order sweet onion sauce or any kind of sauce that would go well with my beef sandwich. she looked at me as if i was crazy for asking before telling me no such thing exists there. the sandwich itself was large but lacked any sort of real flavor, and the bun was soggy and dripping all over. my wife was equally disappointed in her hot dog, saying that it was smaller and not even as tastey as the 1 hot dogs at the local qt. needless to say, neither of us are in any hurry to return.
meh.  im not a big shake guy  but had heard rave reviews of their hot dogs.  i wont elaborate, but will say i was just underwhelmed in almost every way.  i did not feel the snap of the real casing on the dog itself, the toppings were sparse, the bun was soggy probably from the dog that came out of the steamer and it was just not impressive.  so i suppose if you are crazy about chocolate cake, you might want to ignore this review.  but if youre going for the dawgs, just dont bother  you can do better.
first time to portillos and its not worth the cost to go. you pay separate for everything you want and a burger alone was 7.50.  it felt more like a school cafeteria than it did a diner.  food was just ok. not anything that makes me have to go back because what they have and the taste can be found all over the valley.
im not sure i understand the mass appeal.  there are some things i think are really good and somethings that arent very good.  the good.  the menu is surprisingly diverse.  lots of options for different kinds of eaters.  they have a chocolate cake shake....how awesome is that?the not so good.  the burgers are very average. it was so busy that it was hard to find a table.     if you suspect you or a loved one might have a.d.d., take them here and you can save some money on paying a psychiatrist for a diagnoses.  there are posters everywhere and i almost feel like the lighting was funny, it almost hurt my eyes.  when they hand out orders, the girl comes over the speaker system and says something cheesy like order nine, time to dine for every order!!!!  it was kind of cute the first 40 times but after a while it became very distracting.  my senses were very overstimulated.  i am not completely knocking this place, obviously people like that kind of thing because it is crazy busy, but the ambiance was a little much for me.
im not from chicago, so please forgive me for not being very impressed, porteeyos hey, if you people from the midwest get to butcher our words, expect equal treatment. my vegetarian friends would probably like me to start with a clarification that fish  meat and is not, in fact, a meatless choice. sorry if this brings you down to only one veggie option instead of three, but it is what it is. speaking of clarifications, lets be clear that no one outside chicago expects radioactive looking relish, so some disclosure would have been appreciated. also, you could have warned me about the pickle and peppers that landed on the table when i tried taking my hotdog out of the bag  i wanted those things on the hotdog. other than that, this place is what it says it is. they sell hotdogs and other stuff, and it appears that they do a lot of this. it may be the biggest and busiest fast food restaurant ive ever visited. ill maybe be back if killing time in the neighborhood again, but wouldnt make a special trip.
just got done eating here about 30 min ago! my beef and my cheese fries were delicious! i have nothing bad to say about the food. however, my customer service was terrible!! i had ordered an italian beef, large cheese fries, and a chocolate milk shake. when digging for my money to pay i sadly noticed i only had enough money for an italian beef and a small cheese fry. i politely ask the cashier to downgrade the fries and take off the milkshake. he was just so unbelievably frustrated he was in no way cautions to hide it!! he sighed very loud right in front of me and then fallowed with an eye roll. then asked k. that it? with the biggest attitude. could not believe the way i was treated.
ew! dont get the beef and cheddar croissant, or maybe just dont ever get it togo! it was super soggy and wet, made me want to throw up. the sweet peppers i added gave it a little flavor, but the beef just wasnt that good. i only could stomach to eat half. i would go for an arbys sandwich over this any day. the onion rings were good, but how can you really mess up onion rings? am i right? service was good! they were friendly and fast, pretty efficient little routine they had going. just disappointed in the product. ill still go back... need to try out their dogs. its possible i just ordered the wrong thing.
the food tastes good and the themed decor is fun. the italian beef each time ive gotten it has been super soggy though and i really dont like that. its messy, it feels gross and is just generally unappealing.
here now for my first visit. pretty busy for a saturday 2pm. cashier was not friendly, actually didnt say a word except for my total. atmosphere is fun, employees did not look happy. tables were too close together. i had the italian beef wextra gravy. it was what i expected, nothing outstanding.  i also got a maxwell street polish which was not very good. it was super salty and didnt have much flavor aside from the char broil. it was loaded with well sauteed onions and some mustard.id go back if some out of towners want to try but i wont go out of my way.
me and my family of 5 went here for dinner because of the location near the tempe marketplace.  i was intrigued by the extensive menu and the reputation of a midwest restaurant chain.  so i ordered the combo beefchar grilled italian dog with peppers.  it tasted nothing special, like something youd buy at the store and make at home.  i was disappointed there wasnt much more dressingcondiments to choose from.  peppers or none. mustard had to be requested and it came from packets so no pump at the napkinstraw station. i did love the soft bread buns they came in though.. my husband ordered the italian sausage and also agreed, nothing special.  my son had the bacon burger and it was greasy but the bun covered the entire patty.  they have crinkle fries and cheese on the side for extra. oreida probably.  wed go here again if we were hankering for hot dogs next time.  we think the same of teds hot dogs down the street, nothing special.  but it could be more special if it were the spicesflavorings. the prices were appropriate and affordable and the ambience is great though. memorabilia and neon signs and pics of famous people who love the chain. i couldnt believe how busy they were on a saturday night.  clean bathrooms for when youre done eating those messy dogs, though!
really cool atmosphere!  but their hotdogs were just soso.  they didnt have much flavor.  id rather go to their competition down the street, pay the same thing, but miss the cool atmosphere.  might go again with a friend that has never been.
my sister and i ate here on friday and now have food poisoning. we shared a meal and havent seen each other since, but we both have food poisoning.my sister got it worse than me and she ordered a second sandwich to go and ate it later.the food was good but now im not so sure about the quality.
i think that this place is nostalgic for chicago people. not being from there, it was ok. fries were fair and the dip was ok. i got it dunked, but it was too wet. it wasnt bad, but it wasnt the greatest either. i will give it another shot just in case it was a bad day.
the food is good. no doubt. the service is painfully slow. as i write this its 2:30 on a sat afternoon and the place is mostly empty. weve been waiting for 20 minutes for two sandwiches and two hot dogs.
after reading joyce ws review, i starved myself all day so i could relive her experience in person.  upon walking in, i noticed the place was huge.  so many places to sit.  i liked the yesteryear vibe.  thankfully, i followed a young couple in, as i had no idea what to do.  i found out, you need to walk to the back of the restaurant to place your order.as i waited for my order to come up, i enjoyed the young lady calling out the tickets as they came up.oneninezero, youre my hero.  onenineone, your order is done.  oneninetwo, weve got an order right here for you. oneninethree, come see me. oneninefour, wait no more.   oneninefive, look alive.  oneninesix, come get your portillos fix.  onenineseven, i didnt hang long enough to hear this rhyme.  onenineeight, no more wait.  oneninenine, its your time to dine.  twoohoh, youre good to go.when i sat down with my order, i bit into the signature hot dog, and it has a good snap.  however, my beef and cheddar croissant was so greasy it literally turned its paper wrapping translucent.  i texted joyce a photo, and she remarked that they must hate me.  yes, of course, it all made sense now.  the bread was too thick for me, and i tossed most of it.  the crinkle cut fries were okay.  ill try the pasta, ribs or salad next time, with my dog.
been going here since they opened. decided to try the drive thru because i was in a hurry. i would have given a 5 star but was seriously irritated when i got home. how are you going to skimp me so bad on a large fry. ive ordered a small fry before and got more. the fact that the guy at the window double looked in the bag to make sure i had everything and saw this abomination of a large fry and still served it to me is even more irritating. had a chance to redeem yourself and totally blew it. some may say im going overboard a lil. but to pay 25 for a fry, 3 plain hot dogs, italian sausage and two drinks. i better get my moneys worth.
my vote is ok.  ive spent lots of time in chicago and despite coworkers rating it at you must try it, i didnt care to spend the time in line but when they opened up shop it town i gave it a try.  quality and freshness was good, service was entertaining.  glad i arrived for a slightly early lunch as it got crowded quickly near noon, not sure if ill be back.  shea location
wow, is this place loud.  met a friend i hadnt talked to in a while.  hard to get a sentence out without them calling number 47  come get some heaven  number 47 so loud you cant hear each other.the hot dogs are pretty good, but i really dont get it.
had a birthday lunch with a friend. guy who took the order was pleasant  patient as we checked out the options. had the grilled tuna sandwich  the beef  cheddar croissant, an order of onion rings and an order of fries. food was hot , everything seemed fresh, but the bread and croissant were yuk! both were soft and slimy in the mouth come on guys, your fillings are great, splurge on some decent bread!
went here with a group of 9 before an asu vball game. its a good place to grab a bite for such occasions. they have plenty of seating, enough selection for families and relatively fast service even when super busy on a saturday night. the food is ok, but take this as a fast food joint, not 5 star food. italian beef, cake shake and fries are top of the list, but they offer salads, smoothies and chicken sandwiches that are decent. i lived in chicago, so for me its about nostalgia, but im staying in the 3s none the less.
the jumbo hot dog hit the spot.  im not much of a hot dog fan, but the combination of the crunchy pickles, fresh onions and tomatoes, and peppers engulfing the hot dog on warm, soft bun was satisfying. 45 for the dog.i had high expectations for the italian beef sandwich, as previous tasters made me want to be a believer.  perhaps my tastes were spoiled by other types of dipped sandwiches, like at philippes or the hat, but i was not impressed with portillos offering.  i had mine topped with sweet peppers, and fully dipped.  the meat was moist and tender, and the bun had the salivating texture of a dipped sandwich, but overall the taste was lacking and almost bland.  im not a regular italian beef sandwich consumer, so maybe this is the standard. 25 for the disappointment, from an amateur italian beef eater.the chili cheese fries were filling.  im biased against crinkle cut fries. the chili was the thinner chili; no beansized chunks in this chili.  still satisfied the craving for chili cheese fries.  35.
the food was passable, but for the gas plus the cost of the meal, i probably wont be back any time soon. toms is closer to home with better italian beef. the italian beef was bland, and as for the tamale, well its not a mexican food restaurant. the servings are a good size for what you pay. i think im just used to more seasoning on my food than they use.
arrived at pan for dinner during a weeknight. the place was largely empty, although it did fill up a bit as we ate a leisurely meal. our server was very friendly, a big fan of the restaurant, and super informed about the dishes offered. we were advised to order in waves, and that worked out well, enabling us to eat just as much as we were comfortable with and to share all of our dishes.the dumplings werent a huge standout. your normal room temperature, pork  cabbage mixture. wrappers were on the loose side and most of them came apart before the chopsticks made it to our mouths. our server recommended the keylime scallop, and though we were super worried by the name, the dish was pleasantly temperate in the combination of its sweetness and acidity. the other rolls peppered tuna and angry snapper were oknothing dramatically amazing, but all the ingredients worked. like their predecessor, tamari, they seem to definitely be on the moreismore side of the sushi business with these rolls and their plentiful ingredientssauces. we definitely had some issues with the knifework on the very thick nigiri and the balance of vegetablessauce to fish was overpowering. it was really hard to really taste the unique flavor of the fish which is what good sushi is about, yeah? and the texture of the thick slices was somewhat unappealing. a good example was the yellowtail with a very strong pear and ginger slaw and a heavy eel sauce that completely hid the nuance of the orange zest and the fish itself. still, the white tuna nigiri was our favorite dish of the night, with the watercress and yuzu subtle enough to allow the flavor of the fish to show up.we also enjoyed the black cod and the fried shrimp, although these are two classic items on umis omikase menu and pans versions are nowhere in the same class. still, as budget versions, they were pretty tasty. the sablefish was tender and flavorful and the shrimp were on the spicy side, with a light fry. we found both the cocktails and desserts a bit mystifying. the balance and thoughtfulness of the cocktails was significantly off. in each one i tried, there was one ingredient overpowering the drink. made me glad i ordered wine for myself while my dining partners had to slog through to finish their drinks. the bizarre avocado cremebrulee thing really wasnt anything specialdidnt taste any different than your average, slightlygrainy restaurant offering. pricing was pretty good for the quality of the food.
wonderful, creative dinners and small plates.  they are also glutenfree friendly, using gf soy sauce, and our waitress was extremely knowledgable. my only complaint is that it is way, way too noisy.
i came here last week with a friend who was in from out of town.  we made a last minute reservation for a friday night.  as it turns out, the reservation wasnt necessary, as the restaurant was fairly and surprisingly empty.  we got a table outside near one of the fountains and were promptly greeted by our waiter, who kindly gave us some time to chat and look at the drink menu.  i ordered a lemongrass mojito, which was lacking in lemongrass flavor, and my buddy ordered a manhattan, which he said was good.  we ordered some shishitos at the same time as the cocktails  they came out insanely quickly.  unfortunately, they werent the best shishitos, and i actually enjoyed the little bits of brussels which were intermixed more than the peppers.for dinner, we decided to split some sushi and then each got a bowl.  we got two rolls, the shrimp tempura and one of the nightly special rolls, which had mango, avocado, and spicy tuna in it.  the mangoavocado roll was quite delicious; the tempura roll was pretty much what youd expect.in theory, my pork cheek bowl was going to be phenomenal.  in reality, it lacked on the execution.  the meat itself was tender and delicious, but everything else about the bowl was fairly bland.  overall, it lacked in the seasoning department. the sauce tasted something like a pad thai sauce, but thinned down. there was a little bit of cilantro, but not nearly enough, and the whole thing would have benefited from some additional salinity.when the time came to pay our bill, our waiter had ghosted on us.  it took about 30 minutes for him to show up after we asked for him and he did apologize for forgetting about us, as he had been serving some tables on the second floor and got caught up.overall:food: 3 starsservice: 3 starsvenue: 4 starswill i return? yes, but ill give them a little more time to work out their growing pains.  ill probably go back for happy hour.
not a bad meal, but not fantastic. dragon roll made with imitation crab meat instead of shrimp tempura, eel not crispy. flavors  presentation fine. lemongrass monitor a little sweet, but interesting. would do penn ave. fish market first
made a last minute saturday night reservation at pan and were easily able to get in. as far as decor goes, not much has been changed from the previous tamari. additionally, the music from the bar was blasting making it very hard to hear conversation, one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves. however, wait staff was friendly and very attentive. we ordered the edamame, dumplings, and dynamite shrimp to start. great to share, and the flavors were there. for entrees, a few ordered sushi which they thoroughly enjoyed. i tried the pan pho, with great flavors and not the traditional soup pho that youd expect. unfortunately, my friend ordered the hanging tender and had to send it back for refire as the steak was almost raw. in general, the food was good but it didnt blow us away. overall good, but not great. may return, but with so many new concepts coming to the pittsburgh restaurant scene, it wont be at the top of my list.
not bad but not great. lobster monkey roll was real good though. staff was friendly and service was good. food wasnt mind blowing but it got the job done. a little overpriced for the quality.
caught the last half hour of happy hour where all alcohol is half off, 57pm during the week. we ordered the 3519 cocktail and found it overly sweet. also got the thai tonic and it was refreshing with crushed cucumbers. bartender said a crowd favorite.unfortunately no food specials during hh, but we ordered the angry tuna roll and split the pork cheek bowl. pork bowl was spicy and a little underwhelming. tuna roll was delish! little bits of tempura and jalapenos on top of every roll. good balance between the rice and the tuna. service was a little spotty and unattentive at the bar, but it gave us time to relax and take our time with the meal. reminded us of tamari in the feel and cuisine options. been here twice now and always pretty empty which is a atypical of a lawrenceville place, even for a weeknight.
i miss tamari a lot, so i had to check out what pan was all about. two friends and i had dinner here at 9pm on a saturday night. wasnt crowded at all. we shared the angry snapper sushi roll and all liked it a lot. its perfect for those who can handle just a little bit of spicy, but might be slightly disappointing for those who are expecting a lot of spicy. we were almost going to order seconds, but decided to save room for our entrees. i got the braised pork belly, which my friends thought was really good. i thought it was alright; couldnt eat too much of it for some reason, probably because i wasnt a fan of the butternut squash it was served over. if it had ginger in it, the taste was too strong. if there was no ginger in it, then i have no idea what it was. i know there was cinnamon and nutmeg in it though because thats what the chef said. one of my friends got the pan pho and said the broth and meat were bad but noodles were good. the other had the drunken noodles and said they were good but too salty. when we were ready for dessert and inquired about the menu, we were disappointed to hear from our server that she didnt have anything for us. well...okay. not even an explanation of why no dessert was available? awkward end to our meal. awkward end to this review. id much prefer tamari.taste  3atmosphere  3presentation  4service  3.5overall  3
somewhat expensive, but im guessing its part of their upscaleish image. i only had the lox fried rice and some unnamed sushi samples. naming it salmon fried rice would be less pretentious since it was pretty cooked. the sushi creations were pretty imaginative and unconventional, very fusionlike with the flavors. i think i tasted barbecue sauce on top? im not sure if i liked that. plating is aesthetically pleasing.the interior is pretty and modern. if you sit at the bar you can watch the chefs at work. there are two bars i guess, the actual bar in front of the alcohol and the one in front of their kitchen. the one in front of the alcohol is the one where you can see the chefs since its from the side.
i called because of awesome yelp reviews and because i am overwhelmed and need some help getting things done. i cant say whether or not his work is good because we never got to that point. the first time i called i needed a board cut to fill an attic entrance and plexiglass or something cut to cover recessed lighting. he said he could do the job and we set up a date and time. then he text wanting pictures. i sent them. then he wanted pictures from more angles and he wanted me to measure the spaces for him. if i had time to drag the ladder around and do that i would cut the boards myself. i just cancelled the appointment and figured id reschedule later. instead i reached out to him to install a swamp cooler in a window in a garage. i wanted him to do the shopping and get whatever he needed but he preferred i do it. i am working 15 hours a day 6 days a week which is why i need help. i sent my son to home depot to get the ac unit and associated supplies. i spent most of the morning texting with the handyman and my son trying to work out the details including time changes and material needs. then i get a call that my son got a unit that doesnt really work and he would recommend we get a different style instead. back to the drawing board. i need a full service handyman who shops for and brings his own supplies after doing his own measuring so unfortunately i will have to look elsewhere for a more full service handyman.
since all the other sugar factorys closed down, this seems to be the last one left on the strip. home of the 25 lollipops as well as many other sweets, ice cream and sugar laden cocktails. we went with some ice cream and it was tasty. prices are high,the selection smaller then their other stores, pass next time.
went in around 5 on a saturday. read the other reviews so had high hopes, and it was very disappointing. the hostess said we could sit outside or at the bar, didnt even offer a normal table. we decided for the bar since we didnt want to deal with the heat. we were given menus, then fell into the black hole of crap service. sat there for about 10 minutes. i was watching my phone and they had about 30 seconds before we got up and left when the manager cam over and asked if anyone has helped us. we said no, he apologized, and offered to comp our drinks which was nice, and the only reason we stayed. so we finally got someone to come serve us, and after that the pizza came out quickly. the pizza was good, but not amazing. ive had pizza this style at about 67 other places, and they were all better. with that said, it was still good, just not great. the price was a bit high. other pizza places this style are typically 1013 a pizza while here hey were 1317. my wife got one pizza and i got one, bill came out to 34. that was with the drinks compd. once we finished our food, we waited another 10 minutes or so for the waitress to notice and bring our bill. there are just better choices. i wish we went next door to zinburger because it would have been a better meal. or libery market, joes, postinos, or one of the many other places in downtown gilbert.
first time trying this place and have the say the pizza was basic, but the pasta was outstanding.  the low raiting is based on the restaurant set up.  the place is too small and they  have too many tables side by side.  so no privacy and you can hear what everyone else is saying.  service was basic but i contribute that to being new.  another big issue was happy hour prices were only available if you sat at the bar.  i dont understand that conceipt especially since the bar was a foot from our table.
pasta was really good.  pizza was ok.  maybe i am just not a fan of the authentic style but it left me wanting more.  tasted good but not the best ive ever had.  bruschetta appetizer was good.
seeing the new places in the heritage district has been great, and my husband and i have been trying as many of them as we can, as we like to keep our money in our town.  unfortunately, these new restaurants seem a bit pricy for gilbert.my husband and i ate at pomo yesterday afternoon for an early dinner. the place was not crowded, and our server was awesome. we started with a couple of beers  peroni for me and a german pils for my husband side note: my husband is not a fan of these new funky craft beers so to have an authentic german pils on the menu was great  and the caprese salad as an appetizer.  the salad was very good, with thick tomatoes and mozzarella and basil. for our entrees, we had the lasagne and the bufala verace pizza, as we prefer the bufala mozzarella. the lasagne was very good, with lots of meat layered with the noodles. just a tad more sauce on it would have made it even better.  the pizza was also quite tasty, with just enough crunch in the crust.  after we had finished our dinner, our server offered the dessert menu. i love creme brulee and tiramisu, so i was torn between those two choices. our server, however, suggested i try the panna cotta instead, for something different. id never had it before so i cannot compare it to anywhere, but it was very good. you could see the vanilla bean in it, and it tasted really good with the accompanying blueberries, raspberries and sliced strawberries.  why i am giving them a 3star review, then? well, our total, for 3 beers, appetizer, two entrees, dessert, and tip, was 91, which we feel is too much for downtown gilbert, making pomo a place we will only visit for more special occasions. zinburger is also very good but pricey as well. hopefully gilbert will add some more affordable casual restaurants so we can partake more frequently.
pomo  apple?! yes! super short story: back in the days the tomato was introduced to the italians from the new world and was then used throughout their cooking. and since tomatoes have seeds in it, it is considered a fruit. the tomato is a fruit variation of an apple, hence pomo!  hopefully i have captured and given the word pomo its origin. if not, you are more than welcome to correct the story! :anyway, the wait was 45 minutes. started at the bar area to order some drinks. the peach bellini is a good sweet bubbly! misters and the fan were on to help cool off in the summer heat. within less than the suggested 45 minute wait we were seated to our table. all the pizza prices were roughly around 16 or so for thin crust pizzas cooked in a wood fire oven. we went for the calamari appetizer with a few surprises of fried shrimp, a couple lemon wedges to squirt some acidity over the breaded seafood. pizzas:pomo  italian sausage, roasted red bell peppers, sauteed onions and mushrooms over the pomodoro sauce and cheese. the crust was a bit on the chewy dry side. 15.95donna rosa  no tomato sauce pizza. thin crust, with pesto sauce, cherry tomatoes and shrimp. a bit on the very salty side but overall was my favorite pizza. pizza crust was more edible here. calabessas  i think thats what it was called. thin crust as well, with tomato sauce, fried eggplant and shaved parmegiano cheese which i loved. what i didnt like was the literal 4 teeny tiny pieces of eggplant about 0.34 cubic cm!!! what the heck happened here? a shortage of eggplant stock at the restaurant??? not cool. beverages: pomo lemon drop  pomo juice some pomegranate juice, vodka citrus, lemon juice. a bit strong and sour. 9peach bellini  peach juice and champagne 8 i would have to say that the intentions of the pizza menu was there but the ingredients were not.  with a little more care into the pizzas this place would be great. good ambience.
tried out pomo with some friends last night.  we had a great time and were excited to try out one of the newer restaurants in gilbert.   we had a 30 minute wait on a wednesday, so we bellied up to the outside bar while we waited for our table to be ready.  the pom lemondrop was amazing.  refreshing, well made, but a small serving for the price.  it wont stop me from ordering it again, just wish it were a larger size.  deserts were also great.  we got 4 different ones between us and they were all better than we expected.  the appetizer caprese was under seasoned well, not seasoned and came with a broken balsamic vinegar dispenser instead of a reduction already applied.  this created a mess on our table, our plates and our hands.  the waitress admitted that it was broken when we pointed it out to her, but the damage was done.  the pizzas were only okay.  my friends who shared the margherita pizza said it was bland and had no seasoning on it.  i shared the sausage and mushroom white pizza.  it had good flavor, but was light on toppings and was very oily due to the cheese and mushrooms.  the pesto is amazing, however, so make sure you order some of that to go with the bread  hat they charge 2 for.  we were also disappointed that they served canned parmesan cheese, as we all expected fresh ground since they claim to be authentic italian.the service was friendly and attentive, the atmosphere was fun, but with mediocre food im not sure if we will be rushing back.  it may end up being a good happy hour stop though.
i wanted to like this place, i really did, especially because theres so much hype around it. unfortunately, i wasnt that impressed. i had the pollo salad, which was okay, but at 14 dollars, was way overpriced for what you got a few strips of chicken with grape tomatoes and pine nuts. i feel it was quite bland. actually, that was sorta what i got from the whole experience. i also tried a piece of my friends margherita pizza. i was initially excited because the crust was delicious. it had a wonderful crisp on the outside, with a fluffy chewiness inside. unfortunately, the sauce and toppings really didnt compliment the greatness of the crust. the tomato sauce was again, quite bland. and the basil was mostly burnt, so there was little flavor associated. perhaps i will give them another shot at their phoenix location, as its closer to my house. try another one of the pizzas and hopefully they can change my mind. for now though, im content having at least tried it.
ate here for the first time, i was excited to try out a new italian place in gilbert. i think they might still be working some kinks out like most new restaurants do. the pizza was pretty good the crust was great! the house made pasta was just ok... i think for what we paid i had higher expectations. hopefully they can work on a couple things and we will return.
food is fantastic, consistency will be the death of them. and i know the setting is cool with the big garage doors but man, close me during the heat of the day and cool the joint down. its cooler outside than inside due to the musters and breeze. very uncomfortable inside. blah!
i was pretty excited to try this place and ended up on a saturday night after enjoying the happy hour next door at zinburger which has a great hh btw.  there was an hour wait but with beer in hand next door we did not sweat that at all.  the friendly hostess took my cell and i received text updates about our table which is very convenient.  once seated we realized how tight the place is. they really dont have that much seating inside and it was 113 so no bueno on the outdoor action.  the wood fired oven is bad ass but kicks a lot of heat into the place.  we watched about four groups of people try and sit at the bar facing the oven and all left within 2min due to the extreme heat.  the restaurant in general was hot.  it did not bother me too much but the people i was with were uncomfortable.  we ordered some pasta and pizza dishes and both were good but not great.  the pasta had a nice bite to it and was flavored very well.  the pizza looked awesome but i unfortunately found the crust to be spongy and soft not crispy and hard.  i had the pomo pizza and the flavor was good with a crust more like an indian nan bread than what we are used to eating.  there was a noticeable lack of salt and yeast flavor in the dough which i actually enjoyed but again, it needed to be crispy.  prices werent bad considering their ingredients and people have to get over the compare to hungry howies temptation when they look at restaurant prices.  you get good quality ingredients here and it shows.  pomo likely deserves a fourstar but sitting in 85 degree restaurant just seems like a unacceptable oversight.  they either need to jack up the capacity of their current hvac or learn to back down some of that heat the ovens are throwing in to the room with vents.
we visited pomo for the first time yesterday.  got there for an early dinner.  it was not very busy when we arrived and lots of open seating.  we were greeted right away and seated.  our server came over and took our drink order.  i noticed we were within their happy hour, but then we found out you only got happy hour prices if you sit at the bar.  we were sitting so close to the bar we could reach out and touch it, but no happy hour prices...this is silly.  it would of been nice if our greeter had mentioned this before she seated us.  i like good microbrews, but 7 is a bit high for an ipa.  we went on to looking at the menu and found a couple of pizzas that looked good.  we asked our server about doing a halfhalf and were told that they do not do that.  once again, this seemed a bit silly too.  most pizza places will do this especially if it is the same base sauce.  either way we decided to do the principe, which was very good.  fresh ingredients and definitely high quality that we definitely enjoyed.  based on the excellent food im giving it 3 starts, but i think they could use to rethink some of the other things about the restaurant.
ok, maybe i shouldnt have read yelp reviews before entering here,,, fyi, people with less than say 10 reviews, or people that only write negative reviews shouldnt be considered valid towards making decisions to try out places...came here for a friends birthday and thought awesome ,, finally get to try this place, and let me first say the staff are awesome.  really really nice staff.great selection of items for an italian joint... i was almost taken aback when i asked if they had 4 peakskilt lifter on tap,,, errr, this is italian joint, knucklehead. appetizer fritto mistovery fresh squid yummy,,, yummy, the breading was pretty good but a little soft.. but fresh squid yes, yes,,, the homemade sauce was a little off, it was good, but theres that one flavor that has you wondering if it belongs or not..  this would be a 4 star rate if this was only thing we ordered.pizza  of course we tried the pomo... now reading the mixed reviews i was trying to not judge the crust before trying, and well,,, some of you posting are crazy , as the crust was awesome , nice crunch, little chard in some areas, just seemed so fresh n delish.. now add in the fresh toppings,, woot woot, we are on a roll baby..... ^ wait,,,, whats the sauce is this ?.... strong tomato sauce, and ??? hmm not much activity for my pallet in the sauce and it has a metalicky tinge to the flavor as well..... but the crust and topping n cheese wouldve made this a 5 star joint... i might try this place one more time and get a pesto based pizza, and then the place will be rockin ?  so for me,,, 3.5 stars but not 4,   yelp please add the 12 star option any day now..
our server was super friendly, really great server but the pizza was average. too expensive for a personal pizza that was good but not great. there were large parts of the pizza that didnt have cheese on it. i love ny style pizza like grimaldis, but pomo was just ok.
i really thought their pizza was going to be amazing, and i wanted to like it, but honestly it was nothing to write home about. the margherita pizza actually tasted quite salty.. im not sure if it was the sauce or if they actually put salt on it. the staff was friendly and its a cool atmosphere, but i dont think its worth the price for their pizza. perhaps ill visit again and try a different dish.
great place. food was very good, seems similarly priced to other restaurants in the area although slightly high for pizza. mozzarella wasnt bad, tomatoes on the capresse werent too flavorful. principe pizza was outstanding. the reason for three stars? the service. they use nowait but seemed disorganized. hostess made excuses for it a couple times. we put in for a table for 3 us and baby. they asked us to take a table for two, because a party of 13 registered after us needed the 4tops. it was kinda tight and the baby kept grabbing at everything. after that, service seemed disjointed. lot of people running around ran into me a couple times. everyone is nice but everything seemed really disorganized and a little rushed.
mediocre at best.  my wife and i tried this new location on a thursday night. the place was half empty and now i know why. its mediocre at best. the menu is nice, and the wine list is ok. my guess is this is a medium grade pizza joint focused on families.  kind of like olive garden. well, if you want mediocre meals with mediocre service for a premium price, this is your place.
i love pizza and i think i was the most excited person in town when i heard pomo was coming. that being said  not a fan. the food is expensive and just meh. the drinks are realllly expensive and the atmosphere is nothing exciting. a pizza and two beers over 30? no thanks. and the pizza wasnt even that good. it wasnt bad because....is there such a thing? ive had other wood fired pizzas that were much better. i probably wont be back.
my husband, niece and i went here for an early dinner. we were seated promptly. no wait. our server was nice, helpful and friendly. the pizza really wasnt my style. the center portions are not cooked to done. i guess its the type of pizza made in the region this style originates from. i did not enjoy it. the flavors were good, but the texture of undone really threw me. that and the price for the amount of toppings. i ordered the mushroom pizza. the mushroom flavor was good, but they were sparse. overall  unimpressed.
i use to obsessively order from jimmy johns.  i love the 2 with cheese and a bag of bbq chips... it is relatively inexpensive for a full belly... i like their new location because they have a lot of extra seating and its just newer... however.  i use to have them deliver...literally...6 times a week to my apartment.  i bought a house 18 of a mile from my old apartment and they wont deliver to my house.  they will not cross torrey pines to drive to the 4th house in on my street to deliver me the same food they use to deliver 6 times a week when i lived 18 of a mile away... blows me mind... i now have eaten at this location... twice since theyve moved... it has literally left a bad taste in my mouth that they cant make an exception since i use to order from them so often for 4 houses down...so essentially... they have lost my business because i loved that i could have food delivered when i was on my way home from work instead of always having to go pick something up.
i was here last night, for the gig of the lovely joshua radin. i have been here before on one of the clubs nights. ill start with the positive stuff: its a bit out of the tourist area, and offers a variety of alternative nights to edinburghs clubbing scene. this includes the famous and crowded four corners, held once a month roughly with funk, reggae, nulatin and afro beatsyeah! , as well as other cool and fun nights. check their website for more details the stage for gigs is big enough and theres a little balcony thingy on one corner you can go on and watch or write on the chalk board they have theretheres a cafe upstairs during the day. the bar staff are hilarious. good chat!if not too crowded of course!the negatives: throughout the gig last night there seemed to be constant sound issues. the musicians had to keep requesting stuff from the sound person, and we had to wait half an hour outside before the gig because of technical issues. the drummer had to be put behind a glass thing , i guess because of the noise, but this did not improve the quality.  it got so warm! it was boiling and we werent even dancing much! air please! the decoration is in damn need of a revamp the place felt a bit shabby and out of date. whats with the glowing orange horns? the bar is small and gets a bit crazy on busy nights.the cloak room is minute. and on the other corner of the room from where you enterexit. so a bit of a struggle if you have to make your way through the crowd to get to it, then again when you want to leave. so all in all,  i love love love the nights here but the place could do with a redo!
this is a club for edgy people, as my flatmate would say. its the sort of place you go to in jeans and a top and yesterdays makeup and fit in nicely!!i live at the bottom of holyrood road, so i can hear the oonce oonce oonce till the wee hours, but its not so bad. also the only cash machine in the area is right outside my flat, so thats a bit of a nuisance! the club is quite big, its very dark so you dont notice the mess!!during the day, however, its a really nice little internet cafe serving really yummy paninis and lunch stuff! i was really surprised to learn it was a cafe too! really is a good find, and a great place to use the internet which is free if you have lunch!
bongo has a great reputation amongst us students as being quite alternative, compared to the more stereotypical clubs one may find on george street.its one of the places i plan to visit much more over the coming years, as their nights just sound so... cool! for a lack of better words. they frequently host reggae nights, a bit of a rarity in edinburgh, and even held a tribute to bob marley evening i was gutted to miss!situated quite close to pleasance, i must say the actual interior wasnt that impressive. i was there was a fundraiser, so it wasnt a typical bongo night. nevertheless, i had a great time and the band that performed was really impressive!
bongo isnt the kind of place you go to week in week out, its more of a oneoff sort of place when theres a particular gig on or one of their charity nights.the music there is much more alternative than a lot of other clubs; its about as different as the mainstream chart and dance that youd hear in any given george street club as you can get. if its dub step, reggae, electro etc youre after, then this is where you should head.the big downside of it is that its a bit of a dump. in exchange for more varied music and cheap prices, you get drinks in plastic cups, horrible toilets and sticky floors.
this place is brand new opening up a day or so ago. as stated before, they took over where qdoba was inbetween starbucks and thai basil. i killed off my chai tea and since it was about 10am and this place opens at 10, i figured id grab a bite to eat. they just got done placing all the food out and it pretty much seems like chipotle but everything else but burritos. they told me to pick what i wanted and that pricing on the board was for 3 tacos. i asked them if i could have different proteins on each taco and they stated that it was fine. i picked abobo steak, spicy korean chicken bbq and teriyaki chicken. i got about everything on all three though most people probably wouldnt. i put white rice on it, black beans, quacamole, corn, pico de gallo, and the spiciest salsa they have. it tasted fine to me. i really liked the abobo steak and korean bbq chicken. after two tacos, i was pretty full. i think the chai tea i had right before compounded. i thought it was a little expensive for what it was...coming out to little less than 12 for three fat tacos and a large drink. probably wouldve been sub10 if i didnt get the large soda. i did like the soda machine they had. one of the new ones that have single spout but have a touch screen so you can pick from like 20 different flavors. they were out of the vanilla coke i wanted. theres plenty of seating inside and out with misters outside. theres wifi from next door starbucks. parking is plenty and theres places for hipsters to park their bikes. all in all, not bad to try if youre in the mood for tacos and nearby.
good tacos!  an order comes with three big tacos and no side for 8.  i got an adobo chicken, bbq pork verde and a grilled veggie.  the pork was very good.  nice little place.
my burrito was good. some of the veggies looked like they were sitting out a while visible browning on some of the sliced zucchini in the steam tray.confusing menu, guy at the register gave me change for a 20 half in quarters and dimes :
we were happy to see popeyes show up.  weve been to others when we could, but none were close.  this one is close!so we show up, order a spicy 12 piece plus sides, and dig in.  the chicken wasnt as good as i remember, but it was pretty good.  the sides left much to be desired.  the cajun rice seemed mostly to be liver spread.  i dont remember it being like that at the other popeyes.  the fries were better...a bit of seasoning, and cooked properly.  a bit more seasoning would have been nice.  more than a bit of salt and i think it was paprika.  give them a real cajun flavor, ya know?  and i didnt see the jambalaya on the menu!!  its at other popeyes, why not this one?!anyway, it was fine but not as good as i expected.  i will try again, and next time get the rice and beans side dish instead.  and i will inquire about the jambalaya.  that was always a good accompaniment to their spicy chicken.
food and staff are good.  management could use some work.  little tip, not a great idea to have half the staff on break during 12:001:00 lunch rush.
great service, consistent with other locations. however, the chicken served here is bland compared to the my previous experiences at popeyes. is this unique here, or is this happening at all of them?
we were greeted with a warm welcome back. i guess they thought they remembered me..... i know thats how they great everyone but i figured they recognized me from the tele. chicken was decentmost of my 12 regular  12 spicy order was moist. skin was crispy. spicy wasnt too spicy. they have sweet tea plus the new coke dispensers so you have a million drink options. they are definitely sauce nazis though, you only get 2 per large meal  1 for little meals. i tried a couple of their new ranch dipping sauces and wasnt too impressed. its fast food chicken so i cant see getting to excited but if your craving, youve got to fill the void.
dad, everybody at school is wearing these shoes, we need to go to tillys!we went, we saw, we did not conquer...the nike sb stefan janoskis, as the selection of shoe sizes were limited. tillys is a nice clean store with a friendly and helpful staff and plenty of trendy clothing, shoes and accessories for teens and hipsters. i have spent several hundred dollars patronizing this place over the years and will not let this recent visit stop us from coming back :see 5 photos below...yelp 300 challenge 2015: 283
tl;dr good sushi close to campus, but price !sushi168 is a sushi chain with a new location in waterloo. its primarily an ayce sushi restaurant, but is an upscale variation with a variety of korean, thai, vietnamese, cantonese dim sum, etc. foods with a large karaoke lounge and a bar also onsite.service:as they had just opened, i found that service was quite good for an ayce sushi place. there were lots of staff on hand, including many that just stood around watching all the tables. the salad bar buffet was kept very clean and orderly the entire time we were there. they were very fast at removing empty plates and refilling drinks, and i noticed that there was constantly workers replenishing the salad bar area. youre given a brief tour of the restaurant if its your first time.i do wish theyd tell us what the roll was as they place it on the table, like they do at kinkaku. unfortunately, our table did receive things that we did not order eg. a california roll!, and a waitress said theyd replace our soy sauce but never actually did so. i get the impression that there are different levels of wait staff depending on ability, since telling one waitress that we didnt order the california roll prompted deerinheadlights look and one of the waitresses standing around moved in quickly to resolve it.the presentation of the maki was simple and good unlike other cheaper places where the ends are rough and rushed; the ratio of fishfilling to rice was good for most maki eg. salmon roll, salmonavocado roll, however the special maki had too much cucumber in it. the taste of the sushi maki was average. this is one of the few places where ive had a crabmeat cheese wonton be consistently hot throughout, compared to most places that microwave them. the grilled salmon belly wasnt that great, most likely because of the cut of the fish wasnt that good, and the kalbi beef was neither juicy nor tender.they have a selection of desserts that havent been seen before. a shaved ice machine, as well as syrups eg. mango, lychee, kiwi, condensed milk, chocolate, bubble tea toppings fruit balls, tapioca, jelly were a great way to end the meal. they also have different mousse cakes and mango yoghurtpudding. i recommend the shaved ice with lots of condensed milk!... but watch out because the warm bowls and syrup will melt the shaved ice quickly!the price is high, at 15.95 for a weekday buffet lunch. there is a 5 cash discount. only accepted are cash and credit, no debit.
we went there for the lunch buffet and we were pretty impressed.pros: the service was prompt and efficient. we were given a small tour of the restaurant, and detailed instructions of how to use the ipad system was provided as well. our waitress was very attentive and helpful.in terms of food, the salad bar and shaved ice machine are delightful surprises. im happy to see theres a few dim sum selections. the thai selections seemed interesting as well but i didnt get to try much.cons: the rolls and sushis were not good. first, the proportion of rice vs other ingredients were not right. a good nigiri should have a piece of fish that drape over the piece of rice, but the piece of rice they had was large so the fish only covered the top of it. also, the rice was not properly cooked. they probably put too much water in it so the texture was not right at all.overall, i would recommend this place for the nice environment and good selections of various kinds of asian food, but not for their sushi.
impressive soft opening. didnt go for the all you can eat, and decided to test the quality straight up by getting the sashimi sampler. did not disappoint.great value at 19.95 for 26 pieces including 4 slices of super buttery tender hamachi. the fish was very fresh, and the knife work was quite delicate. the only exception was the ahi tuna, which was a little dry and sinewy for some reason. service was attentive, and the waitresses seemed really concerned that i wouldnt be satisfied with just the sashimi boat and really tried to convince me to go for the ayce!!really clean trendy place, with lots of room for bigger groups.keep up the freshness, and i just might show up a couple times more!
i am going to give this new opened sushi restaurant a solid 3 stars! decor is pretty nice, and the thought of diy shaved ice crean is good. i enjoyed my meal here.
actually really like it here. it has some of the same stuff i enjoy but also new things that i really enjoy. very nice place to eat .however the staff hovers and that others me . i hate people basically standing there watching me eat . it bothers myself and my friends .
we were invited out for dinner tonight by fans of this restaurant.  nice decor, fast friendly efficient service.  forgot to check out the washrooms, lol.  tried the mongolian soup, which was interesting and different, although i suspect it might be clam chowder spiced up. the salad bar is okay, there is a crab salad as well as shrimp and mussels.  the dessert table is alright, several small cake choices and puddings, plus ice cream, and the little dishes of tiramisu were delicious. no, i did not find any fresh fruit which i missed.  i cant really complain about the food as our hosts are japanese and did 95 of the ordering which translates to lots and lots of salmon of all kinds i hate salmon and other assorted  raw fish, which i really do not enjoy, but ate anyway to be polite.  he also ordered some dim sum dishes, the har gow and sui mei, which were okay, and tempura vegetables, which were bland.  i added an order of thai crispy chicken later on, i really was craving something hot and cooked at that point which turned out to be delicious, i wish there had been more, but everyone liked it, and poof, it was gone lol, and by then i was full from having to eat all that raw fish.  i also requested the takoyaki balls which were not as good as the ones at kinkaku izakaya, and the cheese wontons, which were  very nice.  unfortunately one of our favorite things, spicy crab sushi or pizza, is absent from the menu completely.  i saw our favorite dynamite roll on the tablet, but our host got the salmon roll instead. yup, more salmon, sigh.  anyway, i find it a little too pricey to be honest. im a senior and on a weekday the charge for me im a light eater too was 22.95.  for a couple dollars more for a regular adult, you can enjoy kinkaku, and sushi 99 is less expensive as well.  everyone wanted coffee at the end of the meal and we all said no when the waitress informed us that it was an extra 2.95 per cup!!  sorry  2.95 for a normal cup of coffee  ridiculous.  we likely wont be returning even though the thai crispy chicken was good, there isnt enough here to draw us back when there are other alternatives.
from the four times i have gone here, i think the last experience was the only poor experience i had. they were pretty busy so our food was very slow to come, and even then they gave us the wrong food. but the other three times have been great! i would recommend it but steer clear on a weekend.
was pretty excited this place opened locally. i had their half rack of babby backs, wife had the pulled pork sandwich. kind of pricey, twelve dollars for the ribs. at that price they better be great, however they werent. ribs were dry, not much flavoring, and you have to tear them off the bones. sandwich was decent, need to use a better bun. coleslaw was excellent. i would like to come back again to try something else.
id love to write a review of your food, but youre never open!  are you trying to go out of business early? closing with the excuse that youre sold out right during dinner time is totally lame!  we live close and keep trying to eat the food but keep running into the closed sign  at dinner time!  at dinner time!  the owners are not taking business seriously at all.  it is a 1 star for service and an undecided for the food.  start acting like a real business with real hours so we can review your food!
the first time we came in they had ran out of some menu items so we didnt order and left. the second time they were out of things again specifically the ribs and cheesy potatoes. the menu selection is small as it is so its not good when they are always running out. the pulled pork was good but not served hot. they recently opened so maybe they are just figuring things out. the staff was very nice. the place was clean but hot inside there. i will give them another chance before i say i wont go back.
very very nice people, extremely generous to the community.  i wish i could rave more about it because the owners are super friendly 5 stars all the way but the bbq itself is just adequate; 3 star at best. the coleslaw was crispy and fresh which i love, but  the dressing was flavorless. the cheesy potatoes are unique and a great touch but flavorless. everything felt like it needed more salt as a chef, you can tell when not enough salt has been added and just more pizzaz. the ribs were dry. the pulled pork was moist and lean but just meh with store bought frys hamburger buns i can do at home.  the real sticking point for me was that they have no poultry;  only beef and pork are offered here. the menu is super limited. i really want to give them better than 3 stars and while they are really super nice people, im not eating peopleim eating bbq. and this bbq is just 3 stars.
finding good bbq in arizona is difficult, so when gq opened i had high hopes. walking in i found a very sparse place with picnic tables. so far so good. some of the best bbq i have ever had has been in dumps with mismatched furniture. the service is very friendly, and the food comes out fast. i had the pulled pork and beans. both were good, but a little bit on the expensive side.i was on the fence about giving 3 or 4 stars. this place could be a solid 4 star with a few changes: no sauce control! when it comes to bbq, the sauce is everything. i have flown a thousand miles with a jug of sauce as carry on pre tsa. and the best bbq places always have the sauce on the tables. but here, you must pay homage to the sauce master who hoards the sauce behind the counter, and applies it for you.spicy sauce! this is arizona, and a spicy sauce should be available. fries! most of the top bbq places offer fries. and if gq wants to flirt with a 5 star, dont walk over to frys and buy a frozen bag of french fries. cut and fry your own.
super nice couple that owns this place.  food was pretty good but missed some much needed salt.  i felt the potatoes where bland and needed salt and would have been nice to smoke it to add more flavor.  the bbq was good minus the seasoning.  not too smoky.  i asked why such a limited menu and he said he just didnt have any more room in his smokers.  hard to expand with only 3 which is understandable i guess.  just was hoping for more food wise.  the home run for me was the thinner sauce which had nice tang.
played some keno here last night.machines are tight.bartender was pleasant enough.didnt ask us to sign up for anything.no big deal.they did  a real nice job on the remodel.we might come back to try the food.
tried this spot at a recent car meet that was on my side of town the truck can frequently be found outside of a popular strip club, but i couldnt justify the trip across town just for a dog. truck staff were cool and friendly didnt mind boxing up my order to go, were helpful with menu suggestions. save for the lobsteronastick thing, prices are average: 69 for a dog with tons of toppings.nacho dog: ive been drooling over this since i saw it on instagram but found it a little disappointing. the frank seemed light it might have been sitting out for a bit, and there was a ton of guac. usually this is a good thing and a good value! but the guac itself didnt have much flavor and overpowered the other toppings. i was going for a bit more crunch and cheese than i actually got in this version. i liked it, i just didnt love it. street tacos: i have no idea what possessed my bf to order tacos at a hotdog truck, but these looked better than they tasted. meat was dry and tortillas were a little odd quite thick, flavors were okay. i wouldnt get this again, but i guess its good to offer something aside from the obvious for hotdog haters?seasoned fries: another bf pick. fresh, could have used more seasoning because it was tasty, but at the end of the day, theyre fries.overall, solid experience. the truck music and outgoing guy taking orders made the experience a bit better than your average transaction. but the ownermanagers? unprofessional responses to other honest and valid reviews are what made me round my rating down rather than up.
the new location opened up 2 weeks ago and they still have a lot of issues to work through.  the microphones werent working to notify people that they are ready to seat you, the wait times were way off as they told us 30 min and it took nearly 50 min.  the server who was employed with them for over 10 years was over worked.  she wasnt attentive, never came back to our table once we were served until finally we flagged her down for more water and tortillas.   although after asking she never showed up with the request.  finally she came back to drop the check and we asked her for the tortillas again and she slammed her hand on the table and took off.  she came back but dropped to go boxes at the same time as the check but we were not done eating.  we provided some constructive criticism to the manager who apologized and took 50 off our bill.  the food was excellent as always but the service struggled.  the new location is smaller than the old location as they have less tables.  the manager stated that the computers have glitches and the bussers are all new but the kitchen and servers followed them.  the atmosphere is loud as there is no fabric or carpet throughout its all wood and echoes.  so if you want a quiet dinner or want to hear the people at your table forget it.  they were very crowded and obviously were not ready.
really nothing special about their food. best way to describe the food is ordinary. there were 6 of us and each commented that the food was just ok. place is huge and the atmosphere is pleasant. service was fine. worth trying for you mexican food fans. perhaps you will find something to enjoy.
i love carlos obriens.  weve been going here since the 16th st.  bethany home location!  when the location closed at bell and scottsdale, we were bummed.  then we heard about the new location at mayo and 101.  woo hoo!however, the aesthetics in this location are horrible.  we were seated on the stage and it was so loud that we could barely hear each other across the table.  it seemed they were short staffed as the tables took a while to get cleaned and getting more chips was a chore.  hopefully they will work out the kinks.
ive had the opportunity to dine at this location twice now.  service has been quick, place is clean and its a fairly comfortable mexican restaurant.  so on the topic of mexican... i get the carlos, yet the obriens.... not so much .  the top 2 recommend dishes on both visits were the pollo fundido and the 13 a little bit of everything in miniature!sadly, i have had both and they were both just borderline ok for me.  not much flavor though decent serving sizes.  i do not understand why its so hard to find good, especially authentic tasting mexican food in arizona?  sorry c.o. just not a winner for me.  best to you and the customers that are fans.id strongly suggest to spice things up.
not as good as the other panthere verte...
the two best things about this place were the view see the picture i posted and the customer service. my honey and i rarely venture to the strip especially to eat, bit we happened to be in the area and decided to give it a try. the ambience is nice with big open windows that give great ventilation. the actual restaurant was really clean as well!!lets start with their confusing check in offer, which is more like a false advertisement. it claims to offer a free 16oz. beer with your check in, but its really a free 16oz. beer with the purchase of a gigantic steak and a check in. lame. as expected, the beer prices were the standard high. the food was pretty basic bar food. in my opinion the appetizers were more appealing than the entrees. we ended up ordering several different apps. the loco moco could use more spam, i didnt really taste it. theartichoke hearts were yummy; i especially enjoyed the lemoney sauce. we also tried the breakfast flatbread which unfortunately wasnt as sun shiny as it was described. the flatbread didnt evoke breakfast at all. it was more of a meat lovers pizza.
stopped in to try the place out.  check in offer is a bit weak.  buy a 32 steak and get a free soft pretzel?  pass.check in process was a bit confusing  multiple entrances, but confusing where to go to be seated.  seemed to be a common issue for many i watched walk in.had a traditional moscow mule which was good.  they offer several varieties adding various flavors for those who are more adventurous.pulled pork flatbread was just ok.  not much pulled pork and a lot of sweet maybe a bit too sweet bbq sauce.  calamari was also just ok  nothing exceptional.
the taproom is pretty cramped and not really laid out that well. it was hard to squeeze into the bar to order. i only tried 2 of their beers before i left, and they werent that great. they didnt have a lot of flavor. we avoided the crowd inside and sat in their back garage area at the picnic tables. there was a corn hole game setup which is always a plus :
beer is great, but there are way to many children running around for a brewery. i dont get it. they have story time going on where the corn hole is. leaving us unable to play. a lady asked the bartender to turn off music for it. wtf!!! weird and not cool at all.
soo, the decor is really cute. beer is pretty good.. lighting was awkward and the ambiance didnt have me very excited. felt like a tea party instead of a brewery.. like having a beer in your grandmas kitchen. oh, and no smoking ecigs or cigarettes anywhere on premises. yawn
the beer was good and the location cannot be beat. what i did love is how nice the bartender was. she asked what we liked and then helped us select some beers to our liking. liked the seating and the big room in the back.  will be back
it was ok.  pricing wasnt too bad. i got the beef stroganoff and it was alright, but a little greasywatery? i prefer nothing but noodles honestly. the service was good.
new clever minimal design concept yuppie coffee house on the edge of mjt. i ordered a cappuccino and it was divinely creamy at the start but a very light roast. at 4 id declare it on the higher price end of the spectrum for a coffee that will be interesting to see if people will support. if you walk under 10 minutes you can get one for 2.50 on dante  san simeon. i prefer a darker stronger roast but what the hell do i know about coffee my name isnt fellow yelper khai our local yelp java aficionado expert. pay more attention to his review than mine as he speaks the gospel. you can tell from the design of this place that they did their homework and invested thought, time and money to create a higher quality experience from a local roaster.  perusing the shop i did notice some chemex boston based company and aeropress units to make coffee at home recently i bought an aeropress in alberta and its freaking amazing for 3539 depending on where you buy it. 10x better than a french press folks. buy one if you think a french press is the kittys scratch post! ill come by and give this funksterhipster place another chance. if you like independant shops its a much better option than timmy hohos or that green mermaid from seattle. check it out.
took my youngest9 and my mom for a movie. the line to pay and get our tickets took forever!! and we were second in line. we got there early so we could check out their pizza. after ordering two of the pepperoni pizzas, one was charred black and the crust was hard. the pizza had very little taste. nothing special... now the theater i would give five stars!!!the seats alone are awesome!! having the ability to put your feet up and lean back in comfortable leather seats is worth the bad pizza...next time, i want to bring my blanket and pillow..... lol
theater is awesome but arcade is way too expensive and the prize booth is not great.  the rest of the facility is ok.   would probably rate the place a 2 but the theater is a 4 or 5.  sad that you cannot buy tickets for the movies online and they do not stay current on the movie times on the website outdated.  they also do not answer the phone when you try to call even during business hours and the voicemail is full.   not a well managed facility.
i tested this place out bc my son will be having his birthday party there. i am glad to see that the movie experience is awesome because i was not blown away by the games and the golf is hard but the pirate theme is cool. the card for the games needed to be swiped at least 3 times for every game to a really start working and it gets . 10 doesnt get you far at all and the prizes have really high point redemption values. flipside way surpasses in this area. when i spoke to an employee about the card and the games i didnt get much of a response except yeah we know.... the place does look way more dated than its recent opening should portray. i am still looking forward to the movie here but otherwise i will stick to flipside.
loved the theater, waited way to long only one person at the register and he had to multitask, watched two employees looked like management sitting at a nearby table who never got up to help. the very worst part; i ordered the panini and 30 minutes into the movie i got violently ill. i couldnt wait to get home to the comfort of my own space. i will definitely go back to the theater but i will not be ordering any food.
i have been here twice with my children. always fun and food is pretty good at pizinis.
this was my first time here. me and a friend tried out the movie theater and the seats are amazing but as for it being our first time it was a little bit of a let down. staff was different then most family places they were just there. not rude but not very helpful either. maybe it was because it is new and not opened for long. eventhough lines to get movie tickets and concessions only had one person ahead of us it still took a long time to get tickets and order. also we did not realize we could get food delivered to our seats. would of been a fun thing to add but we figured it out on our own after we saw the movie. just a simple have you been with use before might of been a nice question to ask. if we said no a little info might of helped sell more of your items! ill be back to try out the bowling and take friends to have a nice seat at the theater but over all i just wish harkins had those chairs!
the place is fun as long as their computers dont go down before hand or during your visit. we waited in line to be told they couldnt sell us anything or let us use any of the attractions. i kindly asked if we could play a round of mini golf while they fixed their issue and pay when finished and was told no. finally got the bowling alley up and running and purchased a lane but there was no music and the tvs at the end of the lanes were touch and go. heard all of the movies that were showing shut down during their computer issues which made the whole place worthless.i imagine if things were working it would be a great place for the the family but they need to get a better back up plan in place if they continue with the computer issues.
wanted to check this place out since we usually bowl at amf. its a fun place for kids but if youre interested in bowling bowling i dont think this place is for ya. theres no ceiling fans as you know when you start bowling it gets pretty hot! it was hard to readunderstand the score board, you couldnt tell who was suppose to bowl next. they did a lot of games on the side to get free tshirts or game cards. they do have cosmic bowling which was fun however their music kept cutting out. its all couch seating so thats pretty nice, but the tables they had were too high and big for the area. the arcade area is small with mainly ticket machines. the bar area was pretty plain. wasnt much of a drink selection. we decided to try some snacks, they recommended the jalapeno poppers and fried zucchini. the jalapeno poppers were good but missing the bronco berry sauce from arbys that would of made it lol. the fried zucchini had too much breading. overall we will try this place again but i think we will stick with amfs for our regular bowling.
such a fun place, but i seriously leave every movie with my clothes stuck to me because its so hot in the theaters!!!!
the theater itself is nice and has really comfortable recliners. the food is blah. we ordered a margarita pizza to share it was bad and had no flavor. it tasted like i was eating plain crust. i will return to see a movie but i wont bother with the food its not worth it.
attended a company holiday party here.  it was so warm inside it was almost unbearable.  food was provided and was pretty tasty.  the staff was friendly and responsive to our large parties needs.  we ordered tap beer and it could have been colder but it was good.  very clean, will definitely bring the family back for some fun.we did find that the bowling lanes were very sticky.  staff exchanged our shoes and polished our lane but it made for our bowling experience mediocre.  however the staff was very attentive, just unable to rectify the situation.
food is 3.75 stars, check in people 5 stars, our waitress 2 stars. we felt good going into this restaurant and excited for their breakfast options. wait was about 45 min saturday morning which seems about right for a new restaurant in downtown gilbert. the hostess party was very enthusiastic and delightful to deal with. once we were seated the experience started to slip, our waitress was very obviously tired of working all morning and it not only showed on her face but in her attitude as well. she was short with her answers and seemed to get annoyed at any questions. her attitude leaked into my dining experience and i was unable to enjoy my meal. next time we come back we will try to sit in a different area.
this place is very popular. i have to admit i dont get it. it isnt bad, it just wasnt that good. i had the lox plate. the salmon was nice as was the bread, a dark pumpernickel type. the sides of capers, onion and tomato were made into a sweetish relish which did not go well with the lox. the greens were fesh, a large undressed mound and the egg was a halved boiled egg not chopped.  one companion had an omelet which seemed to be the best choice. another had the quinoa porredge, not a huge hit. the service was fast, friendly and informed.
very trendy and cute outside with games and nice outdoor seating. the service was great but food fell short... good but not anything to rave about. we had nutella french toast situation  i dont think there was much actual nutella. there was some other chocolate conception over it which was not as good as nutella would have been .... also tried the breakfast burrito good flavor, kinda soggy. nothing amazing. overall trendy cute place with decent food.
just came back from a late breakfast, on a wednesday. this was our first time here. i really have mixed feelings about this place. the pros: its new, good lighting, great employees, and food, is good, my son said it was great, my wife loved hers, but im the one who is giving the review. im 51 and maybe i like things just a little more laid back, not so loud, just relaxing. i could not relax one minute here. this is another place that feels your meal just wont be great unless the music is real loud. hey, i like to crank up the tunes like anyone else, but i like to relax while im eating. the noise from just the customers was higher then most places, so add in the loud music, and im not feeling it. my wife had the caprese benny, wbacon, extra cost for bacon  caprese benedictsummerripe heirloom tomatoes tossed with pesto and served over fresh mozzerella on toasty ciabatta with poached eggs, cream cheese hollandaise and a touch of balsamic reduction. 12.25.my son had the chili verde benny slow cooked pulled pork over a stack of green chile sauced tortillas and melted cheese with poached cage free eggs and green chili hollandaise, pico de gallo and cotija cheese.  he destroyed it!! he loved it. 11.50 i had the snooze spuds deluxea heaping portion of  hash browns, covered with melted cheddar  jack cheese, scallions plus choice of two fillingssooo good with an egg or two you pay extra for eggs, really! 12.00 it was not bad, pork was very good, not enough of it, ham is ham, plenty of that of course. lots of cheese on a mound of hash browns. even with the two eggs i added, still, very dry. in the end, its to much potatoes. there is no breakfast that comes with pancakes, eggs, baconsausage. you can substitute  or add but always an added cost. iced tea , 2.00 each. so my bill before tip, 42.85, a bit on the high side.so, i have mixed feelings. my wife loved hers, and my son as well.... yes , we will be coming back. i will try something else. our server, liz was great! she made some recommendations, that my wife took, and loved. iced tea always filled, other staff very help full. i know what your thinking, you think i really love this place, and i am very close to loving it. iim old school, like my breakfast in a relaxing place. i will try them again, and if it warrants it i will raise the rating.  downtown gilbert is now the place to be, so expect crowds, and expect to have to park and walk a little bit, but walking is good for us all! weekends can be crazy here or any other eatery in this area. my wife and son give them a big woo hoo, but i have to give them a woo doh!.  have a great visit, eat well!
if you like salmon try the benny goodman. it is awesome. i know this place is ecofriendly but this is arizona  get a misting system on your patio or you are going to be sued for people and dogs dying waiting on their food.  the shade on the patio area is extreme inadequate,
first time here. friendly staff and cool, retro decor think jetsons and an interesting menu with some unique takes on breakfast and lunch standards.our initial overall reaction was very positive, but almost immediately after sitting down it became apparent the restaurant is extremely noisy yes im yelling with all caps because in snooze its the only way to be heard. why do restaurant designers decide to go all hard surface. we had to raise our voices, as did our server, just to ask questions and place our order. really uncomfortable and virtually impossible to carry on a normal, relaxed conversation. fyi, it was midweek late morning, so id hate to hear what its like when really busy. giving them the benefit of the doubt, perhaps where we sat was the focal point and other locations in the restaurant will be a bit quieter. if youre bothered by high sound levels, be sure to come when snooze isnt busy andor ask for the quietest spot in the restaurant.on the positive side, our server was excellent. very friendly and helpful, taking her time explaining many of the dishes to us newbies and giving us some helpful suggestions. the food was very tasty. i enjoyed the huevos rancheros and my wife had an eggs benny duo of chile verde benny and chilaquiles benedict.everything was hot and flavorful with a new twist on old standards,. while less food for the money and perhaps not as fulfilling as some of our other favorite places,  well definitely come back whenever we want something unique and different for breakfast as there are some fantastic sounding items on their menu we want to try. we were also impressed enough that well try them for lunch. the only thing keeping us from making this a frequent place will be the extreme noise level. perhaps when the weather cools off well ask for the patio, but then wed miss out on all the neat retro decor. ahhh... life is just full of sacrifices.
your food is just as scrumptious here as at any of your other locations. i get that youre new and working out a few of the kinks. let me help you... dude at the welcome station wrote down my phone number for texting incorrectly  twice. so we waited an extra 15 minutes until someone else was smart enough to call out our name. your servers are quite inattentive. id like my water refreshed, id like my coffee refreshed, id like someone to ask how im doing. snap it up folks  good food calls me back, but inferior service sends me down the street.
waited an hour yesterday for a good breakfast...not great by any standard and certainly not worth the wait.  we agreed that if we go back and if theres a wait more than 10 minutes, well walk down to liberty market or farmhouse for a better dining experience.my wife had the corned beef hash and i had the reuben sandwich, both of which were ok but nothing special at all.  the staff was extremely friendly and the atmosphere inside is loud, so be prepared for really good service, pretty good food and lots of noise.
service was subpar. food presentation was good, but taste wasnt as good as presentation.  i had the bella bella benny and all i could taste was hollandaise sauce. they also need to invest in some misters outside.
came in and was seated right away. waitress brought us water and it took her another 15 minutes to come back and take our order. once our order was placed it took 3040 minutes for our food to show up. sitting now for about an hour and no food. once the food arrived it was really good!i had to stop another waitress to fill up my empty water glass. finally after being here for an hour and a half ,if not more, i flagged our waitress down with my credit card. our service and wait time really sucked!!! but the food was so good we will have to come back and give it another shot. annnnd now i am 40 minutes late to a meeting. awesome
breakfast was good but dont go if you have plans shortly after. we got there around 8am and we waited 45 minutes  an hour for a table although we were told 2030 minutes. once we sat down our server was great and the food came out quick.
the staff was helpful, attentive, and friendly. the delicious food and drinks made up for the noise level. we could barely talk to each other across the table. not the place for a meeting unless you sit outside.
decent food, but way overpriced. 3 eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast with a coffee was almost 14. the food was tasty but nothing special. atmosphere was nice and waitress were friendly.
tried the gilbert location of snooze this morning. hostess passed us over for seating so our wait was super long. why are all the new restaurants built without any sound absorbing material? it was so noisy inside the server couldnt even hear my order. i like that they have items on their menu that other restaurants dont, like corned beef hash and blueberry pancakes with lemon custard. friendly and attentive server and meal overall was good. if i eat there again ill sit on the patio...just too noisy inside. who wants to have to yell to have a conversation? coffee not very good either.
seems like a nice place.  kind of noisy.  my eggs and toast were cold but hashbrowns were good. my husband had the sandwich i am....very good
i ate at snooze for the first time on sunday, and enjoyed the experience. i love all of the little restaurants in the downtown gilbert area, and snooze is a great addition. the atmosphere is great, and the service is good! we went early so we were seated right away, but as we were leaving there seemed to be a little wait. the reason i am giving 3 stars is because the breakfast burrito i ordered was very spicy, so much so that i did not eat much of it. the server really wanted to take it back and give  me something else, but i really do not like to do that or waste food, so i brought the rest home. there should be a warning in the menu about how spicy it is! our server said a lot of people have been saying that recently, so hopefully they do! i plan to come back and try it again because my mom loved her pancakes, and i really want to try one of the morning cocktails!
was disappointed.  the wait is long..not enough room inside for people waiting so the stand around and too close to those who are already eating at tables. the food is just ok. my eggs were slightly runny and the hash brown potatoes were not  very good  the bacon is excellent.  will not be returning to this eatery.
visited for the first time last sunday.  i had high expectations based on a neighbors referral.  my first impression was highly favorable.  after studying the menu i realized that the prices were a little higher than other local breakfastoriented restaurants.  on top of that, breakfast meat was not included in most of the menu items, you can add it for an additional charge.  so even more pricey than local competitors.  my wife ordered a french toast item with nutella.  she thoroughly enjoyed it.  i ordered the breakfast burrito.  based on another review i ordered the hash browns on the side.  the hash browns were lukewarm.  the burrito was less than lukewarm.  it was supposed to have black beans, eggs, cheese with a green sauce topping.  it was probably 95 black beans so the taste was very bland.  thank goodness it was smothered with green sauce.  it is back to the farmhouse restaurant on sunday mornings for us.
first impression: girl who greeted and sat us looked like she just rolled out of bed and hadnt brushed her hair for a few days. floor under our table was dirty. some food was good; some was just ok. enjoyed the blt type sandwich but hash browns were lacking.
the food was the greatest part of this place and possibly the only thing that would bring us back. for me anything local, farm grown or organic is a plus and this wide menu offered that. it tasted delicious. my boyfriend had three eggs with sausage larger than expected and i had two benedict one regular, one caprese. both were delectable. if you like hash browns you would love theirs, crunchy and fresh, no need for ketchup. he ordered a screwdriver which he found was bland and i had the coffee cosmo which was tasty. the atmosphere was retro with 70s music, although well done there was a lack of sound barrier. there were no misters outside so eating out there wasnt an option, and waiting was a bit sweaty due to their small wait area. the bar was small with limited seating. we ended up sitting inside on the back section. we were surrounded by several kids and the room was quite loud between conversations, kids yelling and the music. dimmed our experience. finally our waitress, this place closes at two so i imagine she was tired when we came in at 1230. she was pleasantly concerned about our drinks but disappeared after ordering and we didnt see her till she dropped the check off after someone had come to grab our plates. the other staff seemed pleasant, quick to clean tables, efficient and they use a service that texts you for your table which is convenient. next time we will probably do take out.
if the wait is going to be an hour... they should tell you it is going to be an hour! my girlfriend and i got together saturday morning and decided to try snooze for the first time since we had both previously gone with our husbands but declined to wait on the very long line.  we went early in hopes of avoiding a long wait.  when we arrived, it was busy, but not crazy.  there were several open tables and we thought the line would move quickly.  when we put our name on the list we were advised it would be a 2535 minute wait.  ok, not too bad. we opted for first available seating as it was still early and cool enough outside. after about 50 minutes, i approached the hostess to check on our time.  she acknowledged that we were past our stated wait time and said oh, im sorry, that was my fault, but there are still 4 people ahead of you.  about 15 minutes later we were told they had a table available but it was outside.  well, now that over an hour had gone by, it had heated up nicely and we no longer wanted to sit outside.  they told us they would seat us at the next available indoor table.  we watched 2 other groups get seated inside before they remembered about us. sighonce seated it took several minutes for anyone to show up for our drink orders or to go over the menu and specials.  on a highnote  i love that the food is farm freshorganic. i opted to try the sweet potato pancake with my eggs and it was unlike any other pancake i have ever had.  absolutely delicious!!  my friend had that days special, which was a lemon curdmarscapone cream, white chocolate chip pancake concoction, that she also thoroughly enjoyed.if the service was as good as the food, i would have given 5 stars.  unfortunately, the long wait and slow service definitely put a damper on our snooze experience and our morning. ;
i wanted to really like this place and i just cant give it more than 3. the food was good. the benny goodman was awesome. french toast was alright. the wait time and service is what killed the experience. i told the seating hostess it was my husbands birthday and asked if they do anything for birthdays. she said yes of course and made a note. our server didnt even acknowledge it was his birthday and he didnt get anything special . next time well go to black bear. bigger portions, less expensive, and much more laid back.
psa:  pinapple upside pancakes sound good in theory only.  after waiting 15 minutes to be seated,  another 15 to get coffee, and another 20 to get food this is my review.1.  waiting that long for breakfast on a thursday...really?  im disappointed in myself for this one.  2.  pancakes smothered in white sugary glaze, cinnamon butter, and pinapple pieces is just ew.3.  coffee was ok.4.  ordered a scrambled egg on the side.  it was cold and rubbery. 5.  ill stick to plain butter and maple syrup next time.if it aint broke dont fix it.
great improvement from our last visit here. we were arrayed promptly and served just as quick. i had juans breakfast tacos and they were very good.
i had the simple pancakes with sausage pattie. they are ok. there are better places around here for pancakes. but if i do come back. the sausage pretzel burger looked really good.
good service and fast seating due to the fact we arrived at 2pm before closing. my boyfriend and i are gilbert locals and have been anxious to go check out snooze but its always been busy.. like a 45 min wait so we usually go to over easy instead. loved the brewmosas and pumpkin pancakes!!! we both also ordered the breakfast burrito.. not so great. it was a huge burrito but didnt have much flavor. it was drenched in some kind of sauce to give to flavor. i would give this restaurant another try because the pancakes were fantastic ! but not worth the long wait in the before noon hours. 3.5 starts!
well, i was super excited to try their breakfast, but it was an extremely long wait. people who arrived after us got a table before us. we ended up leaving. you cant really snooze when youre coming to this place.
ok here is the deal, this place has amazingly delicious food, however the two hour wait for lunch is ridiculous!  i dont know if i got there on an off day but waiting that long for eggs and bacon is unacceptable.
i was intrigued by the long lines and wanted to see what was up with the snooze hype. i put my name down at 12pm on a saturday and was told that there would be a 1.2 hour wait. we decided to go to postino where there was no wait and delicious food. but i was still so curious about the popularity of snooze. i kept myself on the waitlist and as we were closing out our check at postino, i got a text from snooze.we decided that we were going to brunch hop and made our way over to snooze. it was still heavily packed, but we got a really nice table outside next to the lawn games: corn hole, ping pong and mini golf. we were interested in the pancake flight and ordered the sweet potato pancake, the omg french toast and the blueberry pancake. similar to the wait for getting a seat at snooze, they definitely make you wait for your food. it took almost an hour since we placed our order for the food to arrive. then we realized we didnt have silverware and we waited another 15 minutes for that. i understand that being busy means great business, but still! i think i ended up eating some of the pancakes with my fingers so it wouldnt get cold, cave person style. the pancake flight was decent, but after waiting so long, i am now hesitant to return. the only really cool addition was balloons by tim who comes around to businesses to make balloon sculptures for kids of all ages. my sister loves toad from mario brothers and he made one for me to give her. :
while this little bouchon outpost has decent espressos and very nice service, i have been disappointed in the famous keller macarons each of the three or four times ive had them. macarons are my favorite treat and these have simply been stale every time. they are hard, not crisp and light. i cant eat the other bready things because im gluten intolerant, so i cant speak for those items. i would come back for the espresso though, certainly.
this new location the 2nd outpost in the venetian is located facing the strip, in a walkway between the venetian and palazzo.  its new, its small and it has the same goods as the one under the escalator. if you need a bouchon bakery fix, it has the main favorites... tko, butter nutter, oh ohs, large macarons, bouchons, but doesnt have a lot of the items the main yountville bakery has that place is 5 stars!.  no scones, only a few pastries, no lemon tarts, no bread pudding, no raspberry danish, etc.  it probably has about 50 of selection of the one in napa valley. in that sense it was a little disappointing when i asked if they had the bacon cheddar scone that i was craving and was met with the puzzled look of, whats a bacon cheddar scone? well, yountville has it, and its to die for, thats all i can say. the service here is good and prompt.  they do have coffees and some bottled juices. they are temporarily running a promotion where if you dined at bouchon bistro and show your receipt, you can receive 25 off your order at the bakery.  the 25 off is only good at the clock tower location.  it will not work at the location under the escalator. i love bouchon bakery, i just wish there was more selection here.
we decided to try base after reading a local news piece about it.we had been to the predecessor restaurant in the space and base initially appeared to have done very little to change the rectangular strip mall feel of the restaurant. they have however added a nice patio, and the phoenix fall weather was perfect for an evening outside.we entered the restaurant and the 1st thing we noticed was the absence of a host desk, and indeed a host. the place was half full, with one large table of about a dozen people and a  couple of 4 tops occupied inside and a few tables occupied on the patio.we waited patiently for someone to notice us and after about 5 minutes, during which we thought about leaving, someone came up to us and greeted us.this laissezfaire approach was unfortunately a harbinger of the service to come.we were seated and it took several more minutes for the table to be cleaned and menus provided. interestingly there were zero condiments on the table. no salt, pepper, olive oil or balsamic vinegar.the menu is small, which is probably a good idea for a new restaurant. the primary dishes are all interesting sounding pizzas, but phoenix has a surfeit of excellent neapolitan style thin crust pizza places, so we were hoping it would be good.we ordered a caprese salad to split while we waited for our pizzas. the caprese took at least a half hour and during this wait nothing other than water was offered. we asked for some lemon for the water, but it never showed up. no bread either, to tide us over as they clearly struggled to serve the large party inside.it was a pleasant evening and we had some catching up to do on the days events so we bided our time.the salad arrived and was delicious. i asked for a little more olive oil, but by the time it arrived we were already done.a while later, at least 15 minutes, our waiter came by to say the pizzas were on their way out any second. it turned out that a second at base is at least 10 minutes long.finally the pizzas arrived. one was a classic with added fennel sausage and the other was mediterranean inspired with olives and artichokes.at first bite the ingredients were fresh and lovely but the crust was baked way too hard. not burnt, but literally stiff as a board with no moisture in it. the pizza edges could be used as nails to hold down a tent. disappointing to say the least.to their credit they recognized the disarray in their service and comped the salad but im not sure they are worth a repeat visit, especially with so many other good pizza places nearby. pomo in scottsdale comes to mind.prices were about what you should expect at a good pizza place but they need to figure out how to put some moisture back in their crust, and they certainly need to figure the logistics of service.a host to greet diners would also be a nice improvement
my dog has had an on again off again problem with early morning vomiting for over two weeks. we did everything we possibly cold to try and figure out what was going on before we went to the vet. tag, my dog, has racked up over 5k in medical bills for us. he has always been struggling with something but after his 2k surgery back in january i dread going to the vet now because tag is so dang expensive. but he is my baby and i was so worried about him so off to the new vet down the street. the facility is extremely clean and since they are so new they dont have a huge clientele yet so i got an appointment same day. i knew going into the appointment that i was going to be leaving with at least a 150 bill since i wanted to get xrays done to rule out any sort of intestinal blockage. we left with a  460 bill. the x rays were outrageous. my prior vet in henderson charges 150 for 3 views and my bill was 190 for two views and and extra view at 60! as far as the hospital, its so clean which is great and they put me in a room right away when i came in. the vet was attentive and clear in his decision for the treatment of our issue but what happens so often after with tag  i leave i feeling so dumb founded why this happened in the first place. that was also the case this time..i left knowing that he didnt have an intestinal blockage but i also left with buyers remorse for not sticking with my regular, far more reasonably priced, vet.
yelp top 100? i dont get it. its just a normal ice cream place, and not even that good of one. also, they charge you 50 cents for using a credit card? ill bring my checkbook next time i come have ice cream in 1965. the service was very helpful and friendly. i dont remember the girls name, but she said she was from venezuela.
i like this place. i think that a lot of people jumped on a bandwagon and decided to slam the new owners and i wholeheartedly disagree with most of what people are saying. granted, its not really a gelato...so fine, change the name, but to say that its overpriced, chemically tasting or too sweet is absurd. the product is good and theyre teamed up with other local confectioners like popped and jeanmarie auboune. give it a try, decide for yourself. haters gonna hate.
i went to get my brows done, they were done well. the receptionist was really unfriendly though on the phone and in person, as if you are bothering her. once i got there and told her about my appointment she gave me an estimate time and thats it,  no you can wait here or anything, so i just kinda stood there and had to ask if i could sit somewhere. she did the same with someone else after, the person was just as confused as i was. it looks like a very nice place with lots of potential it but seems poorly organized empty shelves with some random items on them, half empty bottles of polishes as decoration. i would have come back but aint nobody got time for attitude, life is tough enough.
stopped in here for the souvlaki lunch special for 8.95 today.  your choice of pork or chicken along with fries or rice and a drink of your choice.  food was well prepared.  the restaurant is well suited to take out, there are a limited number of tables available, and the bathroom was not well equipped. good value for the money, the food is fresh and tasty.  ambience lacking for dining.  would return and recommend for take out. so id say the food is four stars the dining experience 3 stars.
its great to see a new place open up on this stretch of bellechasse, nicely located on the bike path. with big windows and dark brick, the interior catches one by surprise by how bright it is.one of my main reflections was that the cafe seems to be in flux. it is clear that the owners are still trying to sort out some of the kinks in operations and customer experience. one thing that they can improve is rapport with clients. my coffee was pretty good, but chefs and barristas gave a bit of a frat feel, and the service was pretty icey. i also noticed that they were brewing coffee from cafe rico, which is great as they are a local roaster, and they have a team of cooks making things behind their open air kitchen  in fact the whole cafe has a modern feel with cool colours and sparse furnitures. if youre nearby, try it out
cozy and nice little coffee shop by the water.  went there the first week it opened and wasnt wowed by the coffee...2 other tables sitting outside were impressed by their coffee either.i will give it another try later and see if any improvement.
the store is large, new, and clean. they offer many different discounts to help lower the overall cost of purchases. it is mostly well organized. however, there was no organization to the books. they are just a jumbled mass. i was unwilling to look through every book on every shelf to try to determine if there were any i would want to buy. i couldnt find any organization to the shoes, either. it could just be that i didnt look closely enough because i was trying to get away from the strong perfume smell by the front door. i noticed i couldnt get away from the smell, and i began getting a headache and watery eyes. i saw that they actually spray scent all around the store. i wouldnt be able to go back there because of this. anyone who has chemical sensitivities needs to stay away from this store.
25 military discount on mondayswent on sunday 91315 around 3pm.  this location opened very recently yet it is already a mess inside. i love thrifting but i dont like digging.  the childrens clothing is all mixed together on two racks.  at least savers separates the clothing by size and gender.  i looked through the xl rack of womens shirts.  every other one was actually an xl.  in the womens dresses rack marked xl i did not find one dress that was xl.  the bathrooms were already in disrepair.  the toiletseatcoverholder had a thick layer of dust on it and the sink looked like it hadnt been cleaned in years.  how is it this gross less than a month after opening? they did have quite a few larger items and furniture, much more than savers. and the young black cashier was chatty and nice.  thats about all i have to say about this location.  step up your game, goodwill!
found a screw in my bread last week...bit down on it and hurt like hell. cashier froze when i told her. re made my sandwich but didnt receive an apology.  firehouse is better than this. ..
 overallaww, it was a hard decision to make. i would say my impression from yori q was like jason williams. able to produce sparkling moments, but produces 5 turnovers. i would definitely come back for spicy pork buns but im not sure if they would be as good as the ones i had this time, given the inconsistent quality of food i had. i did get an impression that i would like this place more as a bar. good1. spicy pork buns  insanely good. i havent tasted a better balanced korean fusion dish.2. side dishes  it was great to see chung po mook in us.3. service  the server was gentle and careful. too bad that i do not remember his name.4. atmosphere  one of the best in town.5. gamja tang  i wouldnt say it is 100 authentic but still it wasnt bad at all. bad1. spicy dak bulgogi  one of the chicken pieces had bones in it. one point from gryffindor.2. rice  we had two bowls of rice and one of them were seriously undercooked.
decent food but could use some adjustments. i enjoyed the corn pancake appetizer a lot, it was delicious and chockfull of corn. i had the dolsat bibambap for my entree and it wasnt the best. i dont eat a lot of bibambap but this one had way too much rice and not enough stuff. there were also only about 4 or 5 very small pieces of bulgogi. i know bibambap is vegetable focused, but this was just disappointing. the worst part was the fried egg in the bibambap. it arrived at our table with a completely rock solid yolk. even worse, the bowl next to mines yolk was not only rock solid, but also broken, leaving a dried up trail around the bowl. not good. however, the pork neck bone soup was well received and pleasantly spicy. the bulgogi entree was also very good, generous portion of beef to make up for the complete lack of beef in the bibambap. i didnt try the hot pot which they are supposedly known for. id recommend this place for bulgogi or soupshot pot, but id stay away from the bibambap.
great service, uneven food.  the spicy pork slider was excellent.  the corn jeon pancake is pretty good too.  the gamja tang  spicy pork neck bone soup was sweatinducing good  pungent, spicy, with large gelatinous pieces of neck bone stuff  old school food at its best.  the bulgogi is made with ribeye and is tasty.   the dolset bibimbap was not so good  wheres the meat?  customers were all panasian types; looking around, most were getting hot pots of various types.  next time will need to try one of those.
pretty standard korean fare. a bit overpriced compared to old standbys like woorijib.
brand new location on s rainbow, just north of charleston. i stopped by last wednesday for a haircut, to see if their stylists were any good compared to the location by my house. after waiting a short while, i got a haircut from teresa, who is also the manager. although she did a great job and this was probably one of the better cuts i have gotten at a great clips, she spent a lot of time talking to other employees and attempting to do other tasks which took time from focusing on my cut and was very awkward at times. this place would be great if everyone focused a little more and waited to do administrative tasks after the haircut you already started is finished, manager or not.
brand new place with a drive through. the drive through has no speaker just a large touch screen. you can choose most everything you want on it but i did not see a tab for dressings at the end. i like a little honey mustard on my tuna and must have missed it. on a cold day ordering out here would not be the way to go. the pick up window is small and tight to the building and easy to miss. i missed it the first time and had to go around the building to look again. the tuna sub i got was dry and one of the worst tasting i have had at a subway. the tuna was just not mixed right. my wife got the second half of my footlong and agreed. i would go back but not  until it has a chance to get up to speed with the other subways and would go into the building this time.
heres the deal, the food actually is excellent, the place is nice and cozy, the staff is really friendly, the bathrooms are clean and the price per dish is decent. so why 3 stars? the portions are tiny so much so that we felt insulted.weve been to lots of fancy places before and this is a tapas restaurant so we knew portions would be small but we left so hungry that we had to go to a second restaurant to have a proper meal. were not big people either.lets look at what we got. one dish was a tomato nectarine creme salad. there 13rd of a tomato, a fourth of a nectarine and about 14th of a cup of creme fresh that had a bit of seasoning in it... 9. two bites and it was gone.the scallop dish was 1 scallop cut thinly in 6 pieces with some dehydrated strawberry pieces and fresh strawberries . delicious? yes absolutely but really, one scallop? as for the strawberries, fresh  dehydrated amounted to maybe 2 small ones.the lasagna for 2 was superb and the only dish that was decent in size for tapas  but dont let the name fool you, one person can easy have two these, theyre definitely not big enough for two.i wont even bother explaining the calamari dish, there was barely anything there.the plates are delicious but theyre half the size of what they should be. youll easily rack a bill of 200 for two people and leave hungry. its a real shame, the food was great but unless they fix the portion size, we wont be going back.
went today after reading the reviews on yelp.  really wanted to try something different as i have drank boba for years. the staff is friendly but i really felt rushed to hurry and order and there was no one in line behind me.  i wound up with a taro milk tea and my friend wanted a healthy fruit flavored drink.  they recommended a lychee tea which she said was very sour...... and she didnt care for it, which made me feel bad.  even gave me the wrong size drinks.....boo!!   would i go back, probably. but i wont drive out of my way to get there.  the guy who made my tea was really nice, the cashier just really hustled me which wasnt cool at all.
i have to say i love the concept and the modo if you dont like your drink they will make you another one! the guys here really do ami to please  it the drinks a sort of a tease.  i dont not like their drinks but i wasnt crazy about the drinks that i thought were going to be amazing. first time here i order the rose bud tea and even though it looks so good and so pretty i wasnt a fan. to me i felt like it had a weird fermented taste or kimchi flavor. i know sounds completely crazy but then again thats what i thought. it had honey in it but the flavor was very vague. then i came back to try another drink and was excited about the sea salt foam. i ordered the oolong green tea with foam and honey boba. when i got it i was thrilled that it had good tea flavor chilled but the boba itself was not that amazing. it was pretty bland and lacking honey flavor. for the most part the boba was cooked perfectly i just wish it was a little sweeter. the foam was a nice touch but i guess it didnt really impress me much. i will definitely be back and ask for my drinks to be more sweeter to see if that will make a difference but for now my take on the brew tea bar is that all the drinks their starts of very bland. for now i like them but im not crazy about them the service and the bar itself is top notch but thats pretty much it.
somehow this hidden spot has been open six months, serving up a small selection of frenchinspired pastries and basic coffees. menu offers more variety than they had available in the display case during my visit, selection including cream puffs, millefeuille, tiramisu, baklava, and financiers with strawberry shortcake and strawberry cupcakes on display. price range for baked goods is generally 45item.coffee menu is short and does not seem to be the focus, despite the beverage coming first in the business name. my skinny vanilla latte was superhot and lightly flavored, no signage or information provided about the bean origin or if alternative milks are available.service was personable and professional. coffee was made to order, pastry was filled fresh rather than grabbed out of the case. storefront appears small, but dining area is larger than expected and there are a few small tables outside as well.
very high prices at this store but just like with the coop i come here out of necessity rather than choice. the selection here is awesome and the baked goods are great but, like i stated above, the prices are really bad and make it very difficult for a student to shop here.
our first sandwiches there were good.  i tried the lobster salad it was ok, lacking a little something but i couldnt put my finger on it.  my husband had the narmer.  the service was a bit slow but i saw 7 people putting together sandwiches one was the owner!, i can understand a good rush when i see one.  need to try another sandwich or two to see if they can make me a fan.
sandwiches are good. better than subway, but the wait for just a sandwich is ridiculous. i waited for a good 30 minutes!!!! if i didnt already pay i wouldve left. wont be going back for a while. i hope in time it gets better.
well its another sub place and i was curious what they do that the others dont. the bread is the same as subway but the freshness and quality do stand out. they have some funny names for their subs with sauces that come with them which is ok by me. mine was good, although i cant remember which one i had. they also have six soups that you can get as part of your meal. i didnt this time but will next. beware of the tuna here though. i had a taste test before ordering and it is loaded with onions. i was burping onions for an hour with just that one spoonful. if onions are for you go for it.i think its a mistake to mix it in before hand because it gets stronger and limit who will order it.  i prefer to add what i want on tuna like at the other sub shops.  this one will not be on my list if i go back.
i dont know. maybe its because its been so long, but i remember erbert  gerberts being better. or maybe my memory is just waxing nostalgic over the fact that in college, my buddies and i used to stumble in drunk late night saturday into the original store on water street in eau claire, wi. after getting our food, wed stumble the 30 yards back up to my buddies crappy college apartment above the store. or maybe ive been living in this area too long and have been tainted by milios being all over. i really dont know. not saying i wont ever eat erbs and gerbs again because theyre food is pretty good. its just that something has been lost to time which makes it taste just a tad different.
as far as buffets go, it was decent for the 24 brunch admission price. coffee was tasty and all you can drink champagne for brunch on saturdaysunday. the breakfast brunch foods were better than most eggs benedict, lox and bagels, french toast, omelette bar and everything was clean and presentable. our waiter was super attentive and we never had an empty coffee cup or champagne flute.
buffet for breakfast and dinner both had a great selection of food... my experience was cold food when should of been hot, california rolls stayed empty long time... best part of breakfast buffet was lailani.. she made experience fun enjoyable.. sweet lady..
brunch was good and i had a table all for myself. the selection for breakfast wasnt anything for me to jump up and down about but being it was walking distance to my hotel it was ok. the eggs needed more time cooking and the pancakes and french toast was not great. the lunch food was superb and dessert. if you really wanted to breakfast you probably would be disappointed but leaning towards lunch its great.
this is a pretty good buffet, and i would have given it a 4 if i hadnt seen their sushi. i was about to pick up some sushi when i noticed it had brown avocado on the inside....aside from that the rest of the food looked fresh. they have a great salad bar, good soup, deserts, fish, etc. however the golden days of this buffet have passed. when westgate was lvh, the buffet was excellent. it had crab legs,eggs benedict, smoked salmon, sushi. i have not seen any of that in a couple years at least. aside from that, this is a good place to eat if you are not expecting to have seafood. they dont have any luxury items at the buffet but the quality is good, except for the sushi. cost is 25 for dinner, and a little less for brunch.
this is not one of those fancy buffets in vegas but food is average and proportional to what you pay. we actually got lucky and found a coupon in our room for a buy one, get one free buffet so my husband and i decided to give it a shot. went on a sunday for their brunch. both of us ate for 25 and couldnt complain.
i decided to give dons ny pizza a try since they were so close to my house. when i went to get my pies there was a hostess a waitress and the guy cooking the pies behind the counter. nobody even said hello to me which i thought was rude. i had to tell the waitress what i was there for.the pizza was kinda bland nothing to right home about.kinda pricey too the total came to 28.00 dollars for 2 large one topping pizzas.dont think i will be eating there again.
the pizza is okay. not as good as rays but similar. what was most disappointing is that they dont serve any beer. its really close to my house which was awesome but as soon as we realized they didnt serve any beer we ordered our pizza to go. most likely wont go back.
mille crepe cakes have finally hit charlotte! when you get to the gallery, its a lovely spot with cool art and great decor. however, since they are relatively new, they are not yet a wellgreased running machine.the seats werent all filled up, but they were having a hard time getting orders right. we ordered two macchiatos and mistakenly received an espresso instead. as for the cakes, they got frazzled and forgot our order. it took 3040 minutes just to receive our two cakes slices. they dont make them inhouse shipped frozen from ny, so why the wait? they forgot to apologize too.the green tea mille crepe cake was very light and not too sweet so it was yummy. and one of the ladies were very nice about our couronne cake just being defrosted so we could change it if we would have liked. go here if you have the time for the mille crepe cakes. everything else, you can go to dean  delucaamelies and have it taste the same. or you can just order lady m cakes for yourself as they ship out. it would be the exact same thing.
located next to the steps near uncle maddios pizza is the new mcalisters deli location in the clt.  having heard they had opened about a week ago, i decided to try this location.  unfortunately or fortunately, i ventured to the restaurant on mcalisters national free tea day.  the place was slam; but i do love mcalisters tea.  therefore, the subliminal advertising worked as here i was on national free tea day!  atmosphere  crazy busy, inviting, small, narrow, felt more like the inside of a potbelly sandwich shop than any of the mcalisters delis i have been to in the past.service  friendly greeted quickly and politely at the entrance and asked if i would like a free tea, helpful told that if i ordered using the website or app i could bypass some of the linefood  this location appears to have the full menu of the standalone locations.  with that, i ordered my regular grilled chicken or as they call it one of their classic sandwiches.  this sandwich comes with grilled chicken breast, lettuce, tomatoes, swiss, and honey mustard, all on a toasted croissant with a pickle on the side.  i ordered mine without swiss and a side of fruit.  after i got back to my desk and opened the box, the sandwich looked a little smashed.  when i started to eat the sandwich i noticed that the normal from what i recall single  whole chicken breast was replaced by sliced chicken typical in a salad with chicken added.  while i still enjoyed my sandwich, it was just too messy.  i chalk this up to them either running out of whole chicken i ordered after 1pm or a change by mcalisters deli.  the side of fruit was decent in combination and taste, but lacked in quantity.  the iced tea was awesome as always.    overall  national free day was probably not the best day for judging this location.  however, despite the hectic crowd, the staff here remained calm and friendly which was definitely a positive for this location.  since its so close to my office and i do like their chicken sandwich on the croissant i am sure ill be back and hopefully with an improved experience.
mcalisters deli has now opened in uptown charlotte, in the old sbarros location.  it has been opened for several weeks, but the line has been too long for me to check it out.  however, yesterday, i was able to get away early and was there just before 11:30, just before the line started to grow.the menu includes items similar to other mcalisters locations, however, the space is limited and the ordering process can be confusing, as there are multiple lines with very little space to see where you are supposed to go.  this location has less than 10 tables and several stools along the wall, so prepare to get there early, if you would like to eat there, or know this is a lunch to go spot.i chose the you pick two, ordering a 12 club and a cup of tortilla soup. the tortilla soup was good, but definitely lacked the kick that i like.  as for the sandwich, a lot of meat and was very good, although the bread was a little stale.i am glad to see there is another sandwich spot in uptown, however, not sure how often i will be able to enjoy it, due to the lines, and honestly i think there are better spots in the area.
i have been waiting for close to a year for this location to open since it is so convenient to home. i must say that everyone is very friendly and you are greeted by staff as you work your way through the store. its nice that it is new and clean but the selection was only ok. actually the childrens clothing department was a disappointment. i went there looking for back to school clothes for my son and couldnt find anything as the selection was very small. i did walk out of there with the odd combination of a garden sculpture and a spatula so i didnt leave empty handed. its close to home so i am sure i will stop by there again but it wont be with any regularity.
the food here is the reason village pub is getting 3stars. one of the main bartenders did not give my husband and i very good service. she only paid attention to the regulars and hardly asked us how we were doing. waited with our empty plates for well over 10 minutes before she came back to us. she also made both of us feel incompetent when we asked for a different side because the one we received tasted funny. not good customer service. we might return of we do not sit at the bar. my husbands steak and my wrap were very good. they only have their beers on tap, so be prepared for that though ive heard they are good.
came during hh at the suggestion of other reviews: its 3pm6pm, monfri, fyi. halfoff limited drinks, no food specials. only the original margarita is discounted down to 5, and its a fullsized glass instead of the typical lowball glass one might expect. i dont know if id splurge the 10 for a specialty version, but the lychee one sounds delicious.food menu is pretty basic, with twotaco plates running 10, additional options for burritos and nachos. they get bonus points for offering vegetarian options and barbacoa, which has been difficult to find in las vegas their version isnt great, but its adequate. the 7 order of nachos 2 for protein is on par with chipotle in terms of size, taste, and price. the service was really great, mario and his sidekick were friendly and outgoing and checked up on us frequently. aside from that, this place was a bit more average than i had hoped for. considering hussongs has been around 120 years, the food was very americanized... as were the prices.
food is pretty good i had the kung pow chicken bowl my girl had the baja fish tacos. we went there on a friday night when the bar was the only thing open. the bartenders had to be waiters and make drinks so we didnt get that great of service since we decided to sit at a table. i had to go to the bar to get my bill after sitting there for a while thinking that they were going to come to me to give me my bill. almost thought i was getting the meal compd i mean hey its vegas. i  did like the food and the margarita so i may go again just will make sure to go when they are open full service.
really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place and what we tried of the food was amazing. the habanero mango guacamole was the best guac i have ever had. the set up for ordering and seating is very confusing and i noticed a lot of people left assuming they would get served. i think for this place to be successful it would need to probably change this .
the tacos are decent, the guacamole is good, unfortunately the margaritas are less than desirable. all you can taste is lime juice because they put them in a giant 16 oz glass. im sorry, but i like to taste tequila in my margaritas.
we thought the service and staff were great.  the food was good but nothing spectacular, a little better than average.  the prices were not bad either, pretty reasonable for being in boca park.
ill give this three stars because i have only tried the chickensteak plate. the chicken was pretty good. the salad is about three fork fulls, but the dressing is tasty. the steak portion was pretty nasty. not what i was expecting at all. i paid for avocado and didnt get it with my order. :  pretty disappointed for my first visit, but will maybe venture back to try the chicken salad plate. will definitely stay away from the steak.
kind of like panda express with fewer options and a 30 price increase. all the food was cooked and seasoned well. of course, as is appropriate with the type of food, they start with cheap skirt steak and chicken bits, so you may get a bit of gristle, but it was minimal and tasted good and was tender. id come back if nearby, but wouldnt search it out.
okay healthier food.  good friendly helpful service.  had chicken shrimp, veggies and brown rice.  veggies were 75 cabbage not a fan  they give you a lot of rice.   chicken and steak were decent.   shrimp was blah.  probably wont be back unless i am looking to go healthier than the better options in area.
its pretty average in taste, its slightly better in price. its filling, and although ive found the chicken to have more than the desired amount of fatty pieces, the amount spent is fair. the service is good, both visits with a smile and chipper attitude. im a sucker for chicken teriyaki, so ill be stopping in from time to time.
the smoothie i got was good, but it did take them about 15 minutes just to make it. they werent busy, the workers just were talking to each other rather than doing their job. also the employees were unfriendly, and rather rude.
pleasant staff and enthusiastic server who knew the menu.  we had the potato pancakes, wiener schnitzel and jaeger schnitzel.  the potato pancakes were more like a hash brown style than the heavier variety i have had at some german restaurants.  very good.  the schnitzel dishes were good but i prefer my schnitzel made with veal rather than pork in terms of flavor so i found them a little bland.  if i lived in the area, i would return.
it was a friday night around 5:45pm and already very busy.  we were luckily seated right away as its difficult to wait with a 3 year old.  the beer list is good, and the menu is what youd expect.  we started w the potato pancake which i thought was too thick and heavy.  i like them thinner and crispier but it was ok.  we ordered our daughters chicken fingers with the appetizer so she could begin eating.  our entree order was placed at the same time as the appetizer but came out well after our daughter had finished and we were questioning whether our server forgot to put the order in.  finally when they showed up, both schnitzels respectively, they were good.  the wait was excessive....but id probably come back in the winter when i was in the mood for a nice german meal.
i hate to give this place 3 stars, the food is good, somethings are much better then others. the bone in jagerschnitzel is wonderful, the schweinbacken, the ravioli thing, all are wonderful and should not be missed. the beer is out of this country good. the service is ok for a new place. but what is now turned my wife and i away is the angry man in the corner. i guess hes the owner but to sit and stare at the host and the customers for 2 hours was strange. maybe things werent going right in his eyes but its the second time he done that. if you have a problem fix it, dont sit and make everyone uncomfortable.we wont be back if hes in the restaurant.
the first time ive had schweinhaxen was in a hong kong cafe in the san gabriel valley. they called it a german style pork knuckle and it was beautiful with crackled pork skin, tender meat and melty tendons. since returning to madison, ive been on the hunt for as amazing a schweinhaxen as i had in la. after all, were in wisconsin where german culture abounds. but schweinhaxen wasnt that easy to find. it wasnt on many menus except for the essen haus, which was okay but falls flat compared to what a hong kong cafe dished up. when i saw a picture of the schweinhaxen in this weeks isthmus for freiburg gastropub, i had to visit and try it out. and well, im still thinking about the hong kong cafe version. frieburgs schweinhaxen was tasty and better than the essen haus version, but it still didnt have that beautiful crackled pork skin.we also ordered the huhn  roast chicken with spaetzle. ive never been a fan of spaetzle, or any little mounds of dough cooked in water for that matter. never understood the appeal of gnocchi, or the korean spicy rice cake ddeokbokki. it seems like what others love about these dishes is the texture of the dough  soft and pillowy they say. okay. but tonight, freiburg changed my mind. their version of spaetzle was delicious. buttery and well, soft and pillowy. i was a fan. i also really enjoyed their potato and apple mash. you couldnt quite taste the apple, but it lightened up the mashed potatoes, and gave it a subtle sweetness. i would come back, but im not in love.
