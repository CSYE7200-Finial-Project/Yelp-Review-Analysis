the soup and salads were good. one of us ordered a pizza. not good. to soggy and undercooked. dont let the what looked like a wood burning oven oven mislead you. my lagzana was also undercooked. the cheese was not melted but it used good ingredientsplease dont review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if youre connected in any way to the owner or employees.
my first time was fantastic our waiter yule was awesome!! the food was delicious. tonight was a disaster. plastic in the ravioli is not acceptable on any level.
forgot about the happy hour free appetizer in yelp. the deal was two full course meals for 29.95 which runs sundays thru thursdays. everything was good chopped salad, bread, entree and dessert but waiter didnt attend to our empty waters. well go back! large portions not like some restaurants. they discontinued the deal for two dinners at 29.95. they said it was just for the holiday season. well i thought it still was the holiday season thru new years day. the place was empty so split a pizza not great and had two chopped salads. wish we had gone elsewhere.
was really impressed upon our initial arrival. real contemporary feel, with an art deco design. we ordered our food. the bacon tater tots were good as well as the buffalo cauliflower. next came the margherita pizza. as our waitress was setting it on the table i noticed a bug crawling on it. i pointed it out to her right away. she looked at it and was visibly shaken, and said out loud oh, no! she immediately took the pizza back to the kitchen. not really feeling like eating anything at this point we just asked for our bill. we only had the two appetizers.next she came back with the manager who proceeded to blame the bug on the fact that they keep their doors open all night. i dont care if you are cooking in the middle of the jungle, food should not have bugs in it. although we had plan to pay our bill, it would have been nice to have been offered to offset the bill, or offer a complimentary dessert, or something. the manager acted as if we were trying to take a shot, or something. we just feel like this situation could have been handled differently. sadly, we will most likely never go back there. we really liked the vibe.i would have only given this place one star, however our waitress, julianne was a sweetheart.
bland food. undercooked rice and overcooked bread. the roasted poblano with quinoa was missing something in the flavor department nice kick but the stuffing was missing a nice flavor. the mezze plate with overcooked hard to rear bread. hummus was lacking olive oil and needed some paprika to kick it up to the standard of good hummus. service was subpar and the menu was limited. wont be back.
cool place. not so great if you want good service, sat at the bar area ordered a beer and two glasses of wine. it took a little over 15 minutes for the drinks, and then the waitress couldnt remember who got what. place wasnt horribly busy either. sad, seems like this place could be a lot of fun but not sure well be back.
it truly hurts me to say this...the excellent food and drinks did not make up for the absolutely pitiful service our group of four received.  it was 40 minutes before we were served our first round, plus another 40 minutes for the second round.  i should also mention when i asked our waitress what their house red wine was, she replied chardonnay.  that should have been my exit move.two additional confused servers tried to give us other peoples food which looked amazing, btw. when i very politely and discreetly inquired as to the receipt of our drinks, our server, who shall remain nameless, blamed me for coming in for happy hour.  ouch.
food was good..decor was cool ..service .. not so good. took 30 minutes to get a beer and this was at 4pm in the afternoon. cant even image if they were busy. wanted to love this place but just couldnt based on service only.
i went here with some friends for happy hour on a thursday evening. we were very disappointed by the service. overall it appeared there was lots of miscommunication between the staff. i understand its a new restaurant but nonetheless it was still disappointing. we waited over 20 minutes to get our first round of drinks. our waiter forgot one drink and we had to remind him multiple times to bring it. after drinking my beer, i realized it didnt taste like a hefeweizen. i asked the waiter if it was the right beer and he then told me that they ran out of hefeweizen.. so why would he serve me something i didnt order? turns out he gave me the missing drink, mixing up our orders. so i went to the bar to order a different beer... they actually did have hefeweizen! then our food was entirely mixed up! multiple servers kept coming by with food that we had already received or hadnt ordered. we had to ask multiple times for our truffle fries. the kitchen was kind enough to send out complimentary chicken wings due to all the trouble. not sure if ill be back...
meh. i really want to like this place. beautiful interior. staff really tries good service. i felt like they are still knowing the ropes. food: we got the fig and prosciutto pizza, expected figs, guessing it was fig sauce. arugula was overkill overtook the prosciutto. chopped salad: needs contrast. it was all fatty texture and crunch. im saying it.. bland. charcuterie plate: it was all bread. 2 meats 5 slices each. deviled eggs: nothing new, just add very crispy bacon stabbed on top. the only redeeming thing i would go back to is my drink: players cut. just add more luxardo cherries.
yikes. what. a. nightmare. which is really frustrating because conceptually, its really cool. i love that they dont serve any of the mainstream beers, but everything is craft driven. heres where it fails miserably. the cocktails look like a 5 year old could have created them. not to mention the players club i believe its called is a negroni.. call it what it is! we came for desserts and oi vey... i dont think ive ever been more disappointed. i was so excited to try them i dragged my bf here after dinner for desserts. i got all three of them. the lemon meringue was dropped off first and since there wasnt silverware i dipped my finger in the meringue. it reeked. bad. once i got a spoon the lemon curd was completely separated which, from my experience in restaurants, means it wasnt kept at temp or it was old. it was terrible. i was also reallllllly excited to try to nutella cookie sandwich. again, what a let down. the cookies were hard, old and tasted like they were bought at the grocery store. again, really unfortunate considering how amazing this place could be.
i really wanted to love this place. we live near downtown summerlin and were so excited to try out a new restaurant. sadly, this place was beyond disappointing, but considering they are still working on getting the kinks out, we may be back.positives:1 great setting, fun ambiance, great outdoor space with games, and fairly large space to get seated quickly.2 variety of interesting food and drink selections on the menu at a good price; good happy hour offerings3 the ahi tacos and calamari were great. the blueberry lavender drink was tasty, but did not come with the sprig of lavender as pictured. think it needed more lavender.negatives:1 i ordered the ahi tuna tacos on the appetizer menu and asked that the tacos and slaw salad i ordered on the side come out together as my entree. the taco came out first, even before the appetizer we ordered and my salad came way later.2 my husband ordered a burger medium. it came out literally raw! it could have made him sick. they made him a new one and took it off our check.3 we ordered the nutella ice cream sandwich after reading all the great reviews. there was wax paper in our cookie which was used to put the ice cream on the sandwich. additionally, the cookie was extremely hard and inedible. 4 a manager came to talk to us only after the food critic seated next to us told him what a bad experience we had. my only problem with this is that the server did not tell the manager to come talk to us after we received poor quality food. we talked to the manager who did not seem very apologetic but did give us his card if we wanted to come back. they should have comped us our meal based on our experience, but alas no offers. i am understanding that the restaurant is new. unlike lazy dog which is around the corner and trained their staff for two weeks prior to opening, public school 702 seems to be lacking in food and service. i am hoping this will be worked out in the future. as i stated above, its a great spot and a shame if things dont pick up. it can only go up from here!
pounding club music, tattooed hipsters, and marginal food. this restaurant caters to the 10 years behind san francisco scene.  looooong wait over an hour  bartenders who do not scan their section but rather focus on who is sitting directly in front of them. during a busy service, scan your section to check drinks and serve anyone who looks like they need service, and then hustle! wouldnt go back.
great food, too bad the service is bad! we have been there twice the first time we received our food before our drinks and the second time we sat at the bar and with 4 bartenders behind the bar it took them almost 10 minutes to approach us. when we were finally approached our bartender took our drink order asked if i wanted a sample of a beer brought me the glass of beer instead went to the well to make the servers drinks for about 10 minutes, i had to call over another bartender to tell him that it was supposed to be a sample and that i didnt like it. he started taking our food order she came back in the middle of the order and said sorry for not giving me a sample, went back to the well and we never saw her again. we asked for water and they didnt bring it. we had to ask again. im in the service industry so i know how it is when the bar gets busy. our lounge is one of the busiest in las vegas but if you are overwhelmed ask for help. hopefully it will get better as time goes on. one word of advise, dont have your bartender that is in the well also waiting on patrons. she obviously couldnt handle it and ignoring her guest looks bad on you. also, when garnishing your drinks, dont use your fingers! that is against health code and disgusting!
this was a nightmare experience. 4 of us went for lunch. server was one of worst ive ever had around all my travels. then ,im told they have at least 10 days of training. i dont think so. we asked for water, waited,waited, wanted to order, had to find our server. yes we saw her, standing near back, just standing. not once did she come back to refill water or to see about our drinks. had to ask another server to get our check for us. waited again, finally took payment to bar as katherine never came back. i asked the hostess to speak to manager when we were leaving, her reply  theyre busy . im an out of state guest, 2 people were vegas residents. i will never go back, nor refer anyone to this place.
not sure how this place will fair in the long haul. ive noticed that places like this in summerlin with fickle hours dont do well. they always close hours before their posted times. every time my wife calls to see when their closing they never give a straight answer. at least when we go for a beer at yard house we know theyll be open when they say they are.
the food was pretty good, but the poor service ruined our experience. i probably wont go back because there are so many other great choices in downtown summerlin. when our server first came over i asked her a question about one of the cocktails on the menu and she didnt know anything about it. we ordered drinks and an appetizer deviled eggs, they were very good. we had finished our drinks and appetizer and were sitting there holding our menus wanting to order food. she walked past us several times without stopping to ask if we wanted to order. we finally flagged her down and she said oh, i thought you already ordered, i guess that was a different table. we ordered the huntsman burger and the bison burger, both were pretty good. when our food came out we asked for a side of dressing, which we never got. our food was delivered by a runner and our server never checked back in to see of everything was ok. also, dont order soda, its a rip off. my husband ordered a diet coke, it came in a glass 8oz bottle that they charge 2.75 for. the need to work on their service if they want to stay open. hopefully they will because the decor is unique and the food was solid.
the service was extremely slow. it took 10 minutes to greet you when you say down. it took 45 minutes for the arrival of our meal. the food was not high quality.  i was told by my waiter that the steak salad had romaine lettuce, radish, balsamic vinaigrette. what came out was arugula, radish, and not so tasty vinaigrette. i was not impressed with the food or service.
great food. terrible service.when i got seated i was given a menu to look at. after that, i waited a long time for my server to come back and take my order. i tried looking directly at her as a signal to show i was ready to order and i did see her look back at me. also, she walked by my table several times without stopping to take my order. i was pretty fed up and asked another worker if he could find my server but he went ahead and just took my order anyways, right after that another server came and introduced himself to us and said our server is switching sections and he will be taking over but i still see the server i had assisting tables that were right next to mine. i get having to switch sections but im offended she started off with us and left halfway without saying anything.our second server was great and attentive unlike the first one i had.
ill give this only two stars. we show up for happy hour and it is packed. no room at the bar, so we ended up sitting outside but getting our items inside because i guess you cant have happy hour anywhere else in there. this really wasnt an issue. after ordering drinks and food the female bartender told us to check back for our drinks and food because she would be unable to bring it out due to the bar being so busy. i waited 10 mins for the beer, ask if drinks were ready and she said no. ok no problem, i am patient. food came out about 5 mins later delivered by the same bartender. still no drink, so i said forget it. after finishing i asked for the bill, she gives it to me but there is no itemized list, who doesnt give you an itemized bill at a restaurant. so when i asked for one she got angry. i get an itemized bill and that beer that we never got is on there. so i explained that we never got the beer and she told me she put it there, apparently just after i asked her if it was ready and i walked out to the patio. how is that fair. so she says, after i stated my complaint that she can give me the beer or she would have to get her manager to refund. well im done here so i would like a refund for what i didnt receive. by the way she said this very rude. finally i get my corrected bill. and after signing it along with a correct tip, the bar tender tells me, next time just get your food a beer outside. um, how about i just dont come back next time. food was good, but not good enough to go though that again. one other complaint, pretty sure the bartender did something to my debit card, since leaving there i had to order a new one because it will not work anymore no matter what tricks a cashier has. its done.
food was good ... service was terrible to say the least. bartender totally distracted and not interested out server talked way too much about his life story...we had sirancha tator tots...yummy but the poor service dominated the evening
so, bring me new silverware when you take my appetizer plates away. dont make me put my silverware back on your dirty placemats to use again. this isnt mcdonalds.our server didnt even look at us when talking to us or taking out order. he was watching something on the other side of the restaurant.  he was rude and condescending. the bartenders were very nice and made some good cocktails. i liked the players cup. unfortunately our server made our visit to public school an unpleasant experience.
food was ok.   our server seemed very unsure of herself. i had 3 diet cokes and didnt learn until the bill came that they charge for each drink. my friend ordered her burger without a bun, and server came back 3 times with questions. the burger and fries were good but with my diet cokes, i spent 30 for lunch.  server dropped off our credit card slips and no thank you or have a nice day. poor customer service. dont think i will be returning.
i really wish i could give public school a better review. their menu and beer selection is good and there are some unique items but at the end of the day, its just another yardhouse, bjs, etc. vegas has a million of these places already so it really didnt stand out in any significant way. the theme and decor are pretty cool though so that was a bit of a different spin on things. i had the shrimp and grits, were were tasty and a portion that was a decent size. my wife had the chicken and waffles were were a large portion and very good. fatherinlaw had a jalapeno and pepperoni pizza that he liked and mominlaw had fish and chips...they looked nice and she said they were ok. thats the good. now time for the bad.service was ok but not great. it was a busy friday night but still...not the best. my meal really wasnt very hot considering it was being served in a skillet so my bet is that it was sitting under a heat lamp for a few minutes. it was just hot enough to eat and not cold enough tow warrant sending it back but it should have been hotter. while they do have a decent selection of brews, their prices were really high for what you were getting. once you start charging 9 for a pint, thats getting to be a bit obnoxious, regardless of what kind of microbrew it came from. all of that is insignificant though by comparison to the noise. let me make this as clear as possible. this place is so fucking loud!!! ive been to metallica concerts that werent as loud as eating in this place. seriously, if you are planning on having any form of conversation during your meal, you need to bring a bullhorn and set the volume on that sucker to 11. if you are not planning on having a conversation, earplugs should be mandatory. when we all left, it felt so pleasant to just hear a little silence for a few minutes. the noise alone is the reason none of us would ever return, so in case you missed it the first time, this place is fucking loud inside!!!!!!!!!!!!!
if youre going to claim that you service brunch, serve more than just a few items.   disappointed to get here and see only a handful of items.   no omelette, no pancakes, no fruit, no granola.    curry chicken and waffles is great im sure  but youve gotta offer some basic brunch items.  i may or may not try this spot again for lunch or dinner.   seemed like a nice place...just dont go for brunch.
really cool concept for the whole restaurant. the decor, the white boards, and the menu made you feel like your were back in elementary school. i just wished the service and the food was better!foodnothing really special here. we tried a number of the appetizers the bacon cheddar tots, the buffalo cauliflower, and the calamari along with a couple of drinks, but they were all pretty basic. the appetizers and the drinks were around 10 each. nothing that i would rave about or come back for. the drinks were good and i did like the fact that they have a variety of beers on tap, but other than that i would not come back solely for the food.servicethis is the main reason why i am only giving them a 2 star rating. our waiter didnt really seem like he knew what he was doing. he would take our orders and then come back to ask what they were again because he didnt write them down. when he had brought the water bottle to us, he also didnt pour any of it initially and when he saw our glass was empty, we were the ones to ask him to get another bottle of water instead of anticipating our needs. the other waiter delivering food passed us because she too was unsure where the food was to go. i felt like their system was clunky.logisticstheres never really any issue for parking when we go here. there also wasnt a wait to get in, so that was good. they have usbregular outlets where you can plug your phone in so that was cool.this place isnt bad. it looks nice and modern, but the service is poor. the managers need to retrain the staff if anything. i wouldnt recommend others to go here. try another place with better food and better service!
it was pretty underwhelming on my first visit. again, i usually dont write a review after 1 visit.. but we were pretty unhappy when we left. it started with arriving at 10 pm after being told that the menu goes until 1 am. not so.. late night menu started at 10 pm appearantly. there was a pretty mediocre selection of food at that point, but we figured we drove all the way out there so we would give it a try. this was after we were given the full menu. but heres how it all went.. we ordered drinks and found seats at the bar. sat in front of a bartender that cleaned her well for literally 15 minutes without even looking up. like, literally a foot from my face. nothin. so my friend says, what time do you close? she says  its different every day, and she went back to cleaning. my other buddy says, but we can still order food right? she says nothing, hands us late night menus, and a full menu and continues cleaning. without any other explanation. so we waited patiently as she polished the grate for the well, wiped it down and then walked away. it was bewildering. my buddy had to ask another bartender that was passing by if we could order. the bartender said, well what time is it? lol! i said is about 1030.. he said ooooh let me check... he says. he gave us a thumbs up from the other end of the bar but did not return to take the order. so when he came to our end of the bar again  about 5 minutes later to pour a draft beer, my buddy just started ordering out loud. haha.. i mean we had no intention of being rude.. but we were trying way too hard to order, like noone was interested in serving us. we all had all worked and were there to eat. very hungry. there were 3 bartenders, and literally 9 people at the bar.. we were the only ones trying to eat, and just could not get service. so now im watching the original female bartender that was cleaning her bar well in front of us. she grabs a glass water bottle.. drinks from it, then grabs a bottle of what appeared to be lemon juice from the bar well  and we all watched as she poured lemon juice into her water bottle. she did this by touching the mouth of the lemon juice bottle to the mouth of the bottle she just drank from, then put the juice bottle back in the well. im in no way squeemish, though thats just kind of gross, not to mention just wrong. so far  wtf. so the food.. we finally had a chance to order and were told only the late night menu was available.. after all that  time..we made some decisions and were informed we couldnt order them. this is were an explanation when dropping the menus would have been helpful. so we ordered calamari, flavor was ok, not crispy at all despite being fried.. i mean, literally soggy. naked wings, all flats, no drums, which was weird but they were crispy and good.. deviled eggs.. good.. but the presentation were those of eggs that had been prepared and set out for a few minutes because the yolks were not looking so fresh, also we ordered truffle fries. the fries sucked. seriously. lukewarm, soggy, and served with preserved lemon aioli? i didnt understand that, i liked the aioli but not with these fries thats just me.. they did not get eaten, yet taken away by the bartender without question as to whether we were done or if there was some reason it was over 75 unfinished. so theres that.still very hungry we decided on the fig and prosciutto pizza and taleggio and mushroom pizza. im not even going to go into it becuase both were very sloppy in presentation and just mediocre in flavor overall. honestly. we ate most of the fig and prosciutto and less than half of the mushroom taleggio. what i will say about he pizzas   is that the female food runner that brought the food over, literally shoved my drink to the side as i was trying to move the dirty plates from the previous course out of the way, then quite obviously tossed both pizza plates onto the bar and walked away. i spun around like.. wtf? my buddies both just laughed because we were so just over it at this point. she looked miserable, and was taking it out on us! haha.. its laughable in retrospect, but i mean really?! she then walked to the end of the bar by the service well and started chewing on her finger nails. no joke. ok, so listen.. i am not trying to just be an angry diner about this.. but ill say it again: there is absolutely no reason for medocire food, or service in a town like las vegas. there are too many choices where people actually want to do the right thing, and serve a quality product.this experience was a fail, and we are all easygoing foodie kind of people. i have no intention to go back to public school 702, soley based on the service. i would have liked to try the regular menu, but this experience was just a bust for me. sorry  happy eating to you though!
my wife and i have been waiting to go here for a while, we finally made time to bring the family in. we went around 11:30, it was pretty busy, we were seated right away, which was good because we brought both kids. our waitress approached us as soon as we were seated and let us know about the menu and how everything works. we ordered for our kids right away and orders drinks for ourselves. my wife ordered a bloody mary and our waitress recommended a beer for me, so i decided to go with it. when she returned she brought the bloody mary and the kids drinks, 20 min or so went by and still no beer for me.... my wife decides to ask the waitress and she said there must be a problem at the bar, i noticed she went to the computer and put my beer through because she must have forgot to put it in. got my beer another 10 minutes later 30 min after i ordered it. the kids got sliders, and we ordered the huntsman burger and calamari to share. we got the burger no side plates and kids sliders but no calamari. the burger was delicious! once we finished our burger we asked the waitress if the calamari was coming out still. she went to the kitchen and returned with no calamari and told us our order was bumped..... not sure what that means or how that happened. we get the calamari 10 min later and ask to get it to go since we were already done with everything else.  the food was ok, the service wasnt so great.
holy crap. havent got the food yet but this place is so dam loud. wont be back. literally two people over, cant hear a dam thing. is this their first go around designing an eatery? sheesh.
ok drinks are excellent food is not a do over.  service is below the norm. i like the concept however too many other great restaurants in the downtown summerlin area.
tried the american burger. nothing special, just your standard, typical burger youd find in any ole restaurant. fries were lacking and soggy. hubby got the crispy chicken sandwich wkale salad. if you like blue cheese, get the salad. if not, it overpowers the salad. hubbys sandwich had a decent spicy flavor to it, but it was nothing special. also tried ahi tuna tacos to start. the dressing was nice and tart, but i would prefer it on a salad, not to flavor ahi. the ahi itself, being raw was a bit fishy wno flavor other than its fishiness.  i like downtown summerlin, but im not interested in coming back to public school 702.
saw our waiter one time after ordering. food was ok, not to die for. will be history once the newness has worn off! no supervision or manager?
1st visit was great, girl bartenders were cool. 2nd visit, sat at the bar and was just looked at by the male day bartender without a greet or acknowledgement. i just got up and left. wont be going back anymore.
i absolutely love the concept of this place. gastropub with great big space and a happy hour called recess? love it.  too bad the whole experience was pretty subpar. in short, our whole 2 hour experience can be summed up as: really really hot outside seating, poor service, and mediocre food : the happy hour is only available in the bar area or on half of the outside patio. considering this is las vegas, if youre opening up happy hour on the outside patio, id hope you could spare some misters or working fans for the area.....or not. i guess we can just sweat it out overheat  ___;;fine, if youre not providing us any cooling methods, at least make sure we have enough water? is that too much to ask? yes, it absolutely is. we had to flag down our waitress multiple times to get water. not to mention, our waitress was not so coordinated  would drop items almost onto us. finally, the food was really not that great.  meh, i love the location and the idea, but i dont think well be coming back.
food and drinks are good but service is beyond slow, especially at the bar. youre a new business step it up and build your clientele! ugh i hate bad service!i cant even count how many times the bartenders made eye contact with me then just walked right by and proceeded to make servers drinks or polish glasses.
i was excited to try it out because of the location, theme, and outdoor space. however, i was weary because of the mixed reviews.  went on a friday night. they said it would be 20 min but it took about 10 so that was great. the patio has a really nice look and feel! i was excited! then we get to the bad: the service. it took the server about 1015 min to come take our drink order, took even longer to actually get the drinks. the water she said shed bring didnt come until we asked for it again halfway through our meal.  we ordered a cheese plate which was delicious and the drinks were just as good. too bad it would take forever every time we ordered a round. it took even longer to get our check and what seemed like an eternity to get our cards back to sign. with so many other options to chose from, why go back to a place where they dont respect their customers enough to provide efficient service?
everything on the menu is spicy! even if it doesnt say it! i struggled to find something to order to begin with and settled on the grilled salmon with veggies. i took one bite and that was the end of that. way too spicy. my boyfriend was nice enough to switch meals with me. he had ordered a burger. i took one bite of that and couldnt eat it either! too spicy! he agreed that both meals were spicy and he likes spicy food. the waiter was kind enough to offer me a menu to order something else, but i declined because i knew i wouldnt find anything else i cared for. we had no problem with the service. we were seated promptly and the waiter was attentive, always refilling our water glasses. the atmosphere is very cute and detailed with the school house theme. the menus, presentation of the dishes, and the plates themselves were very appealing and i wanted to take them home. however, it was way too loud in there. the room is extremely echoey to begin with, and they throw loud music and tv noise on top of that. i truly felt like i was back in a school cafeteria thats not a good thing.bottom line, i would not return.
average burger n fries. good beer choices. service people have good intentions, no exprience. my burgee was punched in as a different item ext4 and i never received the last beer order. waited 15 min. didnt wanna argue over the bill.  last beer wasnt charged just never received when the weather is nice, patio is worth it.
terrible service but good food.we werent helped for a solid ten minutes after we were seated.  we were a party of ten and everything  we ordered came out and different times. appetizers, salads, burgers and pizza all came out separately. half of us were done with our entrees while others still had not seen their appetizers! one person even got up and went to the bar to order drinks and grab us plates. we desperately needed waters filled, had no serving plates, no condiments and no server in sight. it was pretty disappointing and unfortunate for a group work lunch. the buffalo cauliflower tots were delicious and a healthy portion. crunchy breaded outside, and firm texture inside. the buffalo and blue cheese sauce served with them were also good.the bacon cheese tots were ok. the potatoes tasted a little raw to me and had a snap not usually found in a tot. the watermelon heirloom tomato salad was great. charred watermelon, huge slices of tomatoes and a balsamic reduction.the other people in my party also complimented the food but said they would not return because of the poor service. sorry public i guess school is out for more than the summer.
went back on a saturday afternoon for a drink and some appetizers. service was not good. we mustve asked four different people for water before we finally got it. it wasnt busy at all. bartenders seemed oblivious. they seemed more concerned about shift change  cleaning up than their patrons. i give it two stars because the food was good.
we tried a wide range of items from the menu, and nothing stood out at all. youll notice that most of these reviews are about the staff and decor  and yes, the service was good, and the decor and theming is outstanding. its still a restaurant though, and the food sucked.we didnt try any of the cocktails though... maybe thats where they shine.
i dont think ive ever gotten on yelp to bash one of our local eateries, and while this isnt an outright bashing, wow, this was some really bad service.  our party of 8 was seated promptly but it was 15 minutes before our server approached and took drink orders. 15 minutes later, most of our drink orders arrived since they were out of what i ordered, i had to wait another 5 minutes.  the menu had some interesting items but was overall meh, and food took forever to arrive. some in our party commented on the plates that had been sitting under the heat lamps forever, turns out, it was ours. fish and chips sat easily for 20 minutes so the fries were soggy as one could imagine. my buddy asked for more ketchup, never arrived. we ordered an extra round of drinks and after 10 minutes, same friend went out to the bar to get them himself. while there, he ran into our server, which was a little awkward, and the server commented about the drinks, and ended up bringing the round we ordered anyway, so now we have an extra round on our table getting warm. at least we wont have to wait for the next round to arrive.  bottom line:  with all the options in downtown summerlin, a restaurant really needs to bring its a game. the soggy food and really bad service makes me regret suggesting it for our monthly get together. we wont be back.
they cant update the tap list online! the food combinations make you think the cook is like dr. frankinstein! get back to the basics the unique flavor combinations are horrible!
the customer service was horrible. we sat down at the bar and the bartender handed us a menu with half of the items that expired. i ended up getting a jack and coke and the bartender filled up the portion shot and ran out of jack while it was half filled and didnt bother opening a new bottle it was strictly coke. we sat down and received water out of a vase to distribute out for the table ourselves. after we received our second bottle we noticed a lot of food floating around in the bottle. we had already drank half of the bottle! we brought it up to the server and he responded let me get you another one. we expressed our disgust with what had happened and he said he would talk to his manager. once he returned with a clean bottle we asked what the manager said and he responded with he didnt say much. we were appalled! the manager then finally came by and asked what would you like me to do? it was like pulling teeth for good service. the only reason im not giving this one star is because they took 20 off the bill. over all the food was ok and the menu was confusing the entire table ordered the same thing. be careful.
too crowded.  not very good service from the servers and foods okay.  love the atmosphere though.
eh on service. ordered 3 appetizers, got them all separately. had to ask for napkins. ive had better service and better food but the drinks were good.
just opened 3weeks ago with limited menu like everyone said. only available poke was their shoyusupposedly their best from what the cashier said, very bland and disappointing. im kinda afraid to try the other style poke. i also had the fish jun which was the first time ive had it super greasy, fish was very thick and again, bland.  their sauce was also more on the shoyu jalapeno side which was new to me.   i hate to say but if you want poke go to island sushi just down the road. thank me later. still undecided if ill be back or not.
discovered this place while driving by. my fiance  ordered the chicken katsu and bbq chicken combo for 12.95. i ordered the lau lau plate. both plates came with side of kimchi, mac salad and rice. the portions are small. the bbq chicken came with one piece of chicken and the katsu had one piece as well. the lau lau was bland and there was not any pork fat my favorite part of lau lau. we are frequent customers to l n l and i was disciplined. the prices are higher and the amount of food is less. although the food was ok, the customer service was excellent.
went here cause i seen it on facebook. there was three of us. we started started off the spicy poke bowl, the fish was not sashimi grade. it was the darker bloodier part of the fish. or maybe we got the bottom of the bowl. i wasnt  impress. then we ordered two dishes. i had the fried noodles looked ono but most noodles was burnt and no flavor. my husband ordered the fish jun, he said it was just ok. the service was great though and the order was served expeditiously.
my husband and i ate there. it didnt knock my socks off! he ordered the meat jun and chicken katsu. he liked both and i like the katsu. i ordered the shoyu chicken. i was not impressed. it was more like a gravy! and the spicy ahi poke bowl was pretty skimpy on the ahi and generous on the rice.
not too big a fan of the poke. shoyu was insanely salty. spicy tuna wasnt good. they marinade the tuna with shoyu before mixing in with the spicy mayo. and it makes the tuna look brown which is displeasing.
the service was okay and the food was okay too. im a food lover and i always love to try new restaurants whenever i have time. i expected a lot from this hawaiian poke since i love poke. so i ordered poke shoyu today and i wasnt impressed. the price was reasonable i guess but i think they can do better with the taste.
poke was ok!loco moco was not what i was used to.  was greasy and a grey gravy  not brown.kalbi was prob the only thing i would order again.
that was shoyu chicken? it was probably the worst ive ever had. but the absolute worst part of our visit was the prices. seriously, this place is located in a strip mall, next to walmart and they have the nerve to charge what theyre charging??? especially when you take into account that the food doesnt even remotely taste like the food back home in hawaii. my daughter ordered a combo plate and i ordered the shoyu chicken. we had two drinks. our bill was almost 30. yes, i am serious.i was born and raised in hawaii so maybe im spoiled but to me the food was horrid. i gave it one more star than i should have because the girl at the counter, while pretty dense she forgot one of our orders, was exceptionally friendly.
got samples they gave us smaller than a penny sized for me and my boyfriend to share. shoyu poke was horrible, overly salty. the poke itself is not prepared right, very chewy. maybe the other items are much better but skip this place for their poke. fish tasted like it wasnt fresh
this place over priced..ordered the spicey poke and felt as if they are hiding the quality of fish with over saucing it..there are way better options..they will out price themselves out business  20 a pound
do not, i repeat, do not for the love of god, go here for poke. this was the worst poke i have ever tasted. even i make it better. 1 there were no sesame oil or sesame seeds and 2 while shit, all that damn salt thats in there!! its insane! it tastes nothing like how poke should taste. if you want good poke, go to island sushi. they have various types of poke to choose from. my bf ordered the shoyu poke plate and i ordered the bbq chicken with a 14lb side of limu poke. all that came out to 33. the only thing that was good was my bbq chicken. we had to throw the rest away. the poke made the bf sick that when we got home he passed out for a few hours. we will never come here again.
the wings are meh. bwws is better and thats not saying much. our waitress is a complete dingbat. orders took forever and one of my wings was pea sized. i will nit be back.
i had the 10 piece boneless which was cold and not very good. i took over an hour to get our food and place was almost empty. hopefully it was just a bad day. will give them another shot next week. hopefully i can give them more stars next time.
i love the location. but the service at the bar is horrible. the manager with niners jersey made feel better. but danielle and the other bartender with brunette hair on at that time  horrible bartenders. need a attitude readjustment. i ask for a beverage. and she seem to get upset for me asking. also never ask if we want water or a refill .  being a local to las vegas customers service is key. other then that i love watching games there.
i thought the food was mediocre ..first time eating here was a let down. i was excited to try it but their chicken they used for the boneless wings was dry.. and my quesadilla was something i could have made 10x better at home. not worth 40.. the waitress was nice though.
so the palms tore out a couple of restaurants and put in what is supposedly one of the largest or the largest? hooters restaurants. its open to the casino floor, but finding a way inside was actually difficult. we went to where the main welcome mat and sign were, but it was blocked off. after circling the entire place, on the opposite side, we found an entrance with a hostess stand. these ladies clearly did not like their jobs. every empty table in the area to which we were led was dirty. all them had been cleared of dishes. but there were lots of spots of food and sauce. not fun. we had to clean off our on table.our server was fine enough. somewhat attentive. definitely in a hurry to get us out of there. also didnt seem to like her job at all.there was bad rap music blaring. blaring! we could barely carry on a conversation sitting right next to each other without yelling. and it was late on a monday night. not like it was some hopping weekend party.the food took a rather long time to arrive. much longer than any of my other hooters experiences. longer than most other restaurant experiences period.the wings and fries were fine and just what i expected. the cheese sauce that came with the fries at this location was actually a spicy cheese sauce, not the regular one. it was good. we opted to try the triple dog dare wing sauce  supposedly their hottest sauce. it wasnt hot. and it was far too sweet for my liking. i think ill be sticking to the spicy garlic from now on.so in sum, food took longer than usual, but tasted as usual. but the ambiance and staff here definitely leave something to be desired. it was not a pleasant dining experience.
mediocre food, waitress forgot about us during pickup order, overpriced at 10 for ten wings. plus you have to walk through with the entire length of the palms to even get there.
this is supposedly the largest hooters in the world or something. its inside the palms hotel. its clean and easy to get to. but, being a hooters you can be assured that...1. the service sucks.2. the food sucks.we waited at the host stand for 10 mins before anyone even came out to greet us. the food order came wrong always happens at any hooters. and the food was borderline uneatable. the entire point of a hooters is for overweight middle aged men with a 500lb wife at home who would rather go play with the teenage hooters girls. no one really goes here for the food mind you.
my first order experience was good.  i just started replacing all of the blinds in my house.   i started with two.  the two in the dining room.  it was a bit shocking how much lighter these blinds were than the existing blinds i had purchased 15 years ago.  yes, they are thinner cheaper slats but they looked good and i loved the valance.  so, i went back to my order history to order four more of the exact same blind for my living room.  when i finally got around to installing them i discovered that even though i ordered the exact blind they came with a different valance.  when i wrote to the company asking for the valances to match i was told that i ordered without returns.  what?  i clicked the same product as the last time, how was i to know what a return was? i was told the valances would be an additional 12 per window.  this is for blinds that i only paid 40 each for initially and the other valance is no additional charge.  well since they have a 100 satisfaction guarantee i sent a response.  the bottom line is: either i pay 44 to take advantage of their satisfaction guarantee or 48 to purchase new valances.the 12 is per valance. if you would like to proceed down the exchange route, under our satisfaction guarantee, we can do that. please ship the valances back to our office at:select shops1910 s. stapley drsuite 137mesa, az 85204from there, there will be a 20.00 restocking fee that is not per valance, that is for all four and we can send out the new valances with returns. the cost of shipping on the new valances out will also be at your expense 24.00. i just assumed it would be cheaper and less time consuming to place the new order at 4ft rather than going through the hassle of sending them back. as a side note, i have a total of 37 blinds hanging in my house.  i have only replaced six.  i guess this business has not read the book.  customer satisfaction is worthless, customer loyalty is priceless.  it costs significantly more to attract new customers than it does to keep your existing ones.  the sad thing is i had already referred them to one friend that already placed a large order with them.  i will be sure to update her as well as anyone else that will listen to shop somewhere else.
i am updating my last review, as i have since been refunded for the service!
short answer: no. not worth it.long answer: newest cafe that opened very recently as in not even a week old located next to basilique notredame in a gorgeous building in old montreal. decor is straight from a magazine ad youd find in those home decor magazines. in a way, expect very clean and well lit shop. first floor is all counter seats, the stairs area is tables and counter seats while the upper floor 2nd floor is communal table and lounge area. thats where youll find the bathroom too.now, as for the coffee, thats why we are here for. well, its not great coffee but its not bad either. its low midrange average to ok. in term of flavor profile, its on par with the toi, moi et cafe and illy coffee of this world with slightly more flavor. where it gets iffy and downright insulting is the asking price. it is the priciest of coffee ive had. pricier than the priciest 3rd wave while not remotely close to it in term of taste and flavor.i got my usual cappuccino. here, they offer 2 sizes, a small and a large. the small is cortado size or italian cappuccino size while the large would be your regular size cappuccino. i got the small as it was already pricey. price wise, the small is about 11.50 pricier than a cortado or about 2 pricier than an italian cappuccino. the large is about 1.50 pricier than the priciest cappuccino out there. thats taking into account tax because yes, theres tax..as for baked goods, they are from hof kelsten so i wont review that as you can just look up hof kelsten page to see how good they are.aside from coffee and baked goods, theres the alcohol part of the cafe. it is after all a coffee shopcocktail bar lounge. since i was only there for coffee, theres no appreciation to be made for the alcohol part of the place.so, beautiful clean cut coffee place that, to me, is not worth it. when you get a choice of sizing for your cappuccino, something is already not right. may be back for drinks if im ever in the old montreal neighborhood..
very expensive. espresso is 3. cookies start at 3.50.the service leaves something to be desired. after being told it wont be long, i stood at the counter for five minutes while three employees idled behind it, before giving up and leaving the cafe. i have no idea why no one asked me what i wanted or offered to explain the delay.the space and its decor are beautiful.very poor first impression, though. i dont really want to go back.
service was very disappointing. coffee was not bad, but still expensive for what we got. we were told after we had bought and been served our coffee that they were closing early for a special event.
la bouffe etait tres bonne! mais rien a boire de froid... ni leau, ni la liqueur et pas moyen davoir de la glace. sans meme nous demander si nous voulions autre chose, la serveuse nous a proposee de passer a la caisse. si nous avions envie dessayer lun de leur dessert compose de bacon, nous y avons repense 2 fois. pour ensuite se dire mmm... une tarte au sucre au bacon il fait essayer ca! mais malheureusement il y en avait pas. ma note est de 2.5.
i work near this place and wanted to try a somewhere that delivers since obviously i can not leave. im a bartender and i order delivery several times a week for myself and customers. so i called  the guy who answers was nice i ordered chicken pad no peanuts  and steam veggies and egg rolls. he tells me its 17 whatever dollars that is not enough there is a 25 minimum. ok...i explain to him that just yesterday one of his competitors just screwed me because they forgot the sauces  the vegetables were soggy etc. so i was looking for a new place who wants my business. hes says exactly this i really dont know what to do there is a  25 minimum isnt there something else you want? i laughed and went along with it.  they should of waived a few buck minimum to gain a new customer  so i ordered ragoons. which were very tasty. i again said no peanuts extra spicy 10 hot mustard and soy sauce etc. gave the address blah blah blah. .. before i hung up i said for the 3rd time remember the hot mustard. guess what 40 minutes later the driver walks in and i said i sure hope you didnt forget the hot mustard he had a dumbfounded look on his face we opened the bag theres no hot mustard no soy sauce no chopsticks. yes a fork and things labeled nicely. but really? why in hell is this so difficult? to me its a no brainer especially when i begged and pleaded reminded loudly. the driver says oh?.i asked if he is going to bring me some back he said yes i suggested he could just walk across the street to the other restaurant and get the sauces  from them and bring it back to save him a trip, but he said no he would come back.. he never came back. so needless to say im still looking for a delivery place with customer service!
how do you suck all the flavor out of a baby carrots? a question asked to me by my wife.  this simple question sums up my experience at cafe 6.  with the exception of the chips that came with the fried pickles the food was only noteworthy for its blandness.  the service was very good and the beer selection though minimal was excellent.
two stars. i would have rather have gone to bachi burger for the price. we waited about 30 minutes for our burgers to come out. i asked for a medium rare and it came more medium to well. my boyfriend made a custom burger with roasted poblano pepper, pork belly, pepper jack cheese and cajon mayo and it cam out with a portobello mushroom... no pork belly and no poblano pepper. when the waiter tried to go over the order with him, he kept saying so if i bring out pork belly, we should be good? no... he didnt want the mushroom and my boyfriend even pointed to the ingredients he asked for. the waiter took the burger back to the kitchen, while my boyfriend thought he was going to get a fresh burger with what he asked for... and the waiter came back out about 5 mins later with the same burger... the poblano and under cooked pork belly was on it and the mushroom still remained. thankfully hes not allergic to mushrooms. then we waiting 20 mins for our change, which you could see the waiter with his phones flash light trying to calculate the change from 100.00 bill. i will pass on coming here again and would not recommend it. presentation was nice but lacking in service and taste.
confused why they have 5 stars, but oh well. we came here after we checked into the palms place and were disappointed with the food. the service, however, was fantastic. our server was amazing and definitely went the extra mile to take care of us. he was really excited and kept the energy high even though we were both incredibly tired. we ordered the rock shrimp appetizer, i ordered a build your own turkey burger, he ordered their smokeout which is apparently what they are known for and we also had the sweet potato and skinny fries. the shrimp appetizer was okay. it wasnt great or absolutely terrible. i think the batter could have been a little better and fried a little longer, and i dont think they should toss it in the tobasco ranch. i love tobasco, however it made it really soggy. this was probably the best thing we ordered. my turkey burger was really bland. i got the normal toppings on it lettuce, tomato, onions and added mushrooms. they put way too many onions on there and it was an overwhelming taste. usually i dont complain about that because i do like onions, but they must have given me half of an onion. the smokeout looked unappetizing and he said he was really unhappy with it. i didnt even want to try it. the sweet potato fries were pretty good but a tad too salty. we didnt come back here, although we would have if the food was good. its convenient if you want something basic...like fries. i dont recommend this place.
my wife and i stayed at the palms recently while attending a friends event. this particular hotel is home to a few fairly wellregarded restaurants. when we arrived, however, it was lunchtime and so the n9ne steakhouse and nove italiano restaurants were not open. i asked the lady at the concierge desk where a good place for lunch would be. she suggested cafe 6 on the 6th floor at palms place. i stated that we were not in the mood for bar food. her reaction was priceless! she stiffened a bit and looked as if i had spat in her face. sir, cafe 6 does not serve bar food. it serves gourmet sandwiches; the very ones you see in these posters, pointing to a cafe 6 advertisement poster.so we went there and tried it. unfortunately, it actually was bar food, and not very good bar food at that. if i had been in the mood for that, i might have enjoyed it a bit more.my wife got a turkey dinner which was a turkey burger with avocado on a taro bun. you will know the taro bun by its deep purple color and horrifying taste. also, her burger was undercooked and we had to send it back.i got the build your own burger, but you cant erect a mansion with clay and old 2x4s. despite looking pretty good, it was just...not. in addition, my burger was also undercooked and had to be sent back as well. the accompanying fries were salty, greasy and largely inedible.yes, virginia, it is bar food.
so for those of you in the know, this was east side marios and then it was badda bing. when it changed to badda bing it had the esm menu which i loved. feed me bread and salad all day everyday and im happy! i told my husband i wanted to go to have the unlimited salad and soup. he told me it wasnt esm and i said i know...i wish i would have known it wasnt even bb anymore.the entire menu had nothing appealing to me. my hi and tried the osso bucco and it was bland. the meal came with some kind of rice dish which was bland. he asked to switch for pasta on the side and that was less than impressive.i had a cheese pizza and it was okay. the wood burning pizza oven gives a nice crisp crust which was great. we had this amazing dessert with nutella and lemon. yummy.i dont know if the food was bad, bland, or boring or if i was just upset they didnt have my salad but i didnt like anything but that dessert.i would recommend the bar side for those of you who are into beer. they have like 30 beers on tap.
very disorganized in the morning unlike other einsteins they lack organization. its not a quick in and out in the morning
service approximatif et lent quoique souriant. gerant un peu agressif a refuse lacces a la terrasse pour notre groupe de 8. longlet commande a ete servi cru et a du etre retourne pour deux convives a notre table. un peu cher pour une prestation inegale et somme toute tres moyenne.
i so wanted to love les fillettes, so much so that i will give it another try sometime, but i have to give it 2 stars after my dining experience today at lunch.first of all, the good about this place: the staff is attentive and really knows their wine listpairings. the half liter option for wine is nice and it comes in a classy, plain bottle. theyve got quite the range and the prices were pretty good as well; second, the staff is positively lovely. our server changed midservice, unannounced, for some reason even though the place wasnt even busy, but both were great. third and last, the place itself. the renovations inside are fantastic and this terrasse is truly a hidden gem of a terrasse: leafy, shaded and quiet even though this restaurant is located right on the busy van horne.ok, so the bad: the food was bland and not especially edible. started off with the milk and cauliflower soup as a starter; it was a cold soup and quite refreshing, but it was so bland and really needed something else to kick it up a notch. for the main, we both had their take on calamari. i quite like it when calamari isnt fried, so when it arrived on a bed of lentils and veggies and with no batter in sight, i was happy, but it looked like a stuffed, pink slug, not very appetizing looking. i tucked into my dish and although it wasnt the worst thing ive ever tasted, it was bad, both my lunch mate and i left at least half of the food on our plates if you know me, you know that this isnt normal! the table beside us ordered steak and they returned their lunch back to the kitchen, so i know that it wasnt just our dish that was off today.the dessert was equally bland, it was a cherry clafoutis served in a cute round, shallow dish. it looked so pretty, but the consistency was mushy and it tasted like nothing.the terrasse, the wine and the cold mint drink that came with dessert were the best parts of this whole experience and i want to like this place as its so hip and friendly and has a fantabulous terrasse, but they are going to need to work on the food, especially in a city like ours and for the price that they are charging as well.
i agree with what charles g. said. its friday, weve been here since monday. ...pack a lunch.
i love chipotle and have gone to many in the valley. i understand that this one just opened and have been here 3 times, but this last time was horrendous. 1i wanted a veggie bowl splitill pay extra no worries and the lady looked at me like i was asking something impossible. on top of that there was not even enough veggie left to add to a meat burrito let alone be a half of a veggie burrito and the veggies looked like they had been there for a while. no worries i will wait. 2i asked for a kids cheese quesadilla. the lady left it on so long not only did it look burnt but it was rock hard! i gave it back to her and said no thank you and she threw it in the garbage and walked off even though i was at the register paying for it. 3after the manager ran up to me apologizing and making a new quesadilla i paid for chips with my meal and was just so ready to get out of there that i didnt realize i hadnt been given my chips either.....they really need to train their staff better. this gives chipotle a completely bad name!!!!
i want to give this chipotle a good review, i really do...but i just cant. i love chipotle and eat there once a week. the food quality is ok. seems a bit lacking compared to other locations, but what is seriously lacking is service efficiency. since theyve opened midmay, ive probably been there 6 times. every single time, i have had to wait extra for something they ran out of and didnt have a new batch ready. i did get my meal free once because of this without me asking, which was nice. maybe its because theyre new i hope thats the case, but its been a consistent thing that makes me want to drive farther to visit another location...
i dont normally even make comments...but this place needs work. i went there today because i got a gift card and figured id enjoy some chipotle for lunch as i often do. i noticed this one was really close to my apartment, less than a mile. i asked for a chicken burrito to go, and when i got home, which only takes about 2 minutes, my burrito was cold. normally the chicken,beans and rice are hot and the only thing cold is the cheese and sour cream. the chicken tasted burnt and as if it had been sitting out all day. also, the young lady who made my burrito, although very nice, ripped it on both ends and said be careful its ripped on both sides without offering to rewrap it or make a new one. i got home and put it in a bowl because it just fell apart. i might give this place one more chance because its so close to my apartment, but i sure hope this was a one time deal.
weak coffee and weak bloody marys are a little pricey for being half price of 5. if you want your eggs your way dont come here. service was poor but but the food was not bad to make it 2.5 stars.
cheap drink specials, and tasty margaritas but this place is not for me.  im not into fog machines, laser lights, way too loud club music and a bass beat that made my head throb.  im not a fossil, but certainly way too old for this place. tablemade guacamole had way to much onion in it but the chips and salsa were decent.  pretty bland chicken quesadilla.
so this place was ran out of late night servers. my group of 7 had to order at the bar. then once i ordered the menu switched to the late night.  l opted for a shrimp salad
i just left this resteraunt  for the 2nd time for the same meal.  so upset i did a call in order for  pickup the meal was 2 chicken  liver and gizzard dinners went to pickup meal and bring home the upsetting  part was i was missing my gizzards.  i called back and was told i did not say gizzards  but, bring back meal.  so i am upset no apology  and when i get there is was told i had to pay 85cents more.  now after using my 85cents in gas to go back for a corrected meal i could not get over them asking for more money which i paid and decided  i would never go there again
wow...theater was like a sauna. was crowded and a lot of people were being kind of rude by asking me to move because i was sitting by myself. i moved twice and a woman asked me if i could have my seat again. the movie had already started. it was jurassic world. this is the highest grossing moving for opening weekend of all time and you show up late and wonder why you cant find a good seat? sorry lady. no sympathy. you were by yourself so theres no reason you were late, either. plus, the two tweakers that tried to act coy to squeeze me out of the handicapped when, at first, i thought they were also handicapped but they were just tweakers. the girl could not sit still and was constantly shifting around and putting her feet up. i dont know, maybe she was handicapped but looking closer it didnt really seem like it. of all the times that the usher comes through with the annoying light to do a head count that always seems like the most disruptiveimportant part of the movie and this day they decide to skip checking? ugh. was still a good movie in spite of the balmy theater with weird smells and rude people. i remember when i would always wear pants to theaters because its always cold. not this one. 18 dollars should have a little better air conditioning. not happy.
be sure to take some ear plugs or cotton to stuff in your ears because the imax theater has head crushing sound. the theaters arent cleaned very well and smell funny. the box office has nice smiling young women. but after that, get ready for indifference and slow service. good news, its mostly clean, modern, has working seats and armrests, and has acceptably competent staff.
i think this is what happens when a bar owner with emo leanings watches too much game of thrones and thinks the wall  now theres a theme for a bar!everything is black and theres what i assume are meant to be fake wolf pelts on the seats. the food is soso. we had the burger and the mac n cheese, and while wolf  water gets points for serving its pulled pork hotter than the usual lukewarm gloop you seem to get elsewhere, nothing else on the plate was outstanding. sorry, not a plate. food comes on metal baking trays, which are an arse to eat from.alright selection of craft beers and cocktails, and wine by the glass is reasonably priced, but the choice feels limited compared to the big boys of craft beer in edinburgh. if you want to pretend youve taken the black and need a few beers to face the wildings and the walkers, this is your shout. but not for me.
i was quite disappointed with my visit to wolf and water. this establishment had recently been bond no.9.  the menu was limited and the food was not of the best quality. that said the staff were lovely and attentive. i would return there to meet friends for drinks but certainly not to eat. i hope the chef takes note and provides a more varied menu.
we were there yesterday and they have only been open a day.  that being said, wow it was hard to order and communicate.  the food barrier is too high and although the food servers are friendly, they struggle to hear you and remember what you said.  they need training on the menu.  i had a chicken taco and a potato taco.  the chicken taco was good but the potato was deep fried and came from the back, then sealed shut so you cant really add salsas and fresh toppings.  my bf got the meat torta and did not like it.  the meat had little flavor and it was packed with white rice??? and no guacamole; he was almost angry about a torta stuffed with rice.  we will try again because the menu was good and i think they are just experiencing newness with the staff.
still on soft opening, but still...the iced tea dispenser manual was out of order.  i ordered a chronic salad with the lime cilantro vinaigrette.  i got a handful of lettuce and some kind of nasty chicken....then i was asked if i wanted something else on it...huh?  so, i eyed a bunch of dispensers and asked for cilantro and onions.  all this for 7 bucks and change.  ugh.  they serve beer.  a customer was in there eating a burrito.  she said it was good.  i will give this place a wide berth for a while.  i will wander over to potbelly or chick fil a for my salads.  both are a few steps away.  oh...the tshirts were cool.  they will be available at some point.
a friend and i went there for lunch at work. the two girls behind the counter spent easily 5 minutes talking to each other before helping us. they had poor attitudes and were inexperienced. neither of us got what we requested even though it is similar to chipotle. the girl put onions on my burrito with out me asking then was upset i didnt want them. others at the tables next to me had the same experience. maybe with time it will get better. the food was so so. i would not go back.
i took my son to eat here for lunch.  they made it hard for him to order he is 7.  he couldnt really get any meat or melted cheese on his kids burro, so he got pinto beans and cold shredded cheese.  he would prefer taco bell.   i was 3rd in line and waited 20 minutes to order.   they forgot my taco and just seemed very disjointed.   honestly unless something changes, chipollte is just down the way and much more organized.   the manager was cool!  although i asked him for salsa for my son and it never came.
very slow service. had run out of pico de gallo... who runs out of pico??? mexicanspanish rice wasnt cooked all the way through and was al dente. food was eh definitely did not meet the hype that was built up.
not impressed. talked to brad  he promised the issues i had with food handling etc. would be rectified. well see...
been here twice now and i must say im disappointed.  the first time i visited was for lunch and the line was so long, waiting over 30 minutes in line just to order, seemed a bit unorganized, but i chalked it up to being brand new.  second time was even worse.  waiting in line way too long again,  things go so chaotic as far as who ordered what as some things must be ordered from the kitchen, which means you are waiting longer than a person behind you....staff doesnt know who ordered what.  utter chaos.  i probably will not be back, even though the food is really good, i cant deal with the chaos.  the food line was also really dirty yesterday, and i saw an employee take a huge scoop of something out of the salsa and throw it in the trash, and then use that same salsa to dress tacos.  no thanks.
overpriced, underseasoned 6.25 for a basic cheese quesadillasteak was grissly and greasy with no seasonings we gave it a try but wont retun, chipotle is just across the parking lot.
i always want to come by to have a nice taco break but talk about depressing when you walk through the doors. i understand when you work; youre tired and grumpy but you dont show it to people you work around. the employees seem depressed and not in a decent mood to work and the music around them is in a happier mood than them, i sometimes feel like i shouldnt order anything! beyond customer service, the food is 45 stars. a bit salty but still nice to eat.maybe its time for new employees or some fun ways to keep them happy?
decor has a cute dia de los muertos v modern urban feel. seating is comfortable.  pretty good draft and bottled beer options.  i tried an al pastor and a carnitas taco. both were too greasy but were seasoned ok. but they were a big disappointment because both the corn tortillas and meat filling were cold. i hope i dont get food poisoning from the under temp meat. it might have been hot when they scooped it onto my plate, but had gone cold by the time i paid and sat down. this is even though there was only one person ahead of me in line. they had 2 assembly line workers during lunch rush  just not effective to move the line fast enough. it only got worse after i made it through the line. and staff were initially friendly but showed their stress as they got more and more overwhelmed. tables werent being wiped down either, so you had to clean a place to sit down. if you come in and see only 2 people working, walk out and go somewhere else.
not the worst tacos ever, but theres just something not quite right about the flavors. wont be eating here again.
tastepriceno soda.. id pass, theres a place next door better. chronic tacos is to chipotle but with tacos. the place just opened at 10 am and the meat in my chicken and steak taco is cold. the flavor and price are ok but theres more exciting places right here. im throwing away one of my tacos and i bought a soda they were out of every kind i drink in the machine. i was given a bottle of coke and its expired, so its flat. it was a waste of gas driving up here there is a  taco bell right next to my school. lunch no bueno today
food handling by the employees appears to be acceptable now. the dude with the giant ass beard is now wearing a beardnet  i dont see employees eating on the line or keeping their drinks in view of customers anymore. the wait times suck! usually theres only 2 people on the food line, including the cashier. there should be more food assembly line workers, especially during lunch rush hour.
why close far before your listed hours? so frustrating....they have a sign on their door that clearly says new hours monthur until 9 pm, frisat until 10pm and sunday until 8pm. we showed up at 8:15 pm on a monday and all the lights are off, chairs stacked on tables, totally closed. we like the food but if you are unreliable and dont even stay open during your listed hours its so frustrating and unfortunate. weve been more patient about other shortcomings other people have mentioned that we have also experienced mopey employees, soda machine being out, cleanliness issues because there are always going to be growing pangs and a learning process with any new place, but at this point it just seems like bad business practices, especially for a newer establishment.
got a shrimp taco from here to go, it tasted alright.. well i figured it could be an alternative to chipotle which is why i went here and i was a bit disappointed. the service was ok, seemed like it could have been quicker but honestly the taco i got was tiny and it was like 45? kind of skimping on ingredients and overcharging. i also got the quesadilla which was pretty good but still i would recommend chipotle over this place.
with a name like chronic tacos, youd think this place would serve some bomb tacos, they dont. they should change the name to seedy brick weed tacos. nothing was fresh, tortillas were cold, tacos are way over priced and the staff was poorly trained. management here must be non existent, no one knows what the other person is doing and there is no type of order at all. had high expectations that were quickly let down.
first time to jm. service was slow. waited 10 to place order as the person who writes order also sliced the meat and made the sub. there were other workers standing there and when they made the sub was very slow. i dont know how they handle lunch crowd. sub bread was to hard for my taste. very expensive compare to subway and smaller and sloppy. will visit another location in town. maybe it was a maricopa moment as im finding things are done different here.
first, i love love love their philly cheese steak. thats all i get and the hubs gets the big kahuna. we started going when they first opened and went once a week until recently. there have been some staff issues but most of the time they were working hard and friendly. hubs always orders and pays for double meat. double meat was just what it sounds like, and what we expected. well, last week he went in and the girl who made his sandwich took the portioned out meat and cut it in half. when he questioned her, she identified herself as the manager. he asked since when because hed been in there more than 20 times and never saw her before. he explained theyd always gave him double, not 1.5. she wanted to know who, he said everyone and described the one he had understood to be the manager. she said that guy was the regional manager, which would make him her boss. she said she was going to talk to him because he was doing it wrong. seems strange to me but the hubs was very upset and swears he wont go back unless he gets what hes been getting. i did love the that cheese steak! bread could be better.
sub was good, but my god the process is infuriating.  not sure why they make the entire customer lines subs at the same time, but they need to learn efficiency.  terrible process to make a sub.  took 10 minutes.
my first appt was great! i arrived 15 min early as requested to fill out paperwork but i had already done it online. they did the usual blood work, ultrasound and urine test. quick and friendly.my 13 week checkup came and i ended up doing the same again. blood and urine tests. waited about 30 minutes in the room. dr steps in to ask if i have any questions.  nope im fine dr. said we can find out the sex of the baby by 16 weeks so on your next apt we can find out. every mothers most exciting moment. i was so eager to make it down for my 17weeks appt to see baby. i waited an hour and a half they took me into a room where i waited another 25 minutes. they advised me no one was there to do blood work so advised me to get it done somewhere else. dr said any complications i said no. she says you can do this blood work blah blah and your next apt you will do blood work again and do an ultrasound to find the sex of the baby  how much blood do i need to draw and i thought i was going to see the baby at this apt then that was it. i basically waited that long for them to ask me if everything was ok and send me on my way. hopefully i dont have to pay for this visit or ill be really pissed.today i decided to give it another try. i arrived really early cause i had no where else to go after work. it was me and 2 other patients i understand im early and dont mind waiting til my actual appt time. so to kill time i went in to their restroom and did a urine test since im waiting. the office was quiet you could here the nurses around the corner talking about starbucks. grande and trenta sizes. my apt. time came and everyones names were being called except mines. my 6yr old was getting restless but i tried to calm him down to be patient. 415 came and im back waiting again for my appt. by 430 i couldnt wait any longer so i walked out no one to tell at the desk. i got a call around 450 with a voicemail saying they were looking for me and would hate to have to call my emergency contact. so that means i probably wouldnt have gone in til 445. i called back to tell them i left but no one answered and i was on hold for 2 minutes so i hung up. i guess no matter what theres always a wait here.other than that, dr mchale is very nice and everyone is nice there. my last ob in hawaii would have us waiting for 2 hours but i didnt mind because they would inform us that hes actually at the hospital for a delivery. but when youre there feeling like you are waiting for nothing especially when pregnant and with a bored restless child it is not worth it. i think like all on offices they over book themselves and dont schedule time accordingly. now im in search of another ob to give someone else a try.
reviews must be friendsfamily. sat down not seated waited 5min or so to be greated. server approaches and takes drink order. returns a few minutes later and asks if we want menus. so, at this point we have now been seated for 810 min and have yet to see a menu. no big, can move on. get menus printed on xerox paper and stapled together and begin to order food. server informs they are out of carne asada. no big, can move on. so i ask about the shredded beef and chicken. server response, they are plain.... really, plain? ok, move on. order tacos. they literally take at least 30 min. its not busy by the way. oh, and the entire time theres karaoke... like we are supposed to have a taco in one hand and a microphone in the other.. so, listen to terribleterribly loud music while waiting for food. tacos come, aaaand they are not even average. why did it take 30 min for tacos with basically cold meat and cold tortillas? just dont get it. anyway, check comes. for what we got, def over priced. grabbing a 6 pack and taco bell before coming back.
had a less than okay experience. in the past we order chicken faijitas and are pleased. tried two other dishes and neither of us liked our meals. one waitress for entire restaurant, harried and abrupt at that. agree with another reviewer that the restaurant could use a good cleaning and sprucing up. kind of worn and shabby look. not eager to go back.
first, the good. i like the decor and the layout of the restaurant. it seemed clean and well thought out.now the notsogoods  the food is way over the top spicy. ive had new mexican food before and i loved it. using various chilies to enhance the flavor of traditional mexican dishes is a brilliant thing when done well. in the case of chile addiction, i dont think the cook knows the difference between flavor and just plain overspicing. to add to the insult of food so hot that you can no longer taste the other ingredients, when my wife asked our server how the chicken in her dish was prepared prior to ordering, his response was ummm.... well... its kind of braised... umm ... you know which didnt really mean much. being of mexican descent, my wife eats super spicy food pretty regularly and she couldnt finish her meal either. :anyway, in our party of five only one of us finished our meal and even she said she could only taste chilipeppers and black ground pepper. why would anyone want to eat enchiladas or chimichangas where you cant taste meat, cheese, or other ingredients??also, the spanish rice was soft and mushy and the refried beans were goopy and stiff and as if from a can. darn it! i really wanted to like this place.
went here tonight for dinner around 8pm it was slow we were sat right down and asked for drink orders ...... then we sat and sat and sat till i asked for our c hips n salsa we ordered guac as an app wich was tinny and flavorless the salsa was crazy spicy with no option for something more mild i ordered the chimichanga with pulled chicken again bland no flavor and the verde sauce was so damn spicy it ruined the whole thing my other half got the fajitas how can u mess that up right ??? well they did  they were ordered with no peppers extra onions and double rice they came out with no onions  extra peppers ...we told the waitress and she got new ones brought out however they came with no sizzle both times and we never got the rice at all like i mean the whole time ..... ya so its nasty over spicy and bad service  never returning sad that i waisted 45 bucks here and barley ate our food  ... oh and i almost forgot our daughter said her hot dog was nasty .... she eats hot dogs everyday how  can u make a hot dog nasty !!!!!update ..... woke up the next morning sick as a dog vomit and the runs :
the food was under seasoned and watery which i thought strange for a new mexican style restaurant. the service was bad too. we are not coming back!
the service was good.the place was clean and nicely decorated, except it was freezing in there when we went.i did not like how addiction is glamorized, or made funny, or cute on the menu. im not sure what the purpose of this is, and for which target group.besides the sopapillas and the salsa, i was not excited about the food.
im sad to have to give this a bad review because i really wanted to like it. the service is so slow and unpleasant here, which doesnt make any sense as a new restaurant. it makes sense to still be getting it together, but when theres multiple tables looking visibly annoyed, you need to be at least a little apologetic when it takes 15 minutes to even have your order taken or 90 minutes to get through a meal.i will say that the queso and the green sauce are good, but it everything else was shockingly bad. started out strong with fries with queso and green chile, but the burrito was awful. the red sauce is terrible, the calabacitas are bad and the rice is practically mashed potato consistency. it came out completely cold, but no one ever appeared to tell them about it so we were out of luck there. i might give it one more try and order something else and stick to green chile, but if i feel like im bothering the employees by even existing then itll be a loss.
new mexico style mexican food?!? ive never had that, i needs to go to there! and so there i went. brighteyed and bushytailed declaring this a food adventure. especially seeing this place so highly rated on yelp... again, dont believe the hype.this was a major food fail for the most part. first and foremost, it took about 10 minutes for someone to come by and say hi and take our drink order. chips and salsa arrived shortly after. the salsa was a bit spicy, which i liked, but my dad and sister dont do spicy, so they only had a quick taste before tapping out.i ordered a cup of pozole. it was delicious, heavy on the hominy which mama likes, and was presented in a large bowl and tasted homemade. my little sister ordered a carne asada burrito, refried beans, and rice. i had the stacked enchiladas with carne adovada with calabacitas and whole pinto beans. my dad opted for a combo with a beef enchilada, chile rellano, and a carne asada taco. we also got a side of sopapillas which werent touched. when the order came out, my dads taco was mia. the taco appeared like 20 minutes later and we declined it, they offered to let us take it home, and i did with my left overs.so lets talk about the food. it was bland and kind of boring. i was expecting more exciting flavors! new flavors, but everything fell flat. the only stand out dish at dinner was the chile rellano. it was the dankest of the dank and probably the best one ive ever had, but a chile rellano does not a 5star review make.thanks to yelp, we got a free fried ice cream as we looked over the check. fried ice cream was great, but it wasnt anything i hadnt had before.chile addiction didnt leave me with even a craving or much to remember them by. i really wanted to like this place. i really want little independent places to make it! i really root for the underdog! i just cant give them more than 2stars. poor service with less than mediocre food. im chopping it up to rookie mistakes. will venture back, but very underwhelmed thats the opposite of overwhelmed, right?.
two stars because if youre going to do new mexican cuisine it better be good. we are in the southwest and we expect better than this.i had the burger because i love green chile cheeseburgers. the good: meat was flavorful and a good size. cheese was melts. bread was better than a regular bun you get when you give up and order a burger at a restaurant. spicy. the bad: fries were really sad looking, flavorless and undercooked. guacamole was meh. salsa tastes like stores bought salsa with a few chopped up chiles thrown in. beans definitely came from a can.i would have enjoyed my meal much better if i only ate the burger. it was pretty good. 4.2 out of 5. everything else was so underwhelming that it dragged my entire experience way down.
im not quite sure what the hype is all about here. we came here for lunch, i got an enchilada and a taco. we constantly had to ask for more salsa, they serve it in these little containers and after two chips its gone, it got to the point where we specifically had to ask for a bigger container. 5 people and a 4 oz plastic container of salsa just didnt cut it. the food came out luke warm and i have to admit i was not impressed. i kid you not the taco shells honestly tasted like the store bought old el paso taco shells. with all the other authentic mexican restaurants in the valley, i think i personally would pass up coming here again. they have a great concept just didnt deliver for our group on the meal
im from new mexico and maybe i was hoping that it would be like the new mexican food i am used to.  i had the frito pie which is a new mexico staple.  i found it a little strange that the ground beef was not cooked in the red chile.   i understand that they try and cater to everyone including vegetarians but it seemed like there wasnt enough chile on the dish so it seemed a little dry.  i will say that the sopapillas are delicious.  i will give it another try to see if i can find something on the menu to remind me of home.
kinda sad now. i ordered huevos rancheros smothered green and i got a plate full of beans pretty much with green chili thrown on top of the beans and eggs on top of that. they said that they dont do the green chili sauce. how can you call yourself a nm restaurant with no green chili sauce?  looks like i will be taking the drive to carlitos from now on!!
had high hopes for authentic new mexican food but was terribly disappointed. atmosphere is great and loved all of the new mexican decor.... sadly the food had zero flavor and tasted premade.
this is gonna hurt me more than its gonna hurt you.having grown up in albuquerque and santa fe and having a true love for new mexican cuisine, as well as knowing how to cook new mexican cuisine, imagine my absolute delight that someone had decided to open a new mexican food restaurant in vegas apart from carlitos burritos.  which, by the way, is a smash hit 5 star place.. and the nevada governors fave place to visit when in town, i know, i was there when he said it himself, but i digress... 1 star for having the huevos to open up such a restaurant 2 stars for the beautiful southwest decor, complete with an rc gorman print on the wall... regretfully that is where i will leave it.  service was miserable.  not a crowded afternoon, it was aarp  toddler hour.   took forever to seat us and there were more than enough open seats.  once seated, we counted 18 minutes until someone came to our table.  that was after my husband had to flag someone down.  these are the basics, people.  once we did order it was an eternity to actually get our food.  carne adovada was super dry and not worth a third bite.  the pork chile verde was loaded with large potatoes, no hatch green chile spice at all and one piece of pork.  really?  my husband and i were so disappointed.  i seriously have no words for the level of gross.  too bad, it would have been a huge hit for my family had it been better.
everything tasted the same but with different textures. i probably wouldnt eat here again. i ordered to go and gave the guy on the phone an approximate time. i show up  and they didnt even have it ready. i had to wait an extra 15 mins.
neat and clean with an industrial warehouse decor.  starbucks coffee but not starbuckslaboulange food.  underfruited greek strawberry blueberry yogurt parfait lacked fruit and cost 5.79.  two stars only for the airport prices.
poor service. server had never heard of dogfish head 60min sat at host station for 5mins never got acknowledged even though there were 2 there talking, so i sat myself. good food.
not sure what all the hype on this place is about... the ambiance is decent, ill give them that. but the food was not good at all. maybe we just got the wrong things? when i asked for recommendations from our server she gave us short, uneducated answers and had a bit of an attitude. chicken fingers were about the same quality as the frozen ones at the grocery store.. i asked for ranch to hide the taste a bit and waited ten minutes for someone not even our server to bring it. only to find out later that we were charged for it! we also got a french dip with au jus. both the sandwich and dip were waaayyy to salty to eat. disgusting. atmosphere: 45. decent patio, new building. service: 15. server did the bare minimum. also should have warned us that they charge for ranchextra sauce.. ive always been warned by servers at places that do that. food: 15. chicken strips were edible but barely, french dip was beyond disgusting. i might go again to try the burgers that everyone loves so much and give the place another shot, given that its so close to my place, but my first experience was not good at all.
3rd visit and it waste worst visit. a wednesday night big crowd for pre 6 oclock and they were overwhelmed at the bar. wrong orders , no drinks and generally slow service. and this is during the slow summer , hate to see the winter snow bird season
i ate here with my girlfriends tonight and we were very disappointed. not sure if they were having an off night but one of the orders with chicken in the name was missing the chicken. i sent back to the kitchen and then they left off another key ingredient the second time around. my girlfriends meal had a hair in the food and she was immediately done! the manager came around to make things right promising to comp those two meals. i assured him i didnt need that but he insisted. i was very impressed by his tenacity to make things right, but sure enough the bill comes around and all of our food is on there. he did nothing to relay the message apparently. it just puts a bad taste in my mouth with the manager promising one thing but not actually going through with it. the location in old town scottsdale is 10 times busier but also gets my order right every time.
been there twice. music was so loud i had to shout across the table at my guests. burgers were puppy chow. undercooked and small. goodby burgers and barf!
first of all i rarely do negative reviews as i have a high tolerance for slow or bad service when the food is good. but i feel i have to and only hope that the service will improve at the shea location. i have not been to the other locations so i cant comment on the service at those locations. food i rate a 4, service 0 stars. service is hit or miss. more miss than anything. used to come here once a week but we are going to wait until service improves. food is good when made as ordered, however the last several times i ordered build your own burger it was missing one or two things i had on the list, like mayo or sauteed onions. if you are missing something like a condiment dont expect to ever get it or plan on asking someone else.  from my experience make sure to order when someone is in front of you or you will have a long wait.  i really hope service improves so i can go back.
this was my first time at this location. pretty disappointed. i really wanted to like this place since hearing some friends talk about it. they missed 2 toppings on my burger and missed 1 topping on another in our party. one burger came out cold, so they took it back to put it back on the grill. it came back out as the rest of the group was either done with their meals or close to it. lastly, all 5 burgers were ordered medium rare, and all came out medium well. almost no pink at all.after the food was brought out, our waitress walked by 3 times without checking on us. she finally saw us waving her down and she came over to correct our meals, bring out missing items, etc.the manager did comp the meal that had to be reheated. overall, i would go back again maybe another location, but probably not on my own accord.
located in ballys hotel  casino. connected to the bucca di peppo chain, but not the completely same set up. here you have an option of menu items servings for 1 and not family style or their buffet. my husband chose off the menu and rather enjoyed his meal. i, on the other hand, chose the buffet. the buffet had a mediocre selection of foods and some of the supposed hot items were cold. they had extra sauces, but not within reach of the diner. when i wanted sauce there was no one to get it for me. i waited and waited, until i tried to get it myself. well that got their attention and finally someone came to my aid, but it was still warm sauce on cold pasta. our waiter was great. so if you do chose to dine here, i suggest selecting from the menu only, as you will waste your money on the buffet.
been in vegas for a week and this place has been the worst. waited 1015 min to be seated in an almost completely empty restaurant. came for the breakfast buffet. most of the food was barely hot or fresh for my first plate. second plate was not so bad. coffee was terrible. took one sip and left the rest. had to get up and ask for water. got the water with no straw. no one ever picked up dirty dishes and was asked if everything was ok right before they brought the check.
i wish i could say i liked this place, but....its just not that good. came here with a friend and ordered a mango lassi along with a chicken madras and a chicken kadai. neither were very memorable, in my opinion. the chicken madras was incredibly heavy on the coconut sauce and contained very little flavor other than coconut. on the other hand, the chicken kadai was better, however, it lacked chicken and was heavy on the onions and peppers. the mango lassi however, was quite good. it had the perfect amount of sweetness and thickness that i prefer in a lassi and the amount given was more than enough in the best way possible!. because the lassi was so darn filling, i couldnt finish my chicken madras so i asked the waiter to give me a togo box. the first togo box i received was broken, so i asked for another. turns out, this one was broken too. all subsequent togo boxes were broken, according to the waiter. really?! how do you not knowsee this? i wasted a lot of food just by having to transfer my leftovers not once, not twice, but three times. the third togo container was just too small to fit my leftovers!as far as prices go, this place was pricey for a notsolarge portion where there was just too little chicken or too much coconut milk. service was...okay. the waiter seemed indifferent and bored. not all excited, which was strange since the place had been open for only a day and we were the only customers in sight. bottom line, i wont be eating here again, the food here was not memorable. there are plenty of other indians spots around oakland which i would highly recommend over this one.
what a huge disappointment. ive eaten at kneaders in other states and had a positive experience so im surprised i had such an awful experience top to bottom.first off, we were the only people in there. because of this, the place was spotless with every employee in there bored and cleaning tables over and over. not once did anyone ask how our food was or our experience  not even the manager who was there. i ordered the pesto chicken sandwich and the cream of broccoli soup. my sandwich had no pesto on it, it was completely dry. one half of my sandwich had a total of 5 of the saddest tiny pieces of chicken ive ever seen. it wasnt anywhere close to covering the bread. so i combined that chicken with the other half to make one good half sandwich. i went to the counter to tell them my sandwich had no pesto thinking its new restaurant growing pains and the girl proceeds to tell me its actually a pesto butter and that next time i need to ask for extra if i want more. ok? once i added this and the chicken, my half sandwich was pretty good. the soup was not warm, its probably been sitting in its vat for hours since the place is dead. it was gross.i also got a chocolate covered strawberry with walnuts  which, much to my dismay, was soggy and did not taste good. it must have been sitting on the shelf too long.the only positive thing i have to say is the place was so clean since all the workers were bored and cleaned the empty restaurant the whole time. i might try the place again in a few months if theyre not out of business.
i decided to try this place today because its near my house and has a drive thru. needless to say, my husband and i dont plan to return. im giving it two stars because 1 the staff was nice 2 the bread was tasty. everything else was subpar though and for the price, you can get a much better quality, value and portion at corner bakery or paradise bakery. we went through drive thru and my husband ordered the reuben and i ordered a tuna sandwich. with no sides or drinks, the bill was over 16. the sandwiches took close to ten minutes to get and the reuben was very thin with only a couple pieces of meat on it. my tuna sandwich consisted only of bread, minimal tuna and lettuce. no tomato was even offered and everything was just dry and haphazardly strewn together. they apologized for making us wait in the drive thru window for so long and must have felt bad because they threw in some random bag of broken up chewy chips which consisted of mostly crumbs. it was all in all an odd and pretty low quality meal. too bad because its a great location, but ill drive further for a much higher quality sandwich somewhere else.
the food is whatever. it kind of reminds me of paradise bakery and panera. kind of the same concept, although, they do have a drive thru. i ordered a pesto and chicken sandwich, but it had not pesto... this was really annoying because i love pesto and was excited to try it, and, when food has ingredients like pesto in it, it is always more expensive, so i paid more money for a sandwich that was basically your average chicken sandwich with veggies and mayo... subway can make the same thing! they do have a very large selection of pastries and baked goods, but i didnt try any of them. the sandwich being wrong did it for me.
this place is, meh. not amazing and not terrible. service was fast and pleasant, food was okay but each dish lacked something. i will preface my review with the fact that i have been to vietnam and know authentic when i eat it.we ordered the fresh spring rolls and they were pretty plain, ordinary, and had way too much vermicelli and not enough meat and veggies. we had the bun bo hue, which didnt seem to have any lemongrass flavor at all, and it lacked blood cake. the pho broth had a simple flavor, nothing that would knock your socks off. even with building the flavor with basil, lime, sprouts, jalepeno, hoisin and sriracha, it still didnt taste that great yes, i know there is no sriracha in vietnam. i would recommend this establishment to those who have never tried vietnamese food andor for those who want to explore the cuisine, it is good. for me, ill stick to my favorite spot in town.
i gave this place a shot because my usual place was closed for a week.  i wish i would of waited.  the nail tech was very nice and she tried but she took twice as long and it cost me 15 more than i usually pay. 34 is way to much for a fill.  especially since it was a sub par fill.  i do like the design of the salon and the counter idea.
they charge you for chips and salsa! weve never been to a mexican restaurant where we had to pay for chips and salsa!!! also, the salsa was very cold. its supposed to be room temperature, right?i ordered the mahimahi tacos. they were good. if you like beans and rice along with your meal, youll be disappointed. the tacos came on a big plate with no side items. the drinks were great! i recommend the mojito. yummy! service was good. our waitress was awesome. i didnt get her name, though. she was an africanamerican lady with long hair. she was quick to refill our drinks and came to our table many times. she was friendly and very knowledgable.
overpriced, fair to average food, small portions.  really excellent wait service.  31.00 for 3 small steak tacos, tiny amt of black beans, inedable green rice.  pepsi and chips.
the chips were thick and hard, the salsas lacked flavor. the tacos were soggy and bland. worst tex mex ive had in a long time.
i didnt think you could remove the flavor of food so much and have it still look like food. sorry, i am coming from socal. so this was sorta insulting. wait staff was okay. everything else was fine.
my brother in law wanted tacos, so we yelp tacos and found this place. omg this place restricts your availability for tacos. only had chicken, pork and fish tacos. majority of people were whites and asians, we were the only hispanics there, the service was bad food was terrible. only bright side was the chef came out to greet us and she was such a sweetheart, shes the only reason i gave this place 2 stars
thought for it being on the strip and at ballys casino, it would have been great.. very disappointing!  food was cold.... service poor..after we sent our food back, the server didnt check back with us to see how it was! the only saving grace was the marguerites.  i recommend you eat before you go and have a marguerita only!
i love krispy kreme and go whenever im in the area. i went this morning and because there was a line issue, i was given a box of donuts from yesterday!!! ive had hot and ive had fresh and ive had day old and this was definitely day old.
give me a break. this place is below average. the cupcakes are awful. cold, not fresh. the doughnuts are mediocre at best. i had faith, but they didnt deliver.
i love the variety of baked goods offered.  the cinnamon apple filled donut, banana nut muffin and tomato basil bagel are among my favorites.  the staff are friendly and helpful.  today i had to remove two stars.  i come in four days a week and had not been offered a punch card for a free donut.  i had to ask for one.  not the way to do business with someone who was been a loyal patron.
would be 4 star. had french toast monticristo which was pretty good. called back to order it again and was told they never had that at this location. even with it clearly on this locations online menu.
having tried first watch twice now.1st time service was excellent but the eggs were cold and the coffee had a burnt taste to it.2nd time service was very poor an unfriendly, slow in getting order out as well forgetting part of the order, thanks to another staff member whom took the time to get the order correctly.the first waitress charged for a cup of coffee that was never ordered, as well very clumsy in removing the dirty dishes.  dropping food an silverware on the floor, she picked the silverware up but let the food on the floor. who know that food might be still on the floor!
second time eating here. food is good, but the service is just awful. 8 tables with 7 wait staff and still the service made a burger king employee seem overly willing to help.
the food here at first watch is quite good. unfortunately, i cant say the same for the service weve had here thus far. from the moment we sat down, our server really seemed less than enthusiastic to actually help us. she didnt introduce herself, dropped off our water, then walked away and barely said a word to us the whole time we were there. it got to the point where i was the one saying thank you to her for her service, just to see if she would even acknowledge us. needless to say, we didnt leave a very good tip. as someone who enjoys eating at different restaurants, there is a certain level of professionalism and customer service that i expect. a simple, good morning and thanks for coming in from our waitress, desma, would have been appreciated. instead, it was almost as if she was upset that we were eating there to begin with. good food.....poor service.
to me the food is bordering institutional. its a notch or two above dennys. we have some 5 star breakfast options in the area like vincents bistro, and la grande orange. coming soon well have matts big breakfast. quite honestly, i dont understand how a place like first watch will survive the competition. on a positive note, the decor is quite nice and makes for a decent place to meet for a business conversation with a safe, but nothing special meal. sorry first watch; i was hoping that youd make a better addition to the neighborhood.
stopped in for a late lunch.  okay, so it was like 45 minutes before they close.  i should have known better.  i ordered the blte, which is supposed to be a bacon, lettuce, tomato sandwich with a fried egg added.  i would think that on a sandwich like this, the bacon would be the star, but alas this was not to be.  what little bacon that was on the sandwich, maybe a slice and a half, was burnt black and crisp, it kinda looked like they dredged it up from the bottom of somewhere just so they could get back to closing down the line 45 minutes early.  the rest of the sandwich was great  the egg was fried perfectly, cheese was all melted and apart from the disappointing bacon, not a bad sandwich.im sorry i bothered them so late in the day.  i learned my lesson.  ill be back, but only for breakfast.addendum:  hi eleni, thank you for your reply.  id just like to let you know that i most certainly know the difference between smoked dark meat, and greasy, bottom of the bin leftover bacon.  im sorry i neglected to take any photos, that would have shown everybody what it looked like.  otoh, maybe that is a good thing for you.  ive been a customer of first watch on and off for over twenty years, at different locations, of course, but i will say this is the first time i came for lunch.
well... it wasnt as good as it appeared..i ordered eggs over easy with the pumpkin pancakei forgot what they called it on the menu.pancake was crumbly and didnt hold together very well and the eggs had a surprising amount of oil on them.i also ordered a carrot, apple ginger juice which i dare say.. the ingredients came out of a containerpre made?? and im wondering if there was any ginger in it at all.. in short, it didnt seem like much care was put into the preparation and i guess the servers could care less about what theyre serving.  although the greeting upon entry was very welcoming, everything else was at best meh..  i recommend somewhere else.. and read these reviews..they help.  thats where i went wrong.
beer?  great!  saison was my fave. ambience and decor?  very loud and uncomfortable seating except the sweet area in the middle with a couple leather chairs.  wood bar and tables look amazing but our table wobbled every time someone moved. outside area looked nice but it was hot outside so i didnt check it out. view of brewery equipment?  stellar.  overall its a great place to go for a good beer but i wouldnt go out of my way to go back there.  it is beside the brass tap and near common market so one could make a fun bar crawl out of it!  food truck friday is also nearby so the location means i probably will go back simply because ill be in south end for other events.
just okay. the girl serving us was nice, but the food wasnt satisfying. personally, i wont go there until maybe after a while.
this initial rating is based on my first experience here. i will update it if i revisit. i was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. it was nicely decorated and when you enter, there is a front desk like you are entering a hotel. there are upstairs seatings and a private room on the main floor. unlike other typical chinese restaurants, where the tables have sauces, pepper, salt etc., this place has none. just clean tables. bench seats along the wall and nice chairs. there was also no tv but be prepared to see other chinese patrons talking loudly and playing their video shows while they eat  just like a typical chinese restaurant. upon approaching the main door, an electronic version of fur elise will play in the restaurant. this is to let the wait staff know someone is coming in and they can hustle to greet them. no one is at the front desk to greet. first time i heard it i thought it was cool. then with each guest coming in, the loud music played overheard until it got very annoying. their staff cant tell if someone just left or someone is coming. i got excited when i saw that there were photos of the dishes in the menu. the charcoal lamb chops looked so good that 3 separate tables ordered it. warning  photos in menu is not representative of the actual dish. the charcoal lamb chops took a while to come out. when it did, it was pathetic. super dry, 4 bones with very little meat because it was cooked way over done. drizzled over the bones were crushed peppercorn, smoky and not spicy. 2 of the bones even had the skin on it and dont try to chew the skin unless you have steel jaws and iron teeth. i thought it was just my dish but the next table got the same thing and commented on the skin too. 20 for 4 pcs of over cooked lamb chops is over priced. my battery ran out before i could take a photo of that dish. i also overheard the other table saying one dish is too salty and the other is too sour. anyway, i would not recommend the charcoal lamb chops. i might return to try other didhes.
its silly that their delivery zone is so small! i love their sandwiches but sad i have to cross the street to meet them at circle k if i want a sandwich which im not willing to do. so, i guess firehouse subs that is next door gets our business
read the article in the gazette about the opening, so thought i would try it out.  when we arrived, the crowd was fairly sparse about three groups dining, no line.  considering i often wait 20 minutes at black dog, this was a definite plus.  its the kind of place where you order at the counter and the food is brought out to you, which i prefer for a place like this.when i placed my order, i was informed that they were out of the burnt ends and the pulled chicken my first two choices along with a couple sides.  i opted for the brisket sandwich with a side of pit beans, as i feel this is a good barometer of a bbq restaurants overall quality.  the sandwich and single side cost me 10.90 w tax, before tip with no drink.  not outrageous, but its probably double what i would have paid at porgys and maybe even a little more than black dog.the overall quality was fairly average.  the beef had good flavor, but was a little fatty and tough.  the bbq sauce was very average and in short supply.  the beans were also pretty average. i will say that the amount of meat on the sandwich was very generous and i didnt walk away hungry by any means.  the customer service was great; friendly and quick.  helped that not many other people were there.overall, i dont see how this place makes it in an already crowded marketplace for bbq restaurants.  black dog, po boys, porgys, and even hickory river are better options in my mind sorry smokys and are right around the corner. even chesters bbq truck at tumble inn is probably a better bet.  not sure how i can justify spending almost 11 on a sandwich and one side when porgys is probably better and 40 cheaper.   it doesnt even come close to black dog quality, which with a second location opening, is always my first choice.  also, i am pretty sure they dont have booze could be wrong about that, i got my order to go.  i hope they can pull it off, but i just dont see choosing this place again with so many better bbq options available.
i love eating at a new restaurant; exploring the menu, asking questions, and recommending to friends. i was excited to hear lacys was getting an urbana location. it was empty when i came in the early afternoon so i was greeted warmly at the counter and asked about the menu. after some small talk, i chose the rib tip  platter to go.  there was some confusion about payment and someone elses order, but i understand that is all new business hiccups. the service was fairly quick and staff was so friendly im sad to give them two stars. however, those stars are specifically for the food. i give some slack for my to go order being lukewarm since i had to go back to work and eat. the tips however were pretty dry and didnt have any seasoning. i tend to like my tips fatty so the sinewy alternative disappointed me. the side was a small cup of pineapple coleslaw, which essentially was regular cabbage slaw with pineapple chunks in it. the fries were actually good and what i expected. steak fries make this meal just a little better. bbq is pretty pricey so i never expect to spend less than 10 for anything i get. i really hope to try some other things and alter my review in the future. i want this place to do well and since its only the beginning, so they have plenty of time! heres hoping.
great service with a friendly atmosphere. i really wanted to like the food because the employees were so nice, but the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were not tasty. the bread was soggy but the sauce was good. for the price i would expect a bbq sandwich similar to black dog but it was nowhere near as delicious. hopefully they improve and stick around because they seemed very nice.
sometimes with my dislike for a restaurant i want to keep things to myself because i feel bad, but i honestly dont understand how yelp people are loving this place and i am not. maybe its me. but my husband felt the same and he is way less picky than me. i went to art of flavors before it closed and i disliked it then. i recall my husband and i sharing a cup and mentioning thank goodness we ate at goodwich otherwise we would have felt very underwhelmed going all the way over there for this gelato. if we have to share a cup, something is wrong. we always want our own cup. we never went back after our first time. well its been some time since we had gelato at art of flavors and decided to try gelatology since it has such good reviews. ok thank goodness the drive was not that far, but i still feel like i wasted my gas money, time, and calories. it was not bad by any means, it just was not good. hmmm okay maybe i am trying to make it sound better and i cant. the base flavor tasted like nothing, and i believe i tried 8 plus flavors and did not like any of them. how can that be? i dont get it. cookie butter was bland and just okay. pear and gorgonzola tasted very odd to me. peanut butter flavor tasted like pb2 powder i add to my smoothies, thats not really a good thing. i love peanut butter, how do i not love this? cookies and cream was even bad. i dont know how that can be bad. coconut barely tasted like anything. i dont know, i love coconut. i am confused. i cant remember the other flavors i tried, but they were not good to me. soooo, i could not decide on a flavor. that usually means because i like so many of them. in this case, i could not decide because i did not like any of the flavors i tried. when i asked my hubby what size should we get i could already tell we were sharing by his reaction to the samples, he said small. i almost laughed out loud. share a small? we all know gelato is very little portions, so he must really dislike it without saying it. so, we shared a small cookie butter. i love cookie butter but this barely resembled cookie butter. me at gelatology can be summed up in one word: underwhelmed. i wish i got to try the green tea kit kat or bread pudding, that looks amazing. that was not their flavor that day. i will stick to my favorite gelato in vegas.
came here with no expectations. ordered kung pow chicken, seafood fried rice, and shrimp dumplings. was told that the shrimp dumplings had pork in it so i ordered the veggie dumpling. i dont eat red meat or pork. was recommended to order the combination fried rice and they would add more shrimp and remove the meat. the combination fried rice had beef in it. they charged me for squash dumplings which is not on the menu and one dollar more than the meat dumplings. when did squash prices raise higher than shrimp and pork?all the food came out cold. peanuts in the kung pow chicken were raw. food was not good.service was better than other restaurants but we were the only people there.only redeeming point to my visit here were the two smoothies that they comped us: mango and durian. they were actually pretty good. we asked for low sugar and they actually have us what we wanted.will not be coming back.
we came back on a saturday during lunch, not very busy, just a few tables by the time we ordered. food came out very fast but was very disappointed that the cooking seemed to have gone downhill. my daughter ordered the crab rangoon, it came out over fried and the wonton skin was dark brown, almost burnt. it was very obvious but the waiter did not seem to want to notice. the lunch special general tso chicken was really hard to bite into, it seemed to have been cooked a long time ago and was just refried with some sauce slopped over it...it was bad. the chicken fried rice was rice that was clumped together and brown with soy sauce like what you usually get from most cheap chinese take out but at 9, it was totally not cool. chicken chow mein was just too oily. the only thing that was kind of good was the pot stickers. our little lunch was over 50 and for the quality of what we had i could have had better from panda express and much cheaper, no kidding. we left most of our food uneaten and did not even want to take it home. sad to see the somewhat having potential cheerful house going downhill so soon.
saturday night  the restaurant had 2 other people eating dinner... not a good sign.  we ordered the family dinner for 2.  we ordered egg drop soup and the waiter brought out hot  sour soup.  he graciously exchanged it for the correct soup.  we asked for crispy noodles  they did not have any yet.  we asked for low sodium soy sauce and were told that they only have regular soy sauce.  we were still eating our soup when the egg roll, shrimp and crab rangoon arrived.  each appetizer was fine but nothing special.  while still getting through the soup  apps, out came an order of lemon chicken.  hmmm, we ordered orange beef and cashew chicken.  ok, they took away the wrong chicken and brought the orange beef.  this dish was prepared nicely, if a bit overly sweet  sauced heavily.  the cashew chicken arrived next and we asked about our fried rice, which really should have been served at the same time as the main dishes.  it was brought out a few minutes later and really was the highlight of the meal.disjointed kitchenwait staff, average food, decent atmosphere.  not enough for us to return.
pretty disappointed overall. i made an order for delivery just a few minutes before closing. they delivered my food pretty quickly, about 35 min, and i was happy they took the late order. the veg egg rolls where decent, little did i know they would be the best part of the meal. next i had the hot and sour soup. this is the first time i ever ordered this soup but it was a cold night and sounded good : it was hot in temperature and that was about it. the flavor was bland and i didnt like the consistency. unfortunately after 23 bites i couldnt eat anymore. i followed up with general taos chicken. not the most authentic dish but one that i like to get down on when im feeling naughty. tasted like the chicken was fried in the fish batter. the chicken quality was questionable and again after a few bites i decided it wasnt worth the calories. overall i was very disappointed which is too bad because the late night 9:45 delivery was a nice option.
this place was ok, the best meat is definitely the carne asada. the food wasnt very flavorful and the tacos only come with lettuce and pico, everything else is extra. the liquor store right next to the restaurant makes for a sketchy atmosphere, taco guild is 100 better and more authentic.
found this place on yelp looking for a cheap taco joint near asu. i was quite disappointed with the food i received. i ordered three carne aside tacos with rice and beans. the rice and beans were tasty but my tacos were nothing special at all. they werent even served with cilantro or oniona taco necessity, instead it was sprinkled with some old brown lettuce and diced tomatoes. also each taco came to be three dollars which is pretty expensive for the type and quality of the little tacos. i wont be coming back.
visiting phx from nyc, i was looking forward to testing the mettle of this pretty popular lunch spot. i drove passed the restaurant multiple times during my stay to find the parking lot full  thats pretty impressive for any place that labels itself a deli. it had to be awesome, no? no. the new yorker  pastrami and cole slaw on rye  was bland, boring, and bogus. it had no flavor, except for the tang of the slaw, and the bread was stiff, like it had been stored away in a fridge all night. it was disappointing, kind of like when you wanted that bike for christmas but then got two little rubber balls instead  one for each hand. but im not unreasonable or naive; i know its difficult to make a pastrami sandwich that can stand next to the greats like katzs or langers 2nd ave deli, carnegie deli, etc. i dont walk into a deli in phoenix expecting the pastrami gods to rain down on me a storm of deliciously irresistible and perfectly sliced pieces of cured meats; i dont have unrealistic expectations. i just wanted a decent pastrami sandwich but i didnt get it. it fell flat, completely flat.having said all that negative stuff, though, i must admit that the restaurant itself is wellrun, overwhelmingly clean, and their service is topnotch  everyone was pleasant and helpful. also, i cant deny that all the food looked appetizing and fresh. my sandwich fell flat but i cant speak to anything else. my son had the kids hot dog and he loved it. i would suggest try the food. the food on the menu and behind the deli case looks good. give it a shot. i might if i had to but i wouldnt order the pastrami sandwich or new yorker again.
food is soso. placed an order for pickup. side was wrong, sandwich wasnt toasted and service was generally lackluster. central phoenix is known for great food spots. this isnt one of them.
i had the cod and i wasnt impressed. obviously it was frozen. it tasted very fishy and wasnt flaky. the crust on top was like gum. never had to use a knife before to eat fish. the macaroni  cheese was average at best. definitely not homemade tasting at all. all in all not worth 11 bucks! i will say that the kosher hot dogs are very good. i guess people come here for the sandwiches but thats not my thing. i wanted to try the bread pudding but its supposed to be served warm with vanilla sauce or ice cream so theirs is obviously not fresh as its sitting there sliced behind the glass like cake. i wont be back as to me all the hype ended up being just a tad bit better than cafeteria food
really love the ice coffee! however, we went for bagels the other day and they were not good. i ordered a poppy seed bagel with cream cheese, but it tasted like a costco bagel with very little flavor. my fiance ordered a onion with butter and they covered his bagel with butter. i mean covered! it was all butter in every bite. not sure if we will return. we will go to nosh for our bagel fix.
having visited the noda location several times i was quite excited to try their newest location. all of the food and pastries are the same, and the quality is very good.  this review is more about the customer service experience i had on the second day of this location was open, and the cleanliness of the establishment. both were very, very, very, poor. its cool that you can bring a lock to profess your love and put it on a fence, but the romance is kinda lost when you have to step over and around garbage and uneaten food that has spilled out of the overflowing trash can on the outside patio. its real hip to have a coffee bar, but the cool factor is lost when the barista has no idea what splenda is or even looks like. makes me wonder if they know what espresso is, or is it all just coffee to them?   we began our visit later in the day and waited 30 minutes in line to order.   the young woman that helped us at the counter did not greet us and plated our selection in silence. the cashier was even worse, though she had to talk to us in order to let me know how much i owed. she didnt thank us or offer any good by. a blank look told me my transaction had ended and that she was finished with me. if this was my business, she would have been terminated instantly. seriously. it was that bad. the air conditioning was either broken that day  or they wanted us to experience what it is like to work in the bakery near the oven. the heat inside, combined with the fumes from fresh paint drove us outside to the trash strewn patio. its lovely and the chairs are very comfortable. sadly the dirty tables, and overflowing trash bin kinda spoiled it. one poor guy was sitting at a table near this trash bin and got a leg full of what looked like milk, frosting could also have been whip cream and some other brownish liquid when another patron foolishly tried to throw something away, and a big pile of trash spilled out of the bin. thankfully there were no yellow jackets, but if they continue to let the trash overflow, they will attract them for sure. my family and i finished our pastries and decided to throw our trash away inside.  the first and only trash bin we encountered was full to the top. not wanting to add to this debacle, we left our trash on a table and left. its going to be awhile before i return. they must get their sanitation routine down better and they need to weed through a few lousy cashiers and counter help before they are up to acceptable standards.
i hate that i am having to do this. i have been so excited about amelies coming to south charlotte for months. i went yesterday for some iced coffee and was totally unimpressed. the decor is cool but, not as eclectic as noda. the staff and barista treated me like just another customer something i never feel at starbucks. the whole restaurant smelled of wet paint. i realize it just opened but, come on. when i went to the condiments station the trash can was filthy with food particles on the receptacle. really quite disgusting. i was also shocked to see piles of dirty dishes on a trolly in the middle of the restaurant, right next to where you doctor up your coffee. really gross. hope they work out some of these things. i am willing to give it another try because, well, the coffee is delicious!
i have been to the noda location many times...always great coffee, service,and food.  the best.  however, i was very disappointed at my experience at this location.  ordered a cafe au lait and the staff member said how do you say that again? im not sure we have that. very nice but poorly trained. then i ordered my favorite  a simple chocolate croissant  couldnt wait to eat it on my way to work but i could not have been more disappointed.  the worst croissant i have ever had. rubbery, dry and tasteless. i took 2 bites then threw the rest away. i hope it was a day old...otherwise there are problems with the pastry chef. i will give it another shot but they for sure have work to do there. 2 stars is generous.
thee worst customer service... okay not the worse but it was kind of up there. i had my lips tooted for a brownie. tooted! i just wanted a regular brownie and i dont know what i was thinking cuz i know they dont have them at the noda location, so why would they have them here... but its all good. i know they have the caramel brownies which my husband loves and purchased 3 of them as usual. okay on to the disservice. we walk in and were the only ones at the counter. a young girl and guy are talking and dont even bother to acknowledge us. i guess once we get closer to look like were about to order something theyre standing in front of us still talking. i guess the young girl is ready to take our order as she just looks at us. no hi. no how can i help you? no what do you want?, so i just start ordering. now normally i would just leave but i could not for the life of me think of a place to buy a single brownie... just one. so i ordered one of the triple chocolate layered joints and a macaroon. figured i get something cuz my dude was not deterred by the service. nothing was going to get in the way of him and a caramel brownie. get to the register and the dude says nothing. just rings up our order. i mean do these people get tips? they cant be. theyre horrible. its like they dropped off the leftovers from the noda spot which ive never had any semblance of an issue at that location. anywho my dude comments on the horrible service once we left. i guess he may go back because he cant part with his precious caramel brownie. i think i can convince him not to.im not giving my money to a place where a person cant say one simple word hi to me. we figure well just venture over to the other spot. its closer to our jobs anyway. fyi: i gots my brownie at the fresh market right down the street. bonus: i got a lemon bar too. how were they? slammin!!!
desperate service, dirty tables, such a shame as i was really excited about this place opening. we love the noda location but it was a bit of a hike.  it was very quiet on a sunday at 10.30am yet i had to wait over 10 mins for a baguette to go. the guy who took my order asked if i wanted it warmed and sliced, i said no but thats how i got it anyway. the management need to get their act together and train their staff.
i was so excited to try this place after reading the reviews from the other locations. the husband and i went for desert on date night. the place was really busy. i chose a torte and he chose a strawberry cake...sorry for the lack of description.  bottom line is that the pastries were just ok. nothing to write home about. service was just ok as well. i would return simply because there are no other bakeries of this kind in the area. its a relaxed atmosphere which is nice. great for dates and just chatting with friends.
the dessert is fine... but closed at 9pm and all you sell is dessert? ... not happy. they let me in before they shut the doors, but wouldnt sell me an espresso because the machine is off... why would you shut down the coffee at a dessert bar? so i asked for a glass of wine... nope sorry, out of it.... really? next time either come early, which means earlier dinner reservations, or just go elsewhere... maybe noda, where its open 24hr.. their hours and service are much better... this place needs time, but it carries an elite name? poor franchise...
expensive. good, but 6 for a egg and 1 strip of very thin bacon sandwich? might was well go to mcdonalds or jack in the box to get a good breakfast at a better price. could have gotten similar at fast food, with a drink and saved 2.
i really like the concept of this chain, and had a great impression of the one at davidson.i decided to check this location out and ordered a cappuccino and a croissant.well, that wasnt a cup of cappuccino, more of an instant coffee with a lattekind of foam. and i asked a barista if it was a cappuccino i ordered, she was positive. it was not cappuccino, it wasnt a good coffee at all. very bitter, disgusting taste.a croissant  not fresh, not crusty and just had a taste of old butter. disappointing experience.i asked them to replace my coffee with their icetea  which is hard to spoil. it was good.
while checking my yelp app, i was excited to find that there was a new amelies location outside of noda, not far from where we were.  after dinner, we stopped by for dessert at 7 p.m..  we found the new amelies at the end of the strip mall plaza and, upon entering, loved that they recreated the look of the noda location and had plenty of seating.  we walked up to the counter to view the pastry cases.  they looked a little bare boned, not what were used to at the amelies in noda.  we inquired about the chocolate croissants.  we were informed that they were out of them as we could see in the empty case and that the best time to get pastries is in the mornings.  huh.  frustrated, we just left, dessertless.  the cases at the noda location always seem full of every dessert whenever weve stopped by, no matter what time of day it was.  so now we have to base our dessert options on when we come?  no thanks.  i dont just want leftovers.  fail.
we had high hopes for this location. our first trip we had sandwiches and coffee. it was ok. nothing spectacular. our desserts were not good. they all tasted freezer burnt. my 13yo son ordered his drink, a cafe glace, and the cashier was extremely rude to him like having a child talk to her was unacceptable. she kept looking at me instead of him. she seemed aghast that he wanted coffee and asked him at least 4 times if he really wanted an iced coffee said very slowly. give me a break. he is a teen standing next to his mother. just take his order without the attitude. my husband and i gave them another chance for a dessert and coffee date. our french press of coffee was delicious and beautifully served. all of the stars in this review are for that coffee. our pastries were awful. i ordered a napoleon. the pastry, which should be flaky and crunchy, was soggy and wet. the cream filling tasted off. when my husband took it up to the register to complain the cashier took it to the back. the chef in the back looked at it and said i was wrong. uhmm, it was dripping and clearly soggy.  the cashier begrudgingly replaced it with two macarons. the original pastry cost more than the two macarons. she did not offer any sort of equivalent or refund. not cool. my husband had a strawberry cake type pastry. it was frozen in the middle. he picked at it but it was too solid to actually eat. my replacement macarons were ok. one was good and fresh the other was freezer burnt.
kept hoping their pastries would get better but its only getting staler, smaller and less impressive for the money.  sooooo sad about it too, because we used to love the uptown location.
i wasnt really that impressed with amelies. i hear a lot about it so when they opened one near my job i thought id give it a try since ive been on this macaron search lately. walking in for the 1st time i saw a line. so naturally i stand in the line. the girls behind the case were just looking at me, didnt say a word. i see more people come in and they asked them what theyd like and the customers walked up to the case. did they really just watch me stand in this slow line for 10 minutes and not ask to help me?? what was wrong with me that they didnt lend me their assistance? was there a booger in my nose??? when the customers got in line behind me i asked them about the correct ordering protocol and they directed me to the case. thanks to those ladies for their help. the macarons werent that great. were kind of mushy. it was weird. they were also overly sweet. i took a bite out of each and threw them in the trash. almost 3 each wasted. i did like how the space was big and open. i would return if i needed a spot to plug in my laptop for a bit and hang out. other than that, they wouldnt be my 1st choice.
we visited this amelies location for treats for my birthday. everything in the case is so incredibly beautiful. so fun to shop with your eyes. the young man helping us was very nice and helped explain several items to us. we selected our items and had them packaged to go. verdict. macarons were the best thing we purchased  as has been the case on previous visits. the cinnamon sugar with chocolate filling is just divine. the rest of our choices were okay to bad. my husband had a chocolate cupcakesmall cake that was pretty okay. my son chose a similar sized cake with white cake and strawberries. big disappointment. first, the glazed strawberry on top was moldy!  yup. moldy!  there was no mold on the icing, but i cut around that part anyway. the cake flavor was very good. the buttercream is not to my liking at all!!!  ive tried it on a previous visit and thought maybe we had a bad batch. no. i completely understand that french pastries are often not as sweet as us versions, but this buttercream tastes like it has zero sugar. it basically just tastes like butterfat. given that the item was refrigerated, the icing is solidified and the mouth feel is identical to butter. very off putting. lastly, my other sons chocolate eclair was fine. not great. not bad either. all in all, considering the price, i will stick with a macaron if i visit amelies again.
went in today to try the hot chocolate after watching a travel show that highlighted how much better french hot cocoa is compared to the standard usa version. so, i ordered one and it was delicious but it was even cooler than luke warm. i asked a couple of employees at the cashiers post if my mug could be warmed up in their microwave but they refused and said that would violate health codes. they offered to add hot milk to the cold hot chocolate, which would have diluted it  changed the flavor profile as well as not doing anything to warm up the current large mug of liquid, so i begrudgingly declined the offer and returned to my table. a bit later, one of the young employees who said she was a manager saw me at the table  we made eye contact  she then asked if i was sure i didnt want hot milk added to my now very cool hot chocolate. i explained the dilution problem. she responded that she could have chocolate added, also, but i didnt like that idea. it would be a guessing game bc it wasnt being prepared from beginning to end with proper quantities of ingredients. she then offered to have a new one made. i was hopeful and thought it was appropriate for her to do so.  when she brought the new one over, it tasted nothing like the delicious first one that i had. the second one was very milky with very little chocolate. it tasted weak and boring. there was zero quality consistency. also, the new supposedly hot mug was barely hot.  i just nodded and thanked her; at that point, it was useless. i wont be ordering their hot chocolate ever again, sadly. beware, if they dont make your hot chocolate or coffee hot for that matter, you now know that you have zero recourse but to waste the first one and throw it away andor or have a second one made. what a waste of product and money. amelie owner main manager:  train your staff to create propely heated hot drinks and food notorious for serving cold soup and if you refuse to serve hot food hot, then invest in a microwave for the dining area like some other eateries often do. update: amelie management contacted me and was very gracious. explained that what i experienced isnt customary. also, its quiche is outstanding, as well as breakfast sandwiches, and tartines. this review and my rating was on the hot cocoa experience
this place is up and down. last time i was here, i had a  great sandwich and coffee. today i went to do a little work and got another sandwich and coffee. this time, the service was rude. the girl behind the counter was apparently trying to get my attention, but was barely audible over the music and talking. she couldnt have been trying for more than a couple seconds, but when i looked back at her, she was rolling her eyes. i ordered a ham,  egg, and gruyere croissant, and a cappuccino with almond milk lactose intolerant. they ended up messing up my sandwich and giving me a cappuccino with whole milk. i couldnt tell until later, when my stomach started giving me fits. i payed 11 for this, and feel like i was wasting their time in the process. ill give them another try since they seem to be hit or miss. ill just have to try to be on my best behavior so that i dont piss off the staff.
was really excited to try the new location in south charlotte. loved the decor and the menu looked promising. could not stay to dine in, so i bought a small vanilla cake with a strawberry on top, to take home. and while it looked absolutely mouthwatering, i have to say that i was really disappointed in it. i cut it in half to share with my grandson, and the cake fell apart. not in a good way. the cake completely separated from the frosting that was on top and in the middle. and neither had any taste to it. it was like eating cardboard. we did not even finish the half, after 2 bites each, we threw it out, plus the other half in the box. while i was not expecting it to taste like a pastry shop in paris, i did expect alot more from a 7 cake.
food was super average. got a burger with crack fries. crack fries were good but burger was so so. beer selection was great but 18 for a pitcher is ridiculous.
i had a pretty good time at hopcat drinking beer and eating mussels...until i got the bill.i went there on a monday and got half off on mussels  this was a pretty good deal, around 9 bucks for a full order. the mussels were tender and plentiful.however i split a pitcher of milwaukee brewing company booyah farmhouse ale, a 9 a sixpack solid beer. they charged a whopping 21.50 for the pitcher. you can buy the same pitcher at the memorial union for 14.if youre rolling in dough, i would recommend hopcat to try some rare beers on tap, otherwise, plenty of other establishments around madison sell similar beers for a fraction of the cost.
meh.  the burger was good, but the bun thick and dry.  good value for happy hour, but i wouldnt pay regular price for it 12.  fries were decent but nothing special, not crack like they claim. friendly and attentive staff.  dont know who is in charge of the music, but that person might be on crack.  one minute awesome 80s alt rock, the next really awful mellow 70s, the next minute the killers.  pick a theme and go with it, dont try to please everyone.  four stars for happy hour, two stars for regular prices and music.
id this place a higher rating if people didnt think it was so wonderful. it is true: they have a lot of beers. it is true: their food is really good. it is true: their waitstaff is knowledgable. however, the atmosphere is falsely urban, the lights were way too dark, and the music was way too loud. i would really like to like this place, but i felt alienated from everything. for what you pay, the portions are awfully small and i couldnt hear my friends. better bet? go to brassiere v or alchemy!
have been here about 5 times since they have opened and every time there seems to be something that goes wrong. first time i went i was denied with my real legal id, now i understand hop cat has to be careful with the id but why the bouncer looked in my personal email on my phone and facebook and still denied me was very annoying. i signed my name three times for him too. i did contact management and they were very apologetic which was nice. as far as service goes: harvest is the only server that gets our drinks to us in under 5 minutes. one time it took 11 minutes for us to get our beers, and other times its always more than 5 minutes which i find rediculous harvest also will check up on us often which i really appreciate. now heres my real reason for giving 2 stars...skunky tasting and smelling beer. the first week all of the beers tasted fresh and how they should but now  i just last week the beers do not taste at all like they should which is very disappointing considering they obviously take pride in having so many taps but i dont see the point when they all taste skunky. i work at a bar where we clean our tap lines every 46 weeks and it makes all the difference for taste. i will not be going back to hop cat just for that reason alone. ill gladly wait 11 minutes for great tasting beer but thats not what you will find at hop cat.
daaaamn gina. i am so addicted to those crack fries. they taste like cracked black pepper but they addict me like crack cocaine. and you know me! i love that yayo. yayoooo.i also love me some pretzel nuggz cuz i gotta get some nuggz up in this mug. mmmmmm yeah.and and and my bae she loves that muffin top vegetarian sandwichez. shes gotta get that vegantarian shit because im not fucking with no faatties.so im impressed and like, you know i had to tell all my boys here on yelp because, gotta hit it. get all up in this bitch cuz hopcat is the heat.there was a really smart, pleasant bartender who worked here and knew a lot about beers. god save his soul. or at the very least, please let him get a job at the myriad of other good craft beer bars in this city.
forgotten crack fries, hair in our entree, and not a cent deducted from the bill or even a manager apology. get it together hopcat. the novelty of your arrival will soon rub off once people see that the food and service is subpar.the beer selection is good though. maybe they count on people being buzzeddrunk and not noticing how bad everything else is.
look, i get it. im in madison. the packers rule the airwaves. as a a recent michigan expat in wisconsin i understand the packers should be on almost every tv in the area. however, its september 3rd read still nfl preseason and my michigan jim harbaughs are playing their first game of the actual season. so i sought out a familiar michiganstarted bar to belly up to drink away my inevitable disappointment. i went to hop cat in grand rapids frequently as an undergrad and figured there would be one tv devoted to the game.i got there right at 7:30, just in time for kickoff, but saw no tvs devoted to the game. i ordered the rye farmhouse ale on the menu and asked for a tv for the game. my waitress said it shouldnt be a problem to put the game on and went to go grab my beer.realizing she was dealing with an excessively effervescent beer and a finicky tap, i asked the next nearest bartender when you get a chance i was hoping to get the michiganutah game on. is that possible? he walked to the end of the bar, helped his customers and came back and immediately said i would have to talk to the manager!what?for a damn football game? for one tv?thinking i could have a reasonable conversation with the manager i acquiesced to no avail. stating he had already given up one tv for the uncncstate game i was rebuffed. apparently he couldnt spare another tv for an actual relevant game. i could either wait two quarters till the packers game was done or chug my high gravity beer and move to a different venue. i,  like any great midwesterner, would do chose the latter.tldr: hop cat is unreasonably concerned that someone from wisconsin will find out they are a company started in michigan. i went to hawks and was immediately provided not one, but two tvs to watch the game. if youre looking for someplace to watch sports and youre looking for customer service that isnt thoroughly underwhelming avoid hop cat.
first off, i resent standing in line when theres obviously a lot of empty tables that you can see from the window while youre waiting. the bouncerdoor men can be a bit uppity. beyond that, they do have a great beer list, but ive never suffered from a poor beer menu around here.the foods all sound really good, but they dont quite measure up to their descriptions on the menu.i dont dislike this place, but there are just so many great places around here that id rather spend my money. i dont think its worth waiting in line over, and i dont see the mystique.
i have been to hopcat 3 times prior to today. each of my previous experiences were enjoyable, something i cannot say about my experience this afternoon. the bar has great decor including over 10 tvs throughout the downstairs. i asked the server to change one of the 11 tvs to a different football game. i was not specific about which television just simply the most convenient one. since all the tvs in the bar were playing the exact same game, this obviously would not be an unreasonable request. the manager came to our table and told us that she would not change the channel because all 11 tvs had been requested, an insulting lie. disgusted with this statement after my meal, which was delicious, i traveled across the street to chasers bar and grill to see if they would handle my request. without hesitation the bartender happily granted my request in a bar that was twice as crowded as hopcat. overall i enjoy hopcat as an establishment but the blatant disregard for a customer request is something that shouldnt go unnoticed.
good beer and mediocre service.  not very busy but had to wait for second round of beer
i had high hopes coming here due to the hype around this new place. i was impressed upon arriving due to the decor and cozy atmosphere, after that however it all went downhill.i had made a reservation a week prior for 9pm for dinner and was not seating until 10pm. i was also told that i had my table until 11:45 which i understood....... when i was supposed to be seated at 9. immoderately at 11:45 we were told to leave our table. i said we would in 10 minutes when we finished our drinks. apparently that wasnt good enough because 3 minutes later the waiter was back motioning us to another table to finish our drinks.we were at our new location for about 1 minute before another waitress came to us and told us we had to move we still had not finished our drinks. again i said give us 10 minutes to finish and we will leave, not happening.all to say the experience was mediocre at best although the waitress tending to our drinks was very sweet and so were the hostesses.the food: meh. i had the tuna special and it was bland and rough.go here for the atmosphere. nothing else. and dont forget to reserve way in advance.
interesting design, the door almost looks like the place is under construction. the subbasement locale is a bit strange, but the decor is interesting. we came for an early business dinner, the service was spot on. the bartender was very nice as well and attractive, which doesnt hurt the eyes. the drinks were excellent. the food wasnt too great. they try to be too creative, and the result is interesting looking food with underwhelming taste. i ate here about 3 weeks ago, and i already forget what i ate it was so unmemorable.
decided to stop in for lunch after seeing a post on their facebook that they were finally open. when your namesake and food is based on french fries, logic dictates you should use quality, hand cut fries. the fries seemed to be out of a bag, a little over cooked, and just mediocre at best. poutine fries should be a thicker cut, and soft.the cheese had an odd taste to it. it certainly didnt taste like fresh curds, nor did it squeak. im not sure where these come from, but the cheese curds available at the dairy on broadway and hardy are more suitable for poutine. the gravy was ok. consistency was wrong, as it was a little too thick, almost pudding like. there wasnt enough, as once i got to the middle, the fries were naked. in montreal they do a layer of fries, curds and gravy, followed by another layer on top. gravy was quite salty as well, i can still taste the salt.i was assured on facebook that as a montrealer i wouldnt be disappointed. unfortunately i was. itll be good food for the bar crowd friday and saturday nights. ill try it again once they get into the swing of things, but i dont think ill be trying any of the gentrified options.
i was really looking forward to this place opening as i work in downtown tempe, and figured it would have mill ave prices, but i was astounded to pay 11 for a small order of cheese fries covered in unseasoned ground beef and a soda. especially when the fries are not fresh cut definitely frozen spuds and  there were maybe 5 or 6 cheese curds that didnt seem to be that great themselves. the worst part was i wasnt even full when i was done and also starving within 2 hours. the food is good but the portion and quality do not match the cost.
went to us fries today as it is a newer place on mill ave.  i gave it 2 stars, place is clean and people were nice just not informative of what the meal deal cost was.  thats the good.  the ok is the poitine, i bought the pork 3 ways and it was ok not bad but not great.  the really bad is the cost, the poutine was 7.99 and to make it a meal is 5.00 more which is really expensive to me for a drink and coleslaw which i am sorry to say was awful.  the coleslaw was drowning in mayonaise and just about inedible to me.  so with all thus said, i gave the new place a try but based on cost and what you get for that cost i will not be back.
i can see they are trying to take some care in preparation of the food. for example i had the philly cheesesteak and the meat was not dry or overcooked it wasnt rare but it was not all dried out. there were four of us and we each got something different and the common thing amongst all of them is there was way too much too much salt. enough for a salt mine. none of us could eat very much of any of it.
im probably not a fast food kinda person  still i was excited about us fries.  i love fries! security question what is your favorite food my answer is always french fries.  i suppose i should have asked if the french fries were hand cut fresh on site before going.  still im thinking if your name is us fries you should be the master of all things fries. i suspect the fries are made from frozen product bought in bulk. fresh or frozen the fries are almost tasteless. i went with a friend from canada who is always asking for brown gravy, she misses the poutine of her youth. i couldnt wait to take her to us fries. she was over the moon with her meal. this is the first time ive witnessed her eating all of her food.  she really liked it. she also likes dennys, golden corral buffet and processed cheese food. she loves meat and more meat. im a vegetarian who has hosted french fry bars, fresh hand cut potatoes fried to a gold brown with soft creamy centers, so yummy! points of reference to gauge how your palate might relate.bottom line would i go back? maybe to accompany a friend, otherwise no way.
went today for a late lunch, i ordered the cheeseburger poutine and my bf ordered pork 3 ways poutine. the staff was friendly and the food came out fast. it looked really yummy but i just didnt like mine: either the meat or the cheese had a weird smell to it. guessing the beef since my bfs food smelled fine. i dont think it was spoiled or anything, just cookedseasoned different than i cook mine. my food was really salty too. i ate about 7 bites and called it quits. gave the rest to a sweet homeless man outside who started devouring it immediately. my bf finished his food and said it was pretty good, but his stomach hurt him for a good while afterwards cause its definitely not easy to digest with all the salt and fat. my review is solely based on the cheeseburger poutine i liked the fries and pickles!, im open to try a different menu item another time. poutine isnt for me, but im glad i tried it!
over priced if you do the custom option you pay for everything.. each roping, bun, sauce, cheese.. then there are premium topping that cost even more. if you order off the menu you are still looking at a 12 burger with no fries those are 3 more.the service it was ok. nothing special but no problems either. the food again didnt leave me wanting to come back for the price. no special favors. location the inside is great. clean its new it should be. huge down fall they do not validate parking! if you come and meet some one for lunch you are in 6 if you park at city scape so try for a meter.
so finally 50 n central avenue has a new tenant, the counter. open daily.the counter offers sandwiches, salads, shake shake shakes, booze, and buildyourowngrilled cheese for 8, but the champions are the burgers.  offering an incentive to have your burger and eat it too, they sell on average for 1213, but if you buildyourown and indulge in extra fixins, youll be lighter 1213 minimum.all the favorites from fast foodsandwich shoppes are combined onto one menu. from regular ingredients to premium choices, from natural to organic. currently the offerings are 3 patty sizes; beef patties, tuna, turkey, or chicken; 20 flavors of cheese slices or spreads; over 25 types of relish, mustard, salsa, aioli, vinaigrette, or other dressings option to purchase a flight of 3; 40 different toppings of veggies, pickled stuffs, chili, meats; 8 types of buns; and 3 sides consisting of various fries, salads, veggies, and chili. word to the wise, if youre an office folk whos only allotted a set number of minutes to eat at midday, download the 15 page menu from the website and give it a looksee in advance because after youve made your choices and go through the required 6step byob process youll already need to head back to the office.1. choose your burger2. choose your cheese3. choose your sauce4. choose your toppings5. choose your bun6. choose your sidestill want to eat here?i do! their sign clearly reads the counter custom built burgers and one day i want to be the idiot who goes all veggie on em. veg up, b!tches. unfortunately, it hasnt happen yet because on the afternoon that i went there was no takeout. huhhh? i was told they were only fulfilling eatin orders because things got too confusing and they couldnt handle both.okay, now im confused. theyve opened a restaurant downtown, directly adjacent to the jefferson  1st ave metro stop, it was lunch time, and they were not fulfilling takeout orders.wow. wow.uh, wow.okay, ill try back later.hope yall are still in business...
okay burgers. took forever to get our order. i wouldnt have minded if the meal was amazing but it wasnt anything special. dont go here if you have limited time for lunch.
good food but slow and somewhat rude service, high prices and really loud noise level we sat next to each other at the counter and had to shout make me give it only 2 stars. the delicious sciracha sp? fries are what kicked it up to 2 stars from 1. wont go back im afraid.
been wanting to try this spot since it opened and finally go the opportunity today.  was hoping for a better experience as i live and work downtown.  the food was good but very expensive for what you get.  all sandwiches are al carte so sides are extra.  plan on spending a minimum of 10 for a burger or chicken sandwich and then another 3 for a side.  the place was busy so i sat at the bar.  i had the byo build your own chicken sandwich.  they didnt tell me i needed to fill out the menu form in order to put my order in.  in fact, i was ignore for the first ten minutes i sat there waiting for someone to acknowledge me.  once i got my drink, i filled out the order form and then waiting another 5 minutes for the bartender to pick it up and put the order in.  i had to flag him down for this.  my food came out rather quickly and it was good.  the sweet potato frys where ok but i only got half an order as the server who brought them out spilled half on the floor.  he offered to bring me more but at this point i was running out of time.  the chicken sandwich was good and there are quite a few toppings to choose from on the byo.  another pet peeve of mine is when i am not offered a refill on my drink.  my water glass was empty for half the meal and the bartender never acknowledged or even asked if i needed anything else. i attempted to get his attention but was ignored.  i also had to ask another server to ring up the check as the bartender also failed to pick up my bill and credit card which was laying in plain view.after tax and tip, the bill was over 16 dollars and i only drank water i believe there are better value restaurants in the downtown area with better food and lower prices and much better service.
i should preface this review by stating that this is purely based on customer service not the the food. the food at the counter is excellent, which, is the only reason i keep giving it the benefit of the doubt. unfortunately after another bad experience i finally decided to write a review.myself and some of my coworkers have been to the counter a hand full of times since theyve opened because of the delicious food. we have experienced long waits, missing food, over charges, under charges, and poor managerial intervention. as i mentioned before, today was the straw that broke the camels back, as they say. due to our past experiences we decided to call ahead and place our order in an attempt to alleviate the long waits and confusion at the bar. we were told it would be ready in 1015 mins. we waited 15 mins before we left the office, then walked the 5 mins it takes to get to the restaurant, and low and behold our food was still not ready. the dining room was not crowded and there we only a couple people at the bar so the hostess said itd be right up. another 15 mins later the food was still not out so the hostess checked and said it was being packed up. while we were waiting, a customer came up to the bar with their to go order that was wrong and they somehow were able to cook her a new order and send her on her way, all while our food was being packed up. when our order finally came out we decided to check it. there werent  any sauces for the burgers, a side of fries was missing, one sandwich was missing bacon, and one had extra toppings that were not ordered. we crossed checked the receipts and all were exactly what we ordered but not sure where the confusion came it should also be noted that we all ordered different burgers. once the staff fixed everything and we got back to our office, we finally the tasted the food, which was great, but this time that wont be enough to keep us coming back for more...
service was bad. server kept blaming it on the bartender and cooks....im talking  about 4 different times throughout our terrible experience. the drinks took 15 min to come and were wrong when they arrived. i ordered a michelada with a salted rim and was given a mimosa with a salted rim. then, yet again, the server blamed the bartender. the server brought me my drink. he should know what a michelada looks like compared to an orange bubbly mimosa. my husbands bloody pig bloody mary with bacon was in a huge 24 oz glass...full to the rim with what tasted like v8. there was very little ice and one lonely little piece of bacon floating around in it. im guessing there must have been 1oz of vodka in there somewhere too although im not sure. the server recommended asking them to make it short next time. cmon. if youre going to throw something like that on the menu, require its done right from the start. the drink was crap. the 15 bison burger was 4 bites for my husband. sides must be added for 3 each, no burger or sandwich comes with fries. the place was dead when we stopped in for dinner and it took 40 minutes then get food on the table. my grilled cheese w bacon was all bread with cheese that had already returned to its hard greasy been sitting out for a while under the lamp stage. i ordered blue cheese on my side salad and it was brought with ranch with blue cheese crumbled added because they dont have blue cheese uh, ok. i liked the fried pickles, thats about it and its a cute place. we wont be returning.
last updatewent to the counter to give it another shot on sunday 1227. we arrived shortly after their opening at 11am and found that they dont open at 11. apparently the website has not been updated there are no hour signs on the business and after looking at reviews, you really should call ahead to find out if theyre open or not. not a problem, we walked around until they eventually opened at 12.as i was sitting there at our table, i overheard the table behind me asking the server a question. the table was asking if there was a good time to come for lunch because when he stopped by the previous week, they were advised it would be an hour wait to put an order in. i had to chuckle to myself. based on my previous experience and other reviews, apparently things have not been addressed. i understand the occasional rush that youre not prepared for, but when it is the norm, there is a problem. the server advised the table that they can try on thursday...lol.now the part that counts, how was the food? it was really good! we ordered two burgers, two sides, one adult shake, and one normal shake. food quality is really good, the cost is high opinion, but definitely no complaints on taste. the counter has been open for long enough to work out the bugs, and hasnt. the novelty of a new place downtown will wear off and unless they address some of the serious shortfalls, i cannot imagine it can survive. the gm contacted me yesterday and was very pleasant. he explained the situation, explained steps to address it, and convinced me to try it again. although i still havent tasted the food, the menu looks great and numerous friends have vouched for the quality of the food.
came across this place while we were downtown, my boyfriend loves burger places and wanted to check it out, so we did. we both ordered the bacon bbq burger, chili cheese fries, a side order of regular and sweet potato fries as well. our burgers came out before of chili cheese fries which was fine, but with the amount of fries in that bowl, we definitely expected more toppings, so that was a fail. our burgers were too over cooked eventhough we asked for medium rare but i guess burger places just cant make it medium rare anymore, only thing i really loved about the burger was the bbq sauce, which was on the side, oddly and the onion rings in it. our side order of fries actually tasted better than the chili cheese one, guess you cant really go wrong with just fries though.  ultimately we werent big fans of this place, definitely over priced for what we got.
nothing very special and way too expensive for what it is.  the food wasnt bad, just nothing impressive and very fast foodlike for the price.  they had many different salsas to try which is kinda neat. the service was good. just would like to spend money like that elsewhere.
my first visit here was pleasant. the owner im assuming fixed my messed up nails i had gotten done in california and i loved it! told myself this was going to be my new go to! not only is it down the street from me, but they close very late which is a plus for me!however, the second time i went, which was a week after my first visit, i had the worse experience ever! came in for a pedicure and they sat me down within a few minutes. the lady who did my pedicure told me shed be back in a few minutes cause she had to drop her kids off at home. ummm okay... i decided to let it slide since i figured it should be too long, but i decided to keep count on how long it took her. okay, 30 ish minutes later she gets back. wtf! you made me wait 33 minutes so you can drop someone off at home? thats insane! to make matters worst, the time she was gone, there was another lady in a skirt standing around not doing anything. i figured she might be a friend or something and doesnt work there. boy was i wrong! after finishing up my pedicure, i see the lady in a skirt turning on the water and helping someone out with a pedicure. sooooo why did i wait 30 minutes when theres someone there who could have clearly done mine?! on top of that, my pedicure lasted about 20 minutes and she barely scrubbed my feet. not too sure if ill ever be back! like i said, the only good thing is they close late and the owner is good with fills.
looking forward to trying it again in about a month. hoping they can make some changes before i go back. when we got there about 6:45pm they had run out of bbq, except for chicken. so i had me some chicken. i give the chicken 5 stars; it was absolutely delicious, and priced fairly 12 lb for 8. so, they have at least one main dish right. the rest of my experience was lackluster. heres what went wrong: issues: staff unorganized. this is not the fault of the staff; this is a management issue. why open a place if its not organized? they ran out of bbq! i know its cheaper to run out than it is to make a little extra, but it isnt very nice for the customer to only have one option side dishes were good green chili macncheese, and coleslaw, but severely overpriced. those two sides cost us 6 and the portions were really small. suggestion: if you are going to have small side dishes, just include it with the main course instead of jabbing everyone for every morsel on their plate.the bar didnt have basic liquors; just knock off brands. also, whats a bbq place without beer on tap? when we placed our order at the counter the process was not organized.  pet peeve: hate it when i stand in line to order and the receipt i am supposed to sign has a line for a tip. i like to have my food served before i issue a tip. isnt the reward supposed to come after the service? im going to give this place another go in a month or so. if they can make a few corrections it could go from below average to great. in my opinion theres alot of work needed to achieve that goal. i want it to work. we need a great bbq place in these parts. need a lesson on how? go have a meal at little miss bbq in south phoenix. people stand in line there for the privilege of having great bbq because its that darned good.
the bbq was ok, not bad but nothing special.  the portions were small and the sides are ridiculously over priced.  9 for large fries??!  the way the food is brought out to the the tables is fairly inefficient... they bring out each item one at a time, wandering the restaurant like a lost child, with no idea whose food is whose calling out the names of the patrons.  you can imagine what this is like when the restaurant is busy, or when there are multiple customers with the same name.
average at best. i had to bring a point to the attention of the owner before any action was taken. employees look confused. ordered tritip and brisket. brisket was a good, soft and moist piece from the flat and had good flavor, but hardly any bark. maybe 5 minutes over cooked. as for the tritip, theirs should be called drytip. obviously cooked at high temp for short time, no rendered fat goodness, just giant chewy chunks and ribbons of fat. someone needs to turn in their bbq card cause if you cant do a tri then i have absolutely no respect for you. tri tip is one of the tastiest on the cow, yet this had zero flavor and zero bark.may as well have been a 3 day old leftover from the fridge that you snack on. mac n cheese was the best part.overall i rank frashers on a famous daves level of bbq. definitely not a place you show up early to or stand on line for. pricing should be 2 dollars less, mine were 14 pound each and were 6 sandwiches, not 8 and 9 respectively. mac side was 3 and should be 2. so, if youre passing by and it looks empty you may want to try for yourself, but i do not recommend. so there you have it folks.
stay away from the brisket and burt ends. the brisket is all meat no char and no fat. the burt ends is all fat. the chicken is good and green chili mac and cheese is ok. unless you are craving chicken i find it not worth the 5 minute trip from the office.
ive been to frashers twice now.on my first visit i ordered the burnt ends. they were extremely flavorful, smokey and fatty but an order consisting entirely of burnt ends is a bit overpowering.the green chili mac and cheese was solid though. on my second visit burnt ends werent ready yet; however brisket was. hrmmm dont you cut the burnt ends off first?? i ordered the brisket and found it had zero bark as they say they cut it off to make the burnt ends. the brisket was extremely rubbery, and given that burnt ends werent available at opening time i highly suspect i was either eating yesterdays brisket or they dont know how to properly smoke a brisket. given the high prices, and the poor meat cook i cant recommend this place. hopefully they can improve because i really wanted to like the place.
i have a smoker and know what good bbq is.  this is not good bbq.  i realize this place just opened review maybe to early.  had the burnt ends , pieces were really chopped, it was flavorful but not great.  pulled pork was avg.  i felt the inside had no flow, and was kind of dirty.   i will review this place again.
as described before the opening, this is a more casual version of frashers steakhouse complete with plastic utensils and a place your order at the counter routine, but with the same steakhouselike higher prices.. the menu is also lacking most of the favorite midwest food items the former restaurant had now i have nowhere but st louis to go to eat imos or toasted ravs! i ordered a small portion of average brisket and a side for around 20  i dont think ill be returning.. too much competition in this neighborhood to deal with minimal options, a pricey menu married with a super casual, dark environment. giving two stars for the attentive customer service, but i cant say i prefer the food, menu or restaurant atmosphere.
second time i have been here and i probably wont make a 3rd visit unfortunately. i am a mac and cheese lover and theirs just doesnt cut it. for one it tasted like cheeseless velveta. it was super runny and had no cheddar or real cheese taste. one would think they would use a beschamel and a trio of cheeses and maybe bake it with a crumbly topping.. nope. just plain and bland. the i got the burnt ends today which was prepared like greasy carnitas is. the pork was fatty and greasy and ive had a stomach ache all day. would love to offer some recipe tips cause the decor is great, friendly attentive staff, and the owner is always there walking around. we have tried the pulled pork and brisket in the past and that was sub par as well. such a shame too.
good bbq but not great. in the sea of mediocre bbq places this fits right in. i love good bbq but i dont think i would bother going back to eat here on my own. 2.5 is the best score i could give this place.
today my wife and i tried frashers for the 2nd time. we were disappointed once again. we really wanted to like the food because the place looks nice and its comfortable. youll notice that most of the pictures are of the decor not the food. its a little expensive for bbq which i wouldnt mind if the food were good.i hope the owners and managers pay attention to the negative reviews because the preslicing of meat and the steam table is sucking the true flavor from the meat. i had a 3 meat platter with tri tip, brisket and ribs. the ribs had a little smoke flavor but were dry from being sliced ahead of time and the bark had little flavor. that was the good part, the brisket and tri tip had no flavor at all. the steam table had sucked all the flavor from the beef. there was no bark on either meat, im sure its at the bottom of the steam pan. my wife had pulled pork and it was dry and had no flavor either. the sides were ok, we had frys and slaw this time. the mac and cheese was pretty good when we tried it the first time we tried frashers. owners please slice to order. the better bbq places like bryans, little miss, or pork on fork all slice to order and it makes a huge difference. im sure you have great flavor when the meat comes off the smoker, i would really like to taste it. good luck, i hope you can make some changes to improve the food. my bbq friends and i will be waiting and watching we want to see you make it.
i was a fan of their prime rib, which is not yet available at this new venue.pleasant enough surrounding for bbq with ordering from a knowledgeable young girl and delivery to your table.  the owner does circulate, which is a nice touch.based on previous reviews i tried the burnt ends and they had good not excellent flavor. i thought the portion was small and their sides are ridiculously small and priced much too high, which seems to be the norm for bbq restaurants. all in all not a bargain and for the price would expect significantly better. all in all will not try again, unless he starts serving the same prime rib he did at his long standing location on scottsdale road.
i dont even know what to say.  breaded  chicken wings?  glad they served celery and carrots.  plastic utensils?  either your in or your not.  if i want to eat with plastic ill go to a food truck.   jenn was awesome. she made a nice drink.  cant say ill be back anytime soon unless babe drags me along.
order at the counter and they bring the food out to you.shared the 12 beef brisket,  12 lb pulled pork, baby back ribs, corn and jalapeno mac and cheese.the brisket is good, but does not stand out, the pulled pork is a better choice and the baby back ribs are a keeper. there are alot of great bbq places in phoenix and this is not one of them.would rather spend my money at a couple other bbq places
tried this place for the first time this week. needed a break from the usual biltmore corridor fare. someone threw out the idea of bbq and this was closest. large place, lots of seating at booths or tables seat yourself clean, dark and casual. sparsely decorated with no real theme or atmosphere and a couple of tvs playing quietly. you order at the counter and they bring it to your table. meats come unsauced and they have three or four different sauces at a central counter you help yourself to. crowd was sparse and a mix of suits and uniforms  service was friendly and competent and they explained how to order since it was our first time. my lunch mate had the pulled pork sandwich which is simply meat in a bun and a side of green chili mac and cheese. i had a two meat combo with brisket and tritip and the mac on the side and ordered a slice of the gooey butter cake for us to share. combo comes with texas toast. pulled pork was excellent, smoky and well cooked. the brisket and tritip were ok, not horrible, not memorable and all my food, including the toast, was room temperature and dry. mac and cheese are individual not suitable for sharing as an fyi a la carte portions and was tasty and heated through. drinks are also self service and the ice tea was fresh and it appears they have beer, wine and cocktails. my lunchmate noted that the choices are white and red and are 9 a glass, cocktails are 7 and beers are 5, going on memory. combined this very simple meal was about 35.00 and frankly for that much was not comparable to what youd get for the same money at many other places in the area, for instance at osho a short distance away that serves really great hit and juicy pulled pork, brisket and pastrami sandwiches with good sides in a slightly nicer environment, or for that matter hillstones at the biltmore, where we could have eaten for a comparable cost.
very unimpressed especially after seeing this restaurant has 4 stars! the only decent thing we had were the baby back ribs. other than that the pulled pork was beyond dry and had an old taste, brisket was also dry, mac and cheese was overcooked and watery not cheesy i would have rather had kraft mac and cheese and the corn definitely came from a can and also sat way too long until it was soggy. basically everything has clearly been sitting in warmers all day and not at all fresh. i dont think ill be going back.
a little disappointed and underwhelmed with quality and taste of food. ordered the 3 meat combo with 2 sides pork ribs, brisket, pulled pork; green chile mac n cheese and corn. first the good: the pork ribs and brisket was decent not great. service was fine and place was clean.the bad:pulled pork was dry and tasted  looked as if sitting out for hours. mac n cheese tasted watered down and overcooked...the cheese sauce was thin and did not taste much like cheese at all...like if you watered down velveeta 1 part cheese and 4 parts water. yuck. then threw a can of chiles in it. next the corn was chewy and tasted like frozen corn that has been overcooked in a pot all day.overall just not great food. rudys is better i think...and that isnt saying a whole lot.i wanted to like this place. the dogs will love it however. bringing home all of the pulled pork to feed them.
mehhh! was totally disappointed. first off, the service was sad. i asked about the size of their chicken wings..the guy taking my order said the size of chicken wings ill pass on the side of smart a thanks. just a bad attitude. but, on to the food. my mouth was sexy for some good ole bbq!! i ended up giving my dry chicken and fries to the homeless lady outside..along with their soupykraft macaroni macncheese. but, the cornbread was decent.mehh! wont go back.
we tried the curry leaf last weekend and it was just okay. not bad but not the tastiest indian food i have had. we ordered the rogan josh lamb, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala and korma lamb. the food smelled divine but the taste was somewhat lacking. the meat in the chicken dishes was tender and well cooked. the meat in the rogan josh and the korma tasted like mutton dressed like lamb. kind of old and tough. they are a new restaurant and i wish them luck.
if any of the reviewers had ever tasted genuine indian food, theyd soon realise this isnt a 4.5 restaurant. tandoori lamb chops, didnt taste of tandoori and came with a rationed amount of sauce. lamb saag was bright green and a runny sauce instead of being naturally coloured by the spinach and should be a much thicker consistency. tikka masala was average. garlic naan was actually really nice though.
overall this was a disappointing experience  everything fell a little flat. there are better indian places in vegas. decor: fantastic. i really liked the layout and ambiance. the furniture was modern and the decorators did a nice job of making this look like an indian bistro. great photos on the walls and the wine rack over the bar on the wall was nice. service: meh... attentiveness was fine, she didnt communicate well any answers to questions we asked. cocktails: this is where the majority of points were lost. first of all, dont have any of the cocktails. the server lost points for not being able to describe in greater detail a drink i got that had a masala seasoning to it with tequila. i asked if it was served up or on the rocks and she said on the rocks. out came what could be described as salty, room temperature, tequila masala broth with no tequila taste with two floating frozen cat testicles for ice cubes. not sure what they were supposed to be, but this drink was absolutely horrid. usually, i lower my gaze and bite the bullet on something i order, but this one was a for sure send back. my alternate drink was a jameson and ginger ale  they had no ginger ale. le sigh my dining partner got a mojito with curry leaf  rum, curry leaf, and soda  no flavor whatsoever. the waitress was cool with taking my drink off the menu, but we pushed through the mojito and just stuck to nothing unique for the rest of the meal.food: average. plating was nice, portions were good, everything was just a little less good than ive had in several other indian venues in vegas. appetizer was a three skewered chicken dish  great for two people. a little inconsistent on the cook of the meat, but nothing raw. lamb saag and chicken tikka masala were the entrees with jeera aloo and garlic naan. everything was edible but just flat; not good enough to return. we came based on the reviews and wont return instead choosing one of three other places that do everything except decor better.
im not sure if theres something wrong with me, if it was an off day, or if everyone else has low donut standards, but i didnt think these donuts were all that. the husband and i excitedly drove up to northern perks on a sunday morning to get some supposedly delicious donuts and coffee. we arrived and immediately felt a little disappointed... the shop itself was nothing terribly special and the case of donuts didnt have much out of the ordinary either at least these days when many other donut shops are stepping up their creativity game . the husband got a fruit loops donut, i got a cronut, we got the bacon maple to go and a coffee. let me say, the ladies who work there were very nice and helpful. heres the rundown:coffee they have a few different varieties. the husband got the regular coffee and poured cream in it from the carafe. unfortunately, i dont think it was cream  or milk  as the coffee looked like it had chunks of white stuff in it, i thought possibly bad milk... it was pretty gross looking, but the husband said it tasted ok and he thought maybe it was just coffee mate powder mixed with water. either way, not having cream or milk out for coffee is ridiculous. cronut  this thing was greasy and the filling was flavorless.... the redeeming quality? the strawberry on top... but there was only one slice... and it didnt save this dessert. this is a sad version of what could be so good. bacon maple  also greasy, left a weird taste in your mouth... wasnt nearly as good as bacon maples from other local establishments see welcome donut, oink, etc. so, im not sure if it was a bad day, which i hope it was, but im also not sure ill be back to find out.
i walked in at 7:45 pm. 15 minutes before closing, i wasnt expecting great service since it was so close to closing time. the lady upfront was super passive aggressive! she rolled her eyes when i told her it was my first time in, due to the fact that its more paperwork on her end. she didnt even make eye contact with me! the nurse and practitioner where really nice and got me in an out within 15 minutes!
awful, slow and indifferent service.   it was the middle of the afternoon!  3 other people.  wingz were just ok.  had much better.
i dont ever try a restaurant until theyve been open for 6 months.  i didnt realize theyve only been open a week.  i walked in  had no idea where to go  all the customers are looking at me.  finally i see 3 different areas to maybe order.  i wanted a to go order.  placed my order, watched 3 different people walk out, seen people who clearly came in after me get food before mine which i know for sure 1 family did not call ahead, watched countless people come in like i did not knowing where to go  no one helping them, asking when my order will be ready which they answered soon an hour  a half later my order of 18 wings  fries were ready!  there were countless unhappy people wondering where their food was.  i know its new  need to work the bugs out.  i liked the remodeling job.  the wait staff needs to be trained as to how far behind the kitchen is  let the customers know so we would have had the choice to not wait so long.  later we found out the restaurant didnt expect so much business with the packer game  had to get the wings from the freezer which in turn made them have to cook longer.  i counted 6 fryer baskets  2 were empty.  not sure on their system for cooking but i know most people were waiting over an hour!   as for when you go in there, the wait staff either needs to acknowledge you no matter where they are in the restaurant it is small in there, have a hostess or have a sign please wait.  the wings were good.  the wait staff also could wear whatever they want.  i think they at least should have a wingz n thingz tshirts on in the least so i knew who to talk to.  i think after a few or many complaints they will get the bugs worked out  i think it will be a goldmine!  i will definitely be back but i will ask how long  the wait is  i will definitely wait 6 months to try again!
service was okay but confusing. all servers were nice but not necessarily good at providing service. wasnt sure who to talk to upon arrival and was not sure where to pay. beer list was impressive, but they were out of some of the good ones. this is a soft opening, so understandable if things are out of stock due to more business than expected.food: boneless wings kung pao tasted like overprocessed frozen meat. they were like breaded chicken meatballs with lackluster sauce. the traditional wings i had bourbon bbq sauce were much better, but still pretty blah. mozzarella sticks could have come off the swans truck. cheese curds were good and the only thing my party of four speculated we would return for.the place was cute. nice job on the remodel. the tv placement is strange  would be better to spread them out a bit instead of all three right next to each other so more patrons would have a view.what i couldnt get over was how dirty the place was. maybe theyve been so busy that they havent had a chance to procure a mop.  they should. my shoes stuck to the floor. there was visible grime throughout the seating area.  the bathroom womens at least was disgusting and cold. if the frontofhouse was so poorly cleaned i dont want to imagine what the kitchen looks like.
i figured with the focus on chicken it would be amazing! i will say the sauces are good! i dont understand when you order to go why you cant get naked boneless wings and order sauce to try  makes no sense. the boneless wings were nothing more than chicken nuggets with pressed meat gross. the regular wings were decent  the bipolar not hot at all and they charge more is dumb.
it was lucky to get two stars out of me because the crab cakes were good. however, the atrocious service we received was mindboggling. one hour and twenty minutes and we werent served our dinners. i didnt order anything fancy, just stuffed chicken breast. highly unlikely we are going to return.
walked in with a reservation, and the host was awol. finally he showed and waited another 15min even with a reservation. once seated, there was 78 tables open. ordered bread..which they charge for 8 tiny wedges of bread the spinach dip came out fast than the bread...15 min again. ordered two wedge salads....45 min and still not brought out. you get the picture. the food was good. the service is totally crap. not acceptable for a high end restaurant charging what they do for service this poor.
had dinner here with my boss last night. we both had the dry aged filets  about 50 each. i was somewhat put off by the waitress... she was friendly, but we sat down, she explained wet and dry steak preparation. her explanation was so robotic. immediately following, she asked if we were ready to order. we both said no as we hadnt even opened the menus yet. she told us to flag her down when we were ready. she did come back to check on us, but for what appeared to be a higher end and priced restaurant was odd that the service didnt match. i dont ever flag down a waitress.  we both ordered dry aged filets cooked medium. he got medium rare id say more rare and i got well. he said the asparagus was good. i had the garlic mashed potatoes and wasnt impressed at all. it was so oily and i loooove mashed potatoes.  he also ordered a house salad which never came. when the food runner came with our meals my boss mentioned he ordered a salad and the man was quick to go grab the salad. the waitress came and apologized and said she wouldnt charge him for the salad. well done! we ate, waited and waited for the bill. were never checked on and both had empty drinks during the meal. got the bill, paid... as we are standing up,  they bring out his original salad. we are talking like 75 minutes from when it was ordered. both of us agreed it was alright,  but for 150 there is no way id return. maybe for happy hour with girl friends or something though! the restaurant was beautiful.
its a lovely restaurant and a welcome addition to the neighborhood, but there are some major flaws that need attention. but first kudos to larsens landscape architect who gave it the most attractive exterior with access to two levels of parking. as for the flaws, sadly, its the food that needs some attention if they want to keep guests coming back.  there are some important steps theyre skipping in the kitchen  most importantly tasting the food before it goes out. thats not happening. a tomato salad with three slices of tomato should have 3 perfect slices of the ripest, juiciest tomatoes ever  its summer, this isnt hard. but that didnt happen. they were mealy and tough  large, but totally inedible. the dish was billed as tomato and burrata salad but the cheese was plain old mozzarella  fresh yes, but not burrata. mac  cheese has promise texturally, but was flavorless  how is that possible? best dish was the steak sashimi  cooked rare with a nice sear and served over wasabi mash  but it was an app and there was enough mash for this to be a main for 2 easily, large enough to be an app for 4 handily. on the plus side: the meat was tender and flavorful plus overall, the dish was good and recommended by our server.tuna tartare was huge  well presented... but even as a lunch portion by itself, it was huge. and dots of siracha need to be brushes of it, it helps the whole dish, as would some lemon. tuna was okay, but cut in cubes so large, the mouth feel was off. there wasnt a balance between it and the avocado, but i will say that this was one great avocado. probably one of the best ive had in a while out   so why couldnt they ripen that tomato? rotisserie chicken had been sandbagged by the cook a while earlier  so that the skin was rubbery and gummy. sauce was strangely sweet. not good.  again the mash  and tons of it. only two spears of asparagus. nice fat ones, but still... i hadnt had chilean seabass in years because its not sustainable  but i was curious to see how they handled it. this dish too, was served on a sea of mash, plus the fish had a strange texture. the gold standard is nobu. and its been trickling downward for years onto chain menus. go try it, and youll see why yours is not up to par. i like that traditional steakhouses  grills are serving up lots of other options beyond simple steak. and dishes with sides already composed but enough with the mash.... it would be great if they stepped up and offered more organic options  but kudos for having one grassfed beef steak on the menu. they had some sushi  but here too, the portions were huge. i get that every restaurant in america thinks they have to compete with cheesecake factory and serve up portions that are enormous, but theres no need for it. i didnt get the sense that they had any gluten free options at all. i didnt even bother asking for a menu, but i think today, servers should take it upon themselves to find out when guests sit down if anyone at the table has any food allergies that the kitchen should be aware of. and every kitchen should be able to deliver at least two safe meal options  free of any potential allergens. even if there are only a few limited options, there should be at least two. and every server should know what they are. period. we ordered a ton of food because we like having a chance to get a feel for the place in one fell swoop  even though it typically freaks out the kitchen. but were flexible and not weirded out by timing  particularly when there seems to be thought put into it. so we asked them to send it out as it was ready  but the food came out so quickly without consideration of coursing appropriate dishes that we werent really able to enjoy what we already had on the table at proper temps or at a proper pace.  rookie mistake. so their solution? the table was too full  so clear dishes! so they tried with every pass  and they passed a lot to take the plates away. finally when we reached a stopping point, and were actually ready for some to be cleared because we were finally all complete, there was no one in sight, no one watching the table at all. and no one who noticed us trying to flag down anyone. poof. one other odd note: there are a lot of the same liquor bottles behind the bar all lit up intentionally  but instead of contributing to the design, it screamed sad chain with poorly stocked bar.and servers, please dont ask how are we tonight? how do we like our food? awkward. oh and one last note: aging beef  either wet or dry   does not increase beefs marbling. ever. when you say things like that to folks who know better, you immediately discredit yourself and the restaurant. i know, were tough. but we really want you to succeed. so sit down, taste the food  benchmark yourself against folks who are serving up dishes that youre serving and be honest about how your stack up.
we were so looking forward to a new good place in henderson.  but unfortunately, i doubt well be back.  the food was very disappointing.  we tried various things from salad to appetizers to the creamed spinach and none of it was very good.  they need a new chef.our waiter michael, however, was fabulous and would give him separately 5 stars.
smoothie was great.  service was lousy.  walked in the door at 11:43 am today.  order was not taken until 12:08 pm.  one worker left at noon leaving the other, a new hire, alone during the lunch rush.  the place was packed, at least 8 cars in the drivethru, and she had no help.  and she had to stop and count the money in her cash drawer.  where was her help?  where was the manager?  this poor gal did her very best.  the guy that left was supposed to have roasted bananas for their spiced pear smoothie but he did not so my son had to have his smoothie made with a plain banana...definitely will not go back!
they take forever!!!! make it wrong. have attitudes. jimmy is they guy to go to if you want something done right. this is the only close location to me and i hate coming here but its the only close one!!!!! the manager needs to visit more or something!
dd:  welcome to dunkin donuts,  may i take your order?me:  yes, one dozen donuts with hair dropped onto themdd:  no problem sir,  all of our donuts come with hair!
good coffee.  good donuts.  lousy service.  slow, indifferent.  waited long to get service while several employees stood nearby bsn and having a good time.  twice.probably will just pick up some kwik trip glazers and karuba.  just as good, cheaper and i can wait on myself faster.
went there today 62115 for lunch. stood awkwardly at the front for about 5 minutes before anyone could be bothered to take my order. i got a three piece chicken tender combo. when i hear combo i automatically think fries and a drink....not the case here. a combo is just the tenders,  fries, and cole slaw. i thought that was weird...especially since the combo was over 12.  so i got the combo with a root beer and asked for my fries loaded topped with sour cream, cheese, and bacon.  the total was almost twenty bucks...more than i want to spend for lunch.  the place was pretty busy and there were only four open tables but they were all dirty.  i just sat down anyways...cuz thats how i roll.  a little chicken crumbs never hurt anybody and i dont want to be that lady and ask to have the table wiped down.  these tenders were not good, yall.  yes they were fresh, they were hot, they were moist, but there is a weird dry rub on the outside and the inside is really bland.  i could easily make these in my kitchen.  they have many sauces to try to disguise their bland chicken:1 habanero hot sauce  just gross.  no tanginess at all...just sweet and slightly spicy.  skip it. i much prefer franks red hot or buffalo sauce. 2 barbecue standard barbecue sauce...tastes just like the kind you get at the grocery store. 3 wasabi honey this is literally wasabiflavored honey.  it is watery and disgusting and i dont know who in the world likes this. 4 wildflower honey once again....this is just plain honey.  who is dipping their chicken in honey?  this place doesnt even have biscuits so i dunno why they have honey. 5 chipotle barbecue see 2the coleslaw was awful.  i actually spit it out.  its just cabbage, carrots, and vinegar.  yuck.  the fries were delicious.  the root beer was delicious.  canes is about twenty times better and half the price.  i have no reason to go back here.  if i ever did end up back here id try something else...like maybe the wings or a sandwich.  the tenders are not worth it.update when i ate there i asked the cashier if i could substitute the cole slaw for the pickled cucumbers and i was denied but ive read a couple of yelp reviews where yelpers were allowed to do this.  eff you, too, blue ribbon chicken.  why wouldnt you let me?
let me start off by saying the staff here seemed very nice and the actual place itself is well designed. also, i understand they just opened but this wasnt really a quality issue as much as a quantity issue. however, the food or should i say the lack there of, was actually quite insulting. charging 8 for a small chicken finger on a bun and trying to pass it off as a chicken sandwich is downright criminal. worse? how about 7 for a large fries. yup... 7 for fries with no toppings or anything. just fries. plain fries. 7. for a portion size no bigger than you get in a large fries at mcdonalds. back to the sandwich... ordered the rancher which states bacon  ranch dressing. received 0 bacon. also had asked for no cucumbers but they were on there. this is ok actually as i mentioned they just opened and these are kinks that need to work out... im ok with that. not part of why i gave two stars... it only added to the frustration of the portion sizes and pricing.the taste was pretty good... enjoyed the fries more than the sandwich but that also may have been out of pure anger with the size of the sandwich. actually enjoyed the sauce options that i tried as well. the chipolte honey had a nice kick. maybe i was overhyped for this place? i see some folks enjoyed their meals. i felt robbed and wont be back until they fix the portion sizes. i have never been still hungry after an 8 sandwich and fries. wish them luck and hope they can fix these issues. they are in a great spot but will get smoked by shake shack opening up across the street if they do not fix some things and fix them soon.
very dry and chewy fried chicken. overpriced. super friendly people, great atmosphere. raising canes is by far superior as far as fried chicken goes. maybe this place should change their name to blue ribbon french fries. because those were delicious.
the skinny: did not enjoy the flavor of the seasoning on the fried chicken and the tenders. the tenders were also dry. sauces were largely one note and uninteresting 2.5 service:it is counter service but on the slower side 3 value: meh.... ive had better. pass on this place. 2.5coming off of restaurant week where we had some very good fried chicken,  we headed to blue ribbon to see what the fuss is all about. the hubs ordered the chicken tenders and the lunch box with wings. the lunch box comes with fries and coleslaw.the coating on the chicken is a bit weird. it is a bit too thick and is served overzealously with their poorly balanced spice blend the paprika i think is overwhelming. not a huge fan of this. the tenders were a trifle dry and the wings mutantly large fared better. the sauces seemed very interesting but in reality they are all one note... honey. i could not eat much of the wasabichipotlestraight up honey because i did not want to eat candied chicken. they are all way too sweet with the exception brbbq sauce which was acceptable but not exceptional. the containers for dipping sauce had such a narrow lip that it was hard to really dip anything in there. we ended up squeezing the sauce directly on the chicken making for very messy eating. the shoestring fries are okay   nothing to write home about. the coleslaw was too sweet for my tastes. he also ordered some gourmet soda and tried all the flavors while we waited. all of them were way too sweet in for both our tastes the hubs likes sweet too!. that didnt help with the entrees we ordered.overall,  we really wanted to be impressed by this place but it all fell flat. eh... would rather pay more for something better. 2.5 starred review.
i know other people have been raving about this place, but i dont really get it. and i love fried chicken!  ill get straight to the food, we got the 5 wing combo and the 2 boneless thigh combo.  the chicken was moist and the skin was crispy at least on the wings.  but there was a consistent lack of flavor in both the wings and the thighs.  i saw the famous seasoning dusted on the chicken, but it still lacked flavor.  the thigh and wing meat was also flavorless.  the wings are a better idea than the thighs.  the thighs are thick, meaning lots of flavorless chicken in between the fried coating.  and my thighs had a nice coating of oilgrease at the bottom that soaked through the brown tray, leaving the skin on the bottom of the thighs soggy.  we did not have this problem with the wings.  a positive is the portion size, very generous portion of chicken and fries.  the fries were nice and crispy shoe string fries, but the cole slaw side was forgettable.  the saving grace for the chicken is the dipping sauces available at the table chipotle honey, bbq, wasabi honey, honey, etc.  but i feel like good fried chicken should be able to stand alone and that was not the case.  i might give this place another shot later on, but i was sorely disappointed on my first visit.
wow! 16.75 for a three chicken tender lunch and a soda???  the tenders were tasty, tender and juicy and the service  staff were absolutely spectacular cruising the dining area and checking in.  i dont mind pricey lunches but i have to say this meal was about 45 over priced especially for a counter service joint.  the same meal at bjs with four tenders is about 12 max.  too bad for their hard working staff and customers.
the fried chicken and fries were pretty good. the place was very clean. the staff very friendly. but the explicit, blaring rap music was terrible. how do u play music with bitch, n, s and the f bomb in a public restaurant? the same 3 songs played over and over. does jayz own this place? the manager said its a tape that is preloaded and they are just instructed to play it. they have no control over content. if i go back there i will get it to go. couldnt evenfinish my meal, it was that bad.
i thought id give this a try after all the hype. did not make the grade. the chicken had little flavor except for the overly zealous paprika seasoning. the gravy for the mashed potatoes was oily. was way overpriced for fried chicken.  a positive note: chicken was moist and the mashed potatoes were authentic.
first experience today and i am hoping it will be better the next time .prices are in the high side but the food was well prepared . ill try other items next time .
after all the hype, my expectations were pretty high. what we got was in a word... bland. hyped up, dry, absolutely tasteless chicken. tasteless corn side dish. tasteless mashed potatoes and gravy. the good thing is that you can mask the tastelessness with the sauces they provide at each table. ready for more bad news? the french fries were pretty good. the prices are insane. 60 for me, my wife, and a baby. for 60 we got water to drink, a total of 4 chicken tenders, and 3 wings. on the upside, the french fries were okay.raising canes is probably a better alternative on every level.its better than mcdonalds which is why this didnt get one star. as another reviewer noted, the skinny french fries were pretty good. they should change their name to blue ribbon french fries.
chickfila please come and save lasvegas . the food looked better than it tasted . just a personal opinion . clean cool store
ate here last night. attractive place and friendly staff. however the food was disappointing. it was not the crispy crunchy  chicken described on their website home page. we had the tenders and there was no crunch at all. the seasoning is interesting but not anything id want again. the choices of only tenders wings and thighs was surprising. what about breasts and drumsticks?  when i got back on line i discovered that the nyc location has these plus several other sides not offered here. i feel cheated as maybe its better at their nyc location but i wont come back to this one.  as others have said, way too expensive for what you get.
the highlights were  the trash compactor and creme soda....otherwise a complete waste of time!
extra star is for decor. mediocore taste in chicken. ok tasting fries, overpriced overall due to location. no soap in restroom, also not spotless clean. average tasting soda
flavors were ok but just like everyones gripe is the price, be prepared to break the bank with this hidden chicken joint!came in to an empty restaurant around 4pm, caught off guard as i wouldve thought that would be their big rush? i guess this worked out well in my favor seeing how the time for order to eating would probably be greatly increased if it were packed.i and the girlfriend ordered the 2 piece dark combo and the blue ribbon chicken sandwich with sweet tea.the girl behind the cash register said 25 dollars with a straight face and said it would take about 15 minutes. i swiped my card and proceeded to grab a seat in the desolate dining area. when my buzzer finally rang after what had seemed a lifetime, i walked up to the counter.i ordered dine in yet i still received a nicely designed paper bag with their logo, i guess to advertise the 10 foot walk from counter to table? i sat down opened up the bag yet to pull out another paper bag containing my food and soaked in grease. the portions were delightfully small in terms of the actual chicken and cole slaw, yet swamped with skinny fries screaming too much salt. the chicken had a decent seasoning bit salty and crunch yet was just lacking proper amount for price. all the sauces offered were horrendous besides the habanero saucethis was oh so good. read my tip on the sweet tea, its over priced and falsely advertised. also i didnt order this but i did notice 5 pints of pbr! seriously? i can buy a lifetime supply of pbr for that price.all in all the flavors were just ok nothing that screamed come back for more, specially from a place specializing in chicken? step your game up blue ribbon and maybe we will come back!  i see why the place is so empty now. ill walk next door to public school instead.
my daughter and i stopped in to try this new spot in downtown summerlin for a quick meal. this is a fairly new business and i was anxious to try as dts posted an amazing, yummy looking photo on instagram earlier that day made my mouth water.i ordered the blue ribbon chicken sandwich what they are known for which i felt was really overpriced at approximately 6.79 and i made it a combo which included fries, cole slaw and a drink add on another 2.50. my daughter ordered the kids meal which was one chicken tender with fries at over 5. we were given a pager that would tell us when our food was ready. i found their prices to be a bit high for a fast food joint.we walked over to the soda machine which by the way they have their own soda which is cane soda. my daughter chose the root beer, which neither of us really liked. we found a table to sit at and there were probably about three tables with people sitting and eating. i noticed the sauces on the table which i would learn i would need to use in order to give this chicken any taste.our food arrived in about ten minutes and was delivered by one of the staff who was very nice. i was excited to try my sandwich and decided to try the honey chipotle sauce. i took my first bite and was immediately disappointed. there was really no flavor to the chicken even with their special sauce and the honey chipotle. the bun was soft and the veggies were fresh but i have had better chicken sandwiches elsewhere! there was a generous serving of shoestring fries which were hot and crispy. the meal also came with cole slaw which had a weird vinegar taste....not my style.i would like to thank the young man who came by a couple of times to check on us and to see if we needed anything. he also promptly cleared our table when we were done. he was the highlight of our visit and deserves to be commended for providing great service.perhaps i picked an off day as i had planned on this meal being delicious, but instead i will stick with popeyes or canes for good chicken at a decent price!
items selected:nutella, vanilla, and caramel shakeshush puppiessmorgasbird  lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, chicken cutlets, pineapple slices, pickles, fries, sour cream, cheddar cheese, bacon, sauteed bbq chicken, pickled peppers2 strips, 2 wingsadobo corncollards  baconfounded by the bromberg brothers and featuring the duos first foray into the burbs, blue ribbon fried chicken arrived in downtown summerlin by way of new york earlier this summer and although the quick casual concept has been questioned for high prices as well as uneven cooking ever since opening it was with a friend and his child that i sat down for lunch on saturday, almost every offputting rumor soon confirmed.nicely lit and well adorned with amenities including motion sensing trash compactors, lcd televisions, housemade sauces, plus a fountain featuring artisan sodas from boylans, a visit to blue ribbon begins at a counter with smiling servers  the dining decisions largely sandwiches, combos, and sides with additional options for shakes or salads, plus single tenders, wings, or thighs.taking note of a few specials, the augustonly smorgasbird with a portion of the proceeds benefiting  multiple sclerosis offered in addition to perplexingly priced hush puppies  3.75 for a halfdozen or 7.95 for ten  it was after some perusal that an order soon completed, the fifteen minute wait with one of those vibrating flashy buzzers spent sitting in one of several unpadded booths.certainly not a cheap meal, the total before tax and tip north of 55 for what would prove less than enough to sate a family of four were it not for the three excellent pieces of egg bread wrapped around the charitable sandwich, it was largely a matter of principle that the smorgasbird was ordered and with two boneless cutlets spiced quite unlike the bromberg chicken at blue ribbon or brooklyn bowl suffice it to say that each piece was almost too dry on its own to be enjoyable, the better bites found in barbequed bits serve atop cheesy fries tinged in peppers while anemic looking tomatoes made one question sourcing during the ingredients peak time of year.finding the tenders to be as oddly spiced and devoid of moisture as the cutlets while wings at least maintained their texture thanks to the presence of a bone, it was onward to sides that the meal progressed and although the hushpuppies were each quite small the flavors of sweet corn were thankfully prominent, the same not to be said of soft collards barely bolstered by pork let alone the adobo corn which certainly would have benefited greatly from some salt.at this point seeing the emperor for his lack of clothes while wondering why the duo opts to change their chicken at each venue when the original version is the one that earned them such acclaim, it was in a trio of shakes that the meal concluded and although none were particularly innovative each was clearly crafted of good ice cream, the vanilla trending a bit thin and mellow while the nutella and caramel were decidedly sweet and thick enough to stick a spoon up straight.overpriced and overseasoned with little more than a name to justify the hype blue ribbon fried chicken joins the likes of most of downtown summerlins imported eateries, a situation that makes one wonder just how long the public will continue to bite.
very surprised that we didnt like this place. nice location, clean, very good service.  it positions itself as better than fast food chicken like a canes but more casual than dinner out at a sit down restaurant.for us, it was pricier than expected and lacking seasoning. ketchup was my favorite sauce on the table. the wildflower honey had an overpowering taste and none of the other honeys were any better. the barbeque sauce was better than honey but had a strong smoke taste and not very balanced.  the ranch was pure buttermilk and missing all seasoning.the chicken tenders which we split has nice seasoning on the outside but needed a good sauce or more spice to stand out. fries were great, thin and crispy. cole slaw was pleasant but very mild flavored.everything is listed as fresh made and nothing was greasy but overall lacking in flavor especially with price being higher than typical fried chicken joints.
when we walked in it looked empty. the decor is nice. i think they over spent on alert ready numbers. the 4 flat screens are nice to watch sport events. the appearance of food looked great. the wings flavor of skin was good but once you got pass that nothing. i think popeyes chicken has a better flavor. wings felt under cooked and a lot of fat on them. fries are ok, once they cool off the cheese hardens, sour cream cannot help the fries. the bacon being fried fresh were good. the customer service was great. they always checked on you. i do think chick filet is a lot better. i dont think i will come back. actually my husband his fried chicken is 200 better.
we lunched today at blue ribbon. we received our order 20 minutes after the time on our cash register receipt, too slow for most lunch hours.  the staff was friendly and helpful. unfortunately the chicken was not good. the wings were doused in a salt cayenne powder that made them barely edible, and i usually add salt to 90 of my food.  there is obviously no quality control at this restaurant. also they only have tenders, thighs, and wing segments. to me everything tastes heavily processed and unnatural.
as stated in the other reviews, brfc has great service and is a casual comfortable dining area. the food is decent, but not worth the trip from silverado ranch. the fried chicken was decent at best. chicken was bland, sauces were too sweet...or right in to hot. breading was either too thick or fatty, if that make sense. the tenders were really good as were the fries with gravy!biggest set back was the pricing. although its a fast food style, be ready to spend fullservice prices.
they dont even have actual fried chicken. they have boneless chicken patties that are fried and drumettes and mini wings. went there looking for actual fried chicken since its in the name of the establishment,  walked out. this place will be out of business in 2 years
expect to pay way too much for this chicken. base flavor is vinegar. family of 3 cost was 50. ordered the original, the natural,  2 tender meals. turned each into a combo which added shoe string fries and coleslaw.coleslaw was very tangy and not our kind of flavor.pickled cucumbers on the sandwiches were really strong. ranch was bland and watery. vanilla shake just okwheat beer decentif you like that strong vinegar flavor this is your joint otherwise well probably pass on this one. they only have one other restaurant in ny
i want to say first off,  the staff at blue ribbon was very nice. however, the prices are way out of touch with summerlin reality. i mentioned it to the register clerk.  he told me theyre trying to keep the prices at the same price they have them back east. the bill for my two young kids in me came to almost 50. i gave him 100 bill. he told me they do not take hundred dollar bills. this is also ridiculous. if you charge that much you better expect to take larger bills. also, i learned at an early age, never refuse money. if you have a problem with forgeries, have systems in place to prevent it. such as monetary scan mechanisms or those pens that you use to verify that the bill is real.   we sat down. the seats are white. so they showed the dirt off beautifully.  the food came. delivered by a very nice server.  the food really was mediocre. all the food seemed to have a flavor of paprika on it. i have not had kfc in years but i remember kfc being much better than what we had for lunch, and considerably less expensive.  ok, my suggestion to blue ribbon, is to reduce your price by at least 25 and except larger bills. a clean seat is also not a bad idea.
not a big fan of this place. ive tried it twice so far and i just dont like it. if you like heavily battered chicken fried really hard that lacks flavor, then this may be the place for you. nice modern set up and good service both visits but a tad bit over priced for fried chicken and fries if you ask me. i wouldnt recommend to anyone i know.
ten minutes for a sandwich? and theres hardly any customers? and its overpriced? and its tastes mediocre? first and last trip.
really cute inside, but wasnt really impressed with food.  bought the chicken tenders.  seasoning was good, but the chicken itself wasnt good, texture was off.  macaroni was super dry.   the mashed potatoes were very tasty.   was way overpriced for food that wasnt amazing.  i see a lot of great reviews and wish that was the same quality i saw, but unfortunately i didnt.
i had left an initial review but since some time has gone by and since there have been changes to the business, i figured i would update my review. i was an avid and loyal customer to the prior business that was there, belfiores. of course, i dont expect things to be similar or stay the same but i didnt expect there to be such a drastic difference. ive given dinos the benefit of the doubt by chalking up their lack of whatever to thr fact that they just opened. since months have gone by, i will not be giving them any more chances. ive given the business about 8 or 9 chances to get their sht together but they have not met the expectations of myself or many others who i brought and who visited separately. im very sad to say this but what pizza place pizzeria doesnt serve pizza?!? i learned that dinos only serves pizza during the lunch hours. i have visited the business a few times around 2pm or so. the counters were bare at that time. i would assume that their pizza hours are from approximately 11 to 11:30am until about 1pm or so. i also learned that they do not make and serve sicilian slices at all except for togo orders. i did order a whole pie during my first visit when they didnt have slices available. unless things have changed, i was not satisfied in the least bit.during my last visit to get slices, which were not available at 2pm, i asked the waitress why they have set hours for pizza and she couldnt answer. she mentioned that theyll be having an official grand opening soon. i asked if the pizza hours will change with the grand opening and she said no. since theu didnt have slices available, i opted to get a couple cannolis. what i do like is that dinos does not fill their cannolis with the cream until you order them. that prevents them from being soggy. i understand that italian pastries are a sort of delicacy and so the prices will not be cheap. they serve two different sizes of cannolis; small and large. i assumed the prices would be about 2.25 for a small and about 3.25 for a large. when i was rang up, the price for two large ones came to just under 8! thats absolutely insane!!! during my past visits and this current one, the pastry case was a little bare. there was a lot of empty space. as time goes by, they seem to fill the case a little more with variety but it still lacks about 50 of the cold case space. of all the times i gave this business the benefit of the doubt, they were always empty. it was never crowded.  in fact, there wasnt anymore than four people in the restaurant, meaning customers. this business has been open for months now and they still have not yet had a grand opening. in my opinion,  by the time they do have their grand opening,  they would have lost most of their business by these negative things. i will not be giving dinos another chance at all until after their grand opening.  maybe by then they would realize that the way theyre conducting business is chasing customers away and change some things for the better. this is a business that thrives on being open on the weekends for families that are out and about on the weekend and others. i cant beleive that they choose to be closed on sundays. i can understand if theyre slammed during the week and do good business. a rival business, romanellis, is closed on sundays as well. the difference is that they have the influx of business during the week to do so. they also have theyre stuff together and arent loosing business. dinos is loosing business on an everyday basis and it baffles me as to how they can risk going under by being closed on sundays. maybe theyll reckgnkze this and change some things.the positive things i notice are the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. the cannoli cream is excellent, although the cream can use a little garnish such as a slice of orange rind or chocolate chips mixed in. the cleaniless of the facility is great. the prior business,  belfiores, was very dirty! the decor inside is nice as well. thats about all the business has going for it. this review is based on factual things and also my personal opinion. everything in this review is 100 correct.  i give credit where credit is due and the same with constructive criticism.
great parts department! parts here are cheaper than most dealerships. personally i would never bring my car to a dealer for service but i will definitely keep coming back for oem parts.update:parts: still great!!! keep it up!service: service so far was good. i have grant foster as a service advisor. they had damaged my car but took care of everything! havent had a problem. he doesnt try to add bs on. thanks grant!sales:came to big two looking for a used 2012 camry. the sales person was very helpful, she was new. i test drove a 2011 camry that was scratched up and falling apart... but still certified. they kept thinking i didnt have the credit for a car until they checked it. their entire attitude changed. they wouldnt give me what i wanted for the trade in. i started talking with one of the sales managers, i believe his name was rusty? all he could  say was the price is the price and wouldnt work with it at all... he said they were losing money on the deal. so i told him no thanks and left. i dont think i could by a car from them. i wasnt treated well at all.
ok, so here is my story about big two toyota.  i just moved down from utah a few months ago and needed to take my 2010 camry in for its 40k mile check up, which is basically an oil change, top off the fluids,  and tire rotation.  i did my research on yelp, as usual, and found that this dealership had received better reviews than another one that was even closer to me, so i took a chance and went to big two toyota.  but then how can you screw up an oil change, right? i expect good quality work from a dealership and they seem to have delivered.  however, the rest of my experience was very lacking.  i had made an appointment, and arrived on time, but it still took them 2 34 hours to complete the work, after having told me it would take about an hour, and at the longest an hour and a half.  who takes almost 3 hours to change oil and rotate tires?!  if they schedule you for an appointment, you kind of expect that they will have the time to do the work.  and not once did anybody come and explain why it was taking so long.  when i finally went to the service counter to find out what the heck was going on, i got no apology or even empathy from the girl at the counter.  she was not rude, per say, she just simply didnt seem to care.  miraculously, and somewhat suspiciously, they just happened to be finishing up the paperwork at the exact moment that i checked on the status of my car.  i think i had been forgotten about, to be honest, and they didnt have the courage to tell me the truth.  but whatever the reason for the delay, i never received an apology from anybody.  i felt that the entire time that they simply didnt care about me as a human being.  from the service person who wrote up my order, to the girls at the check out desk, they simply didnt give a st.  i can tolerate a great deal of mistakes in life, as that is just part of the human condition, but something i refuse to accept as a consumer is indifference from people to whom i have paid to provide a service.  in fairness, they did have a wonderfully nice lady who worked at the counter where they give you a bottle of water and sell you cookies, and my car didnt leak out all of the oil and burn up the engine on my way home, so for that i give them two stars.  but for the 2 hour and 45 minute wait, just to get an oil change and tire rotation after having been told 1 to 1 12 hours and the generally poor and smug attitude of the staff, i take away 3 stars.  i think i will try someplace else next time, and i recommend you do the same.
update...i thought i needed to provide an update, as a few things have transpired since the writing of my review of big two toyota.  first, as you can see, the service manager added a response to my less than stellar experience with their dealership.  i very much appreciated the response, which requested that i call him; however, my work schedule does not provide me with much free time to make phone calls during the day, so i thought i would send him a slightly more detailed accounting of what occurred on the day of my experience there.  sadly, i never heard back from him and no offer to make things right was ever made, and frankly never expected.  i guess a leopard sometimes struggles to change its spots.  on the bright side, i decided to give earnhardt toyota a try on my next service and they were awesome see my separate review for them; they have earned my business, which apparently not what big two toyota of chandler had in mind.
i was there to do oil change and multiple inspection since i  received a coupon. when i was there and handed the coupon to the advisor, he gave me an unhappy look. and i had my car washed after the service, but it was a very lousy job. there were water marks all over in the back. and my tire pressure light was on, they didnt even put air for me. i thought that was a basic thing to do no matter what kind of service you do.
weve been here a few times now and although we were happy to finally have a dq closer to home, this one is a major disappointment. they have yet to get an order correct. during one trip, we ordered a cheeseburger with only ketchup. i know, i know, picky eaters! seems easy enough. opened the burger to find they had put mustard on it and tried to correct it by scraping it off. what?!?!? the manager came out to argue with us that it was made correctly. good times! i will drive the extra few miles to go to a different location.
we moved to this side of town and this is the closest grocery store to us. we started shopping there and i noticed things were a bit pricey. i thought they couldnt be that much more expensive so i went to smiths this last big grocery trip to compare. i was shocked at how much cheaper smiths was! not like cents cheaper but dollars! its crazy. i will go to haagen for quick just need a few things but my big grocery shopping will be at smiths. haagen does have a huge ice cream selection but the prices are outrageous. the cookies from haagen are very good. they never seem to have good sales either. the checkers have always been nice except for the one lady who wouldnt let me pay for the firefighter behind me. she was weird. i love that they have the little shopping carts for the kids but the high prices will keep me away.
haggen is on boulder hwy in henderson nv and prices their products like whole foods in beverly hills.  i dont know who wants to pay 50 to 100 more per item and i am sure there arent enough to keep this store in business.  look for the closing before the end of the year.  too bad because we need a high end grocery store in this part of town.  somehow, haggen thought high end meant trick the customers into thinking that hunts tomato paste at haggen is worth double the price of hunts tomato paste at vons or smiths.
the only thing this store has going for it is the employees. they are very helpful and friendly and not the fake friendly, they are genuinely nice. but we have to shop at 2 haggen stores to find the items we regularly buy. at this particular location we like to buy the fresh baked sunflower honey loaf at the bakery so delicious, the store on lake mead in henderson has the layered bean dip we like, they each never have both. ive asked at this store about the bean dip and the deli girl walked over to see if it was there, it was not,  she went to the back to ask about it and came out looking embarrassed and told me that they hadnt made any today and basically said it was a hit or miss if they got around to it. they never get around to it because its never there.ive also shopped at the store in boulder city and it has neither the bread or the dip among other things. the shelves there are also bare, the deli items are dried out and look inedible, im guessing not enough shoppers.sad.   my point is where the heck is the consistency?  i love the concept of this store but cant be going to several different locations to buy the stuff we enjoy.
the only reason i even give them 2 stars is because i like the employees and i have been shopping this location for 13 years. haggens has been a big disappointment, they slowly have been carrying less and less. heard from a good source that they havent been able to pay to for all of their shipments. they wont be able to stay open if they cant pay for their inventory. i know they arent overpaying for manpower, they cut their people way back. just waiting for a major chain to buy them them out, they got in way too deep.
well, i received a 25 haggen gift card for the cooked and feathered hot wings that i reported to their corporate office a week ago, so i thought i would try another location since i was not far. happy to say that they changed chicken suppliers. no chicken with feathers found. however, i did find molded, allegedly fresh, strawberries and fat free organic expired milk multiple cartons. today is 9915  the cartons were 2 outdated days! my observed shortcomings were reported to a manager who said nothing more than, i will tell my floor magers. hellocorporateagain! its you friendly  faithful shopper!
the first thing i noticed when i walked in was that there were no ingredient lists on some of the prepackaged deli items.  i asked the deli worker if she had something that said what the ingredients were and she couldnt help me.  she just said that they didnt come with any.  i thought it was illegal to sale food items without the ingredients listed.  i didnt buy anything from the deli. i went into to store to buy poppy seed filling but  they didnt have any.  i ended up going to smith because i knew they would have it. i never went back because i dont see the point of having to go to two stores.  its a waist of time.  this store needs to get their act together.
the skinny: skip the cuban and the chicken pot pie 2service: slow and inefficient for a 24 casino diner 2 value: skip this joint... there are better places in the city 2.the hubs was craving some chicken pot pie so we decided to hit siegels for a good tuck in. we headed over to the el cortez and braved the smokey hallway to get to the restaurant. the question is... was it worth it?overall,  i am grateful the hubs decided he needed a pick me up and got us a venti green tea frappucino before getting there. because if he hadnt,  we would have been way less patient with the service. once we were seated,  the server took a while to come to our table. the buser got us some water but our server was largely mia. this is even after we purposely closed our menus to signal that we were ready to order. we didnt know who our server was until a good 15 minutes when she finally showed up at the table. our food also took a while yes,  i know we ordered chicken pot pie which takes longer.... but it took 30 minutes. the only thing our server was good at was leaving a check. picking it up was another matter and i had nearly finished my review before she came and picked it up. on to the food. i ordered the cuban which was pretty horrible. the roasted pork was dry and extremely salty. the lack of mustard mayo also added to the dryness and lack of flavor. they also did not have properly sliced pickles in there  just lay a large pickle spear inside. plus,  the cheese was not completely oozing out of the sandwich like a real cuban. boo! the side of coleslaw was pretty meager and served in a small ramekin for butter. that may have been a good thing as the coleslaw was tasteless. the hubs chicken pot pie was bad too. the chicken was cooked to the point of mushy baby food and certainly not in chunks. the stringy bits of chicken could only be matched by the undercooked vegetables.  the puff pastry was doughygummy yet slightly burnt on top. flavor wise and texture, a marie callenders frozen chicken pot pie is far superior to what we experienced here. served with a side of rubbery unseasoned broccoli,  we had enough. between the subpar service and the food,  there is no reason to schlep it to downtown and brave the smell of el cortez for this. 2 starred review.
so this used to be flame, which i heard was an awesome steakhouse.  i usually stay at el cortez because, its easy to get to, navigate around, friendly staff and had a great steakhouse and 24 hour cafe.  now the cafe is gone and the steakhouse is now siegels open 24 hours.  i went there for breakfast and had the crescent sandwich.  it was not very good, dry and really lacking in any type of flavor, reminded me of cardboard.  the potatoes were also on the cold side and and also lacked in any type of flavor.  i miss my 5 burger, fries and a beer at the old cafe.  might give them another shot or might have to look elsewhere to stay as i prefer to eat where i am staying.
dinner time for this senior couple. plenty of seating in a wide open space. read the menu pricey but a new establishment. go to order nice gentleman in a tie trys to take our order. i was having a club sandwich, my husband wanted a burger. thats when the trouble started. no substitutions. we prefer to have salad with our meals instead of fries. these places do not want to accommodate diet needs. fries , salad near the same food cost. there are plenty of places to eat in vegas but this will not be one. used to love el cortez steak house. to bad.
we ate at spiegels three times while in vegas this trip since we stayed at the cortez.  i found it to be needlessly expensive and slow.  the first meal around 10 pm the staff was slightly slow but good, but the food meatloaf dinner mediocre.  the second meal 56 pm the waitress ignored us while the other table people the waitress knew were treated like royalty.  the food of that meal was good but extremely expensive for what was given to us.  24 for a strip steak with three pieces of shrimp.  thats it.  just meat and shrimp.  no salad, no sides, nothing came with the meat!  who does that??the third meal around noon the waiter was very good, and the waffle was good, but for 9 i think they could have given me two.  i mean really a waffle is not that expensive to make!i think id rather eat somewhere else...
ive played at the el cortez for many years and i dont think i can say ive ever eaten there until this last trip during the life is beautiful show. id have to say, for the location, and the mere fact that this is one of the dumpiest hotels in the entire area, they are really nuts to want to charge the prices they do. and to top it off, they have high end items, next to slop. people in suits next to crazy homeless couples who stink. i cant put it any nicer, no shoelaces, no socks, a suit looking outfit that hasnt been washed for many months, and this place has bus girls that walk around like turtles. wow. they really need to bring in a camera so people can see this place, its beyond belief. i wonder if anybody actually comes in after the social security and general relief and welfare runs out. this casino was really nice. its bad. really really bad. thats all ill say on it. you get the picture.
we stay at the cortez about a week a month, we used to love the cafe, now all they have is this restaurant. the food is ok not worth the price but worst of all is the service! they ignore you and only pay attention to you once you bug them, just terrible. i honestly would prefer eating at there subway!
the only reason i go here is they give me a 21 every month and then a free food coupon every once in a while.  to make up for all the free food they charge ways to much for what they serve.  you think when you get a coupon for 20 that your going to get a great meal for two, but that is just a sandwich.  i won a 50 voucher from one of there contests, i was able to get 2 drinks, a daily special and an upgraded burger and 2 deserts.  the food is the chefs take on things and every time i get something new there is a what is this moment.  like we got a house salad, but it was a lot of greens and not iceberg, so it didnt get eaten.  it seems every time ive been here 5 times that someone gets something that doesnt get eaten or sent back because it is so different then what was expected.  even with a 21 is seems to be a questionable value.
where do i start.....the meal: my mom asked me to take her for the prime rib special she has enjoyed over the years. the coffee shop is closed but we were told siegels 1941 offers the prime rib deal. 10.95 just like before, however you need to ask for it.meat:the meat was perfectly rare, and was seasoned nicely they scored 10 points,  her piece was extremely fatty and she left a pile of fat on the plate.mine was perfect, there was enough marbling to add flavor, it was not as tender as i have had before but still good.the potato: the baked potato was rinsed and baked, there was no seasoning, not even salt, nor did they rub oil on it, so it was presented plain, and it was not even split. my first thought, was that it was not cooked! there was a generous amount of butter and sour cream to add taste, presentation is everything... the vegetables: the green beans, carrots, and waxed beans were no better than the potato. there was no flavor, no salt, come on, at least throw garlic powder on them. my mom asked me to taste the carrot, it was textured mush, so two bowls were returned on our plates minus one carrot each.the salad: i give points for the salad, it was a spring mix and the dressing was good. what ruined the salad, the bag of saltine crackers. if the bag was opened and crackers were placed on the plate the salad would look more appetizing. the looks of the plates were cafeteriathe decor: when you first enter, you feel as though you stepped into vintage vegas, as we sat down and as we looked around we could only shake our heads. i loved the photographs on the wall of bugsy, the black and whites are great, the chandeliers and lighting, sinatra and others are singing in the background and this is a nice touch.then in the corner there is a flat screen tv with sports on, i am then looking to see where the bar is and there is none, it is so out of place.  the red booths against the wall are nice as well as the chairs that are retro, then i look at our side of the dining room and we are all sitting on wicker chairs that belong on a veranda. order more of the elegant chairs, or if you cant get them, sell all of them and make them uniform, or cover them all in red fabric covers!. the room does have glass windows and you can see into the casino and that is nice, however i began to cough because the smoke enters in through the front of the restaurant, for that reason alone i cannot go back, i have asthma. the beautiful drapes at our table with the wicker placemats, ruins the ambiance. it is like siegels cant decide if it is a nice dinner spot or a coffee shop. if they change the name to siegels coffee shop some of this could be forgiven. the servers have great uniforms so maybe i expected more, it just needs to decided what it wants to be, casual or elegant. if management polished what they have, siegels 1941 could be a gem!the service: poor. we were seated and a server came by and asked what we would like to drink, then a second one came over and was asking about drinks and food, they had my mom and i both speaking till i stopped and asked, who is the server because i am not sure who to talk to since one was on the side and the other at the front. we both declined water and a few minutes later the water arrived. we both thanked the serverbusser. then came the wine. i do not expect 5 star service but when one pours from a carafe, if you lift it away from the glass it looks nicer. a busser had a quick conversation with another employee that was leaving for home at our table, so we looked at her back as they spoke. having a better command of english without an accent would help, i had a difficult time but my mom really struggled. part two, the busser came by to fill the 2 inches of water my mom did drink and my mom said, no thank you but she continued to pour the water. i am not sure if this was a language issue, or a busser on auto pilot. the server came by to ask if we needed anything, as we said no thank you, she left before thank you came out of our mouths, pausing a moment would be a good thing. i thought for sure she would return with the bill without asking for dessert, this is a peeve of mine, if there is a check in hand i always ask to see the dessert menu, much to my delight, she asked if we would like dessert! she scored points. training could make the dining experience very nice.i do not like to write a negative review, i feel guilty, the el cortez has been a favorite place to take friends from out of town to have the chance to experience old school vegas, and the charm was lost here. i will watch other reviews and see what happens, but if it does not change, i will not be returning.
saw this on new times and thought, sweet  now we are going to have a local foodie place for doughnuts.  so i drove over this morning and ponied up 17.95 for a dozen and proudly walked them into my office to tell everyone about why this place stands out.  we all grabbed a doughnut and bit into at the same time, and everyone had the same look on their face, of, disappointment.......we bought the following flavors:prickly pearpeanut butter chocolate genachestrawberry cheesecakesalted caramelglazedmaple baconsounds interesting right?first off, the problem that affected all the flavors, and maybe this is a foodie thing, but the dough was like dense pretzel dough.  biting into one of them has the sensation of a very dense soft pretzel or biscuit.  it maybe felt like they were using rising dough, but didnt activate the yeast or let it rise first?  then, the flavor issues.  prickly pear is a filled doughnut like a traditional jelly doughnut  but the jelly part was only filling an area about the size of a nickel, and only right at the edge.  see pic attached  there is a big uncooked dough section in the middle  i ate the first one thinking that was supposed to be in there, then i sliced one in half to take the pic and yikes, i ate a half cooked doughnut.  peanut butter chocolate  pretty good, could taste both the peanut butter and chocolate.  this was the most flavorful of them all.strawberry cheesecake  also a jelly style doughnut, but just sweet with what looks like white chocolate.  i guess we were expecting the kind of cheese you might get in a danish, but no.salted caramel  sounds like a treat, but couldnt taste any salt until the last bite  very lightly flavored.glazed  just a sweet biscuit or sweet pretzel  whatever they glaze it with just soaked into the doughnut.maple bacon  little bacon bits on top  but only adds an ever slight flavor element.all in all, we were totally let down.  maybe its opening day jitters but the recipe for the doughnut part seemed totally unthought out and prepared incorrect.  this place makes dunkin donuts seem gourmet, which is exactly the opposite of what i had hoped to find.
i just love the concept and the location.  but the execution is a little off.  really need to work on the donut dough.  much too heavy and dense.  we will be back if we see some  reviews that the dough has changed.
tons of potential, but its not there yet. went to this new spot to try the donuts. cute little spot, very nice employees offer a warm greeting. we bought four donuts to take back to work. strangely they dont offer regular coffee, just fancier stuff which is nice but dont forget the basics. back at the office i tried the glazed donut. honestly i think they opened too soon, prior to proper research and development. the donut was very chewy, almost like you took a tube of rolls and baked them, and iced them. i could only take two bites before having to toss it which is a first since im a donut enthusiast. i have to wonder if they are doing random quality control checks and actually tasting their products? i cant imagine they do because im not sure how you could put out that product to sell. also the price point just does not compute.  happy to pay a premium for premium goods, but at this point these donuts arent even at the level of frys grocery stores which dont have much to brag about either. if i could make suggestions to the owners:1. rework either your dough or cooking process. something is off and must be addressed numerous reviews noting the same issue2. offer regular brewed coffee. go old school, make a big ass container and charge a buck a cup youll still make good money on that. 3. change your price point. expensive doesnt  good. good  good. make a great product, charge a reasonable price and make tons of money. just ask the owners of bosa. they are millionaires by selling great donuts. hopefully they can work out the kinks if not i fear it will be hard to survive. this place has tons of potential but needs some serious work. donuts need to not only look good, but taste good as well.
staff was fantastic. very nice, enthusiastic, and a pleasure to talk to. the store is also awesome, very nice looking, and clean. some of the other reviews say the dough needs rework, and im inclined to agree. after we bought the donuts which looked amazing, we took em home to eat  boy were we disappointed. the chocolate had a funny taste, and the dough was very chewy, almost gummy. this place has so much potential, and ill keep supporting them until they get there. 2 stars for awesome service and great atmosphere, but lacking im the actual donut department.
like a teenager whos parents tell her not to date that young man with the tattoos and leather jacket, sometimes i just have to find out for myself. i read the reviews for this place. over priced, they said. too dense, they said. come on its a donut! how bad can it be?turns out they were all correct. i got there at like 10:30am which i understand is like 2am in the donut world. they were out of the ones i had my eye on but i settled on the samoa. oh after i asked for a recommendation and didnt really get one. just kind of a mumbled response. then this conversation happened.me: so the samoa and a cup of coffee.guy: okay the samoa any coffee or iced tea with that?me: yep, a cup of hot coffee.guy: okay...messes with the register so you wanted a cup of coffee?then there was no cream out fine. i get it... health code. but there were also no stirs by the utensilssugar. i swirled my coffee with a plastic knife and went on my way.now, im not above paying for overpriced baked goods especially when theyre local. but the service and the donut were just underwhelming. 2 stars for the graphic design  creativity of flavors. ill stick with bosa.
not good. not special. not worth the trip. i really wanted to be infatuated with this place, but it just didnt come through. the donuts are no better than krispy kreme and definitely dont hold a candle to bosa. they felt stale, the dough was strange, and the muffin was burned. save yourself the trouble.
one bad chewy donut and one better tasting less chewy donut. most donuts at this modest shop are glazed over and some are,raised higher than others. my coffee cake crumble variety was on the poor end as the dough issues are not fixed and likely never will be fixed. it just seems to be the way these people make donuts. it should not win them a loyal following although the samoa had some real potential. first if all..it had toppings on both sides of the donut which is highly unusual. .but even though this donut was better tasting..it still had that odd chewy texture as reported. the price was about 2 bucks each, which is average, but something is off here in this donut shop location which already has claimed two other victims and should claim another eventually.
i love helping small businesses succeed but they gotta work with me. i tried three different donuts and threw them all out. even my sugar loving wife didnt like them. i couldnt tell if they were day old or if its just a really bad dough recipe.
never before had i eaten a donut that was tough and rubbery. now ive had 1.5 i gave up on the 2nd. it was like chewing toastflavored gum.
this company has entered into the las vegas food market and i personally think they have badly judged the market.  they seem to want to be thought of as a cross between a convenience market and a whole foods.  they are neither.their pricing is high, much higher than albertsons and smiths.  the produce we have had so far is not up to whole foods quality but they seem to charge on par with them.  i went looking for advertised shrimp on sale.  they didnt have what was advertised but had something called brown shrimp of the same size for even less.  i bought it as recommended by the guy at the counter saying it was even better shrimp, time will tell.  no sign of the product they advertised.i am searching for a reason to shop here.  well something other than that the store was empty at 1:30pm on a thursday.i find the employees friendly but i even saw places where you couldnt figure out the price of an item so i didnt even consider buying it.i know they are new but they say they have been in business for over 80 years, they should have a better handle on all of this.if they dont lower their prices, we will not be shopping there much.
since the new folks have taken over its really gone downhill. the store is dirty, and they dont have enough staff. while buying flowers yesterday there wasnt anyone at the flower check out, but there were two employees nearby complaining about their personal lives.
seriously? i went inside for a few things with an open mind..but when they ask 15 for a small container of tide laundry soap, i cant take them seriously. their prices suck. they really are a mixture of whole foodsprices and fresh and easyconvenience.save your time and go to smiths.
well, its been a few months and im afraid i have to update my review.  i came in the store the other day and many of the shelves were barren.  i took a photo of the meat department which i will upload and there were few meats available.  i asked a manager if they were shutting down the store and trying to get rid of inventory and he told me they were in chapter 11 reorganization and would have the shelves stocked by vendors the following day and were promised better support going forward.  now, i hope that is true and they make it because they have good products and its convenient for a quick stop on my way home from work.  i think i may be willing to fight a small bear for their bakerys brownie cookies as well.  in addition, i also think their produce is nice compared to vons.  as far as pricing, you just have to look for deals. they have come down it appears and i still say albertsons has higher pricing.  even though this location is not my main shopping spot nor was vons previously as something happened where they went downhill a year before haggens came along, i am rooting for them to get their groove on and succeed
this store has an ok floral departmen but heres a hack to get the best arrangements; they keep the fresh flowers in the back store room. youre welcome!
this is the the place to be if youre into paying 10 to eat a huge loaf of bread lightly speckled with catfish meat. very lightly maybe 23oz.portions  pricing is grossly out of whack. wont return until i hear this has been corrected.
tons of good reviews but i couldnt find all these amazing flavors?! got the shrimp and sausage po boys as well as the gumbo. the gumbo was like water... it made me immediately regret my decision to not go to lolas instead. the po boys were so drenched in sauce and salt my meats were crying for help! poor guys were drowning. i get that everyone has different tastes, but this place wasnt for me.
i was very disappointed!  i arrived for my 7:15 reservation on time, and grabbed a table outside. the waiter did not come over until 7:45!  we sat for 30 minutes watching him wait on everyone else, ignoring us; i thought we were invisible. he kept looking at us, but never said a word. finally, he came over...so what will you have to drink was his greeting. not, welcome to corkbuzz, not sorry for the long wait, nothing.  we ordered wine and 2 appetizers.  took awhile for the wine to be served and it was a very skimpy pour.  after a long wait, one appetizer finally came out.  it wasnt until almost 20 minutes later that our second appetizer was delivered, and the server tried to give it to another table!  i literally grabbed her arm to get my food! the food was good, but we couldnt get past the poor service and lousy attitudes. we asked for our check and went elsewhere for the rest of our dinner.  i expected more from this establishment. i realize this place is new and has some kinks to work out, but a simple sorry for the wait and a friendlier attitude would have gone a long way. i wish you guys all the best, hope your service improves.
this place is still working out the kinks. made a reservation and was seated right away. cool hip and loud crowd...stage was set for a fun evening. started with wine and apps. a few minutes later, the charcuterie and two nice glasses showed up, but our other selection was curiously missing. i really like the wine list here and i was impressed with the place. unfortunately, from there, it dropped off a cliff. we placed entree orders and then waited...and waited. after 45 min, we got an apology and some bread, along with a promise that our order was coming right up. then we saw our order go right by us to another table.  soon after our surprised server went to the back and came back with another apology and more charcuterie. it was another 30 minutes before we got our food, but by then our babysitting time was up. we barely ate, lightened our wallets by 100 and left with another apology and a certificate for a free glass of wine. the entire meal should have been comped. i think this place could be decent with better management no excuse since they have multiple locations, but we were highly disappointed.
our server made it apparent that had other things to do than wait tables.  she made it a point to say that she should be in the back office rather than waiting tablesapparently someone was at the golf course that she has to fill in for.     drinks sunday mimosas are outrageously priced for charlotte.   13 a glass is overpriced for this city.   the only other offer was halfprice bottles of champagne that are overpriced to begin with.    service was slow despite a dining room that was maybe 12 full at most.  check this place out for the food only give the chef some credit it was awesome .  leave any and all expectations for service or a bang for the buck at the door.  very much a letdown for a new and upandcoming area.
overpriced,overpriced,overpriced. not sure who is rating this higher than 23 stars unless they just have too much money. 6 of us had dinner and were disappointed for the exorbitant cost. scallops were good but 3 scallops with no other offering for 26 dollars???? tater tots were mediocre and would have been better off getting hash browns at at chick a fila. salmon tartar was inedible and pumpkin custard taste like a sponge and we had them take it off menu. burgers were ok but 14??go somewhere else for cost!!!!!!
i ordered for delivery on 75. it showed up and was a disaster. several containers were badly leaking all over the place. it was a total mess. they had to have known because there was a huge puddle collected on the bottom of two bags. the moo shu pork came with 2 yes 2 pancakes for a pint of filling. wtf? taste was so so at best. rice sucked. not a huge fan of any chinese restaurants in the area now i can add chef panda to that list. as i said in an earlier post, if you want great east coast chinese food, go to kowloon in saugus, ma. if you want great west coast chinese food go to hon lin in san bruno, ca. nothing else measures up. i know there are great chinese places in ny, ca, and of course the famous ruby foos in montreal. i guess great chinese food is harder to find outside of nyc, the bay area and possibly hawaii. oh well it is what it is.
tried for the first time today. i had he kung pao chicken it was not that good. the sauce was good but chicken was rubbery
since it is new and we are always looking for good chinese food, we tried chef panda.  sorry we did!  it is obviously set up for take out, as they only 4 combination meals to eat in, if you wish to.  we ordered their house chicken; it was served in a styrofoam take out container.  admittedly it was full of fried rice and chicken maybe enough to serve two, but both were essentially tasteless!  the kitchen looked like organized chaos!  we will not be returning!
ychhh. ordered beef and broccoli, egg rolls, wonton soup, moo shu pork and spare ribs to take out. how can i say this? everything was weird. the broccoli was so overcooked, it was inedible. the beef was slimy and tasteless. the egg rolls are minuscule. ive rolled blunts bigger than these.  the wontons were just small slabs of under cooked dough with no meat inside. who puts cucumbers in wonton soup? the spare ribs were big and meaty but what was that wet brown sauce they were swimming in? the moo shu was ok, thats why i added an extra star, but the hoisin sauce was watered down. the fake duck sauce was awful.im tough on chinese restaurants. i compare them to the better chinatown places in vegas, ny, philly and san fransisco. none in the west valley that i know of, ever come close. but this one is a distant last place.
i try not to eat here to often but i did today. i ordered the grilled teriyaki chicken bowl with mixed veggies. chicken was fine but the broccoli definitely needed more cooking. i usually eat my raw broccoli with ranch. i also found this strange whitish substance on the underside of a piece of broccoli and a glop on a green bean. i noticed the broccoli had a strange taste. stopped eating the veggies at that point. dont know if i will go back.
this place advertises itself as a noodle house. because it was 108 degrees outside, i didnt feel like eating hot noodles andor soup. i ordered the bbq combination. for an in a casino food court the presentation is nice. the quality and quantity of food provided was disappointing. it was dry and tough. as compared to chinatown and factoring the bland unimpressive taste and meager portions, the price would not appeal to the value conscious crowd. but compared to the other eating establishments in this casino food court, the price is on par, about 10 to 12 dollars per plate. remember this review is based on the bbq offerings not the noodles. i assume they should be better. i do have a concern over the layout. there are to many tables that are too tightly packed. one has to turn sideways as you zigzag between them. they are very high tables with stools with exposed sharp corners.  only one table is at a height that can be accessed by wheelchair persons. unfortunately, its located in the busiest and least accessible part of the restaurant. the path is obstructed by a gauntlet of tables, stools and people standing in line to place their orders. i saw a girl with her mother and brother park the wheelchair under the table because that table was inaccessible. luckily, she was both strong and light enough that her two companions were able to assist her into a high stool. strangely, eating utensils are the customers responsibility of getting from a hidden corner in the front. i would say it was the most frequently asked question i overheard. there is a bottomless fountain service for drinks, yeah. but with the slick flooring and lack of any antislip matting. it is literally an accident waiting to happen. in the half hour ive been here i saw one of the employees or owners, linda, almost do a face plant. im looking  forward to trying the noodles in this place  the next time im trapped at silverton. but nothing ive seen induces me to give up my usual noodle spots, mr. noodle or thai style noodle house.
slow service and the food taste like it came from their buffet. better off going to panda express, lol
this is a food court establishment inside a casino, and the food is merely above panda express level. i was very disappointed at the menu. the roasted duck was over roasted.
i read in the local paper that wu hu is a new noodle shop at the silverton. so me and my wife finally got an opportunity to go check it out. we both had the soup of the day, which was wonton soup; it looked beautiful when it came out the kitchen.the entrees we had were general tso chicken with white rice  chow mein noodles with bbq pork. as all the food looked amazing, it was a complete different case when eating it; the food was completely plain and it didnt have any the flavor.in my own personal opinion,  i feel like the restaurant can use a few changes. when i first arrived, i thought this was a sit down restaurant, but it was  not. you go to the counter to order then find a table to sit yourself. you also get your own utensils and fill up your own drink, etc. for the price and atmosphere this place gives off, i feel like a hostess and maybe some waiters can definitely make feel this place as a sit down restaurant. honestly, to have spent this much money for basically a drive thru place is a bit much for nothing. also, the appetizersoup came out after our meals, which is a bit ridiculous if you ask me. the food came out way too fast; i mean the food was out by the time we sat down. i understand some people do not like to wait for their food, but i dont want to feel like im being rushed out. i feel like this can be a great place to eat. it has a great location, their atmosphere looks great,  but i hope the next time i try it, the food will be better.
wow...just bad and overpriced...they saved themselves a 1 because asian is my comfort food and i havent vomited yet .  pho was bland...duck was old and reheated...kung pao was bland...the rice was old and soggy as was the noodles in the pho.  the duck bao was amazingly good and i feel very tricked.  ok...i live walking distance and would not let a limo drop me off for a comped meal.   just plain ew...
they either need to buy more silverware or hire a dishwasher. chopsticks dont work if youre eating soup. the food is adequate.
you guys seriously moved to this place from the old one that was less than 5 minutes away from my house?  seriously?  what happened, did you replace the good pizza pie makers as well?  its on the same street!  the pizza should stay the same!  horrible.  horrible!on a friday night, at least once a month the family  i stay home and order a pizza and watch movies.  save some money, watch some flicks you know?  but being that the pizza hut that was nearest our home now moved to way way up the street near the 215 freeway, i now have to drive nearly 20 minutes each way to get my fix.  i wouldnt mind it if pizza hut kept the same consistency to their pies!  youre a chain, they should stay the same!so i ordered online, and i will admit that im a p.i.t.a when i order because when pizza hut runs their special of a medium pizza for 6.99 each with unlimited toppings i go nuts.  there are three of us in the house, and each of us has different tastes.  so what do i do?  improvise with toppings on each 12 of the pizza!  you figure if its offered online then it really shouldnt be a big deal.  so for each 12 we all get what we want.  ive done this multiple times and our old pizza hut didnt skip a beat.  nor was my pizza ever made that bad.with the order online in, we all take that long drive up the hill of cheyenne ave. to find this new fandangled pizza hut.  turns out its in the same shopping center as the neighborhood walmart.  we get there and park, and whaddaya you know its busy!  friday night!  just got paid!  and here we all are, probably near broke, eating pizza hut.  im ok with this, as long as the pizza is tasty!unfortunately our first round of pizzas was not.  there were some missing toppings from one of our pizzas, and the other one had the incorrect crust!  not to mention, the crusts were looking way flat, like they didnt have enough time to proof.  i was not taking those home, so the manager came by and told me he could make me two new pies but it would take at least 20 minutes since they are backed up.  i agreed and waited.  and waited.  finally after nearly 30 minutes i stood up and asked the gal behind the counter if my reorder was done yet.  it had been sitting in the warmer!  couldnt someone have called me back up right when they were done?  geez.took a look at this round of pizzas and the crusts still looked flat.  i did not order thin crust folks!  then on one of my pizzas they forgot the crust seasonings as well as my balsamic sauce drizzle.  they managed to fix this but rather sloppily.  then on my other pizza, the crust did not look like a pretzel at all!  it should be darker brown along the crust with the sea salt sprinkled on top!  this was some weak  pretzel crust im telling you.  but i didnt want to wait again for another set of pies so we left to trek back home.at least this time with the pizzas the toppings werent as scarce, they shouldnt have been because i ordered like 5 toppings for each 12!  but man these guys need a lesson in placing spinach on a pizza.  can you guys please, please make it look a bit more presentable?  looks like it was thrown on there from a bryce harper lob at midfield.  too much power!  not enough finesse.pizzas were ok, not what we usually enjoy with our movie night at home.  and it all ended with the crust.  toppings were good, fairly fresh, and the cheese wasnt lacking.  it was the horrendous crust holding it all together.  it was too thin, and in some parts underbaked!  ugh!  it had less crisp crunch and too much chew.  you could say it was because of the toppings, but ive ordered lots of toppings on our pizzas from our old pizza hut before and they never came back with uncooked crusts.  its the dough.  wasnt pulled from the freezer long enough and set to proof so it could rise like its supposed to before baking.  i know because i used to work for a pizza hut express back in college and had to proof crusts daily.  im going to venture and guess they didnt make enough crusts for the day because they werent expecting that big of a crowd.  so some of the crusts they pulled out at the last minute didnt thaw enough yes pizza hut uses frozen dough.  but come on, its a friday night!  stoners  poor people alike will want to be ordering pizza!sorry guys, your new location is killin me.  wont be back there for a while until you settle in.  im gonna go with my other pizza place thats less than 5 minutes away...dominos.get it together folks!
wow, theres a new kid on the block, but not all that is new means good, i almost am in shock at my experience when compared to other reviews and opinions ive read so far.maybe its just sundays. the sunday morning service was laughable at best, laugh because i didnt want to cry. i wasnt certain how they handle call aheads, or reservations, it was also a weekend brunch, so i attempted to call ahead to at least ask what the wait looked like. two calls later and no answer, we were already there and parking, but upon entering the compound that is ocotillo, i found the lady at the maitre d stand, with a phone just below her left elbow. seriously?i inquired as to the wait as i put the name in with her and was told just a few minutes, tables were being cleaned now. i guess being cleaned meant 30 minutes, i must have forgotten my english to english translator, silly me. i was unpleasantly surprised to find 6 or 7 open tables as i was getting seated, and the wait had stacked what appeared to be 4 more parties behind me. at this point my best guess was that there werent enough staff for a weekend morning to handle guests demands. i ordered the roast beef and potatoes hash, which came with a sunnyside egg, and after requesting the egg medium, the egg was way undercooked; about 3 minutes under. i tried the roast beef, which was chunks of tough beef, overly chewy and super fatty and the potatoes were large cubes about 1.5inch by 1.5inch, this was not a hash. i had about two bites before deciding to give it back to the server. as i returned the hash, the server replied with a friendly, can i get you something else in stead, which was kind of her, trying to appease my dislike with a different dish, was helpful on her part but i was short on time and wasnt interested in something else at that point.the rest of my party all independently came to the conclusion that their meals werent so amazing as to spend the  theyre charging here, and the wait was over the top. one of the people in the party tried to order the breakfast chimichanga, which they were out of. their second choice; scrambled farm eggs, was quite underwhelming. our party also ordered the bread pudding bowl, which was neither bread pudding, nor was it in a bowl. it was tasty though, and had they called it loaf of gooey cinnamon bread on top of roasted apples with cream, it would have been spot on.being as objective as possible after such a poor experience, the server was friendly and tried to resolve my complaint by allowing me to order a different meal and the bread pudding bowl tasted good, but caveat emptor to the person who orders it expecting bread pudding.i cant say that ill be back soon, but they do have a to go coffee bar, so if you drink coffee maybe you can grab and go from there on your way to work.happy yelping!
beautiful restaurant.i am not convinced by the flavors and combinations.good service and very respectful
second time going to the restaurant.  my first experience was excellent.  today i ordered iced tea and a burger.   iced tea came with no ice.  burger came with rotten tomato slices on the side and generally unappetizing presentation.  asked the waitress for mustard and salt there are no salt and pepper shakers on the table you have to ask.  i waited and waited and waited. the burger was cold.i left the table to search for the manager.   told him i have been waiting for condiments and my burger is cold and the iced tea has no ice.  he never apologized or asked how he could fix it, he just angrily asked whos your server.  he later came out and picked up the plate and gave me a glass of tea with ice.too many choices for restaurants that are consistent in their food and service.  not going back!
this was my first time and i was excited to try this new spot, especially after reading other reviews and seeing pictures. the venue and the food presentation were both really impressive but the food itself was disappointing. i ordered the beef hash and there was so much gristle that i decided to just eat the potatoes and fried egg, and not even try to finish the beef. to drink i ordered the nutella ice coffee boba and to my disappointment, the boba was totally hard and i was handed a soup spoon to eat it as they didnt actually have boba straws suitable for boba.cute place, but id only return if i wasnt paying.
i am very disappointed. our friends said it was good but not tonight. beef ribs were flavorful but came out cold. the ocotillo chicken came out cold as well. the pasta was just ok.
this was our first time here and i really liked the food. our waiter was decent and made suggestions from the menu. however, i did not like some of the other staff. a larger man with white hair and dark glasses dropped a 2nd cauliflower at our table, that we did not order. we tried to get his attention but he just walked off. we moved the dish to another location for it was in the way. in my experience at other restaurants if they accidentally give you an item they let you keep it for the have to throw it away....well this same man came to the table and picked it back up, without saying a word. he then took the dish back to the kitchen and then promptly came back out with the cauliflower dish. he walked by our table and stated its good but not that good to have a 2nd and then went and placed that dish at another table. i dont know for sure but i think it was the same one at our table. just because of this person i will not go back...it also took a long time for water refills.
i was really looking forward to checking this place out since id heard great things from friends. unfortunately, my experience didnt match up with theirs at all. i show up to lunch with my friend at around 2 pm and was happy to see it wasnt super full, we were quickly seated on the patio as requested and began to enjoy the sun and cool breeze. that was great and all, but we then waited for a full twenty minutes for our waitress to introduce herself, and that was only after we went inside to ask if someone would come take our order. initially we wondered why a group of 4 guys abruptly left without ordering, but had i been there on my workday and looking to get lunch during my break, i would have done the same. she finally came and was nice enough, but seemed very disconnected. thankfully, the food saved the day. the falafel burger was one of the best ive had. id give the food 4 stars, but the service was abysmal. hence the 2 stars.
cool spot with a great location, setup and vibe. however my food came out cold not cool, but noticeably cold in the middle and upon being reheated a second time, underwhelmed.  by the time my food came back out, my coworker was done eating. disappointingly, there was no concession or apology for the mistake. i wasnt even thinking it would be comped, but at least maybe a free drink or something may or may not be back.
maybe my experience is an anomaly, but i simply dont get most of these reviews. visiting friends in madison and was really excited to see a new coffee place doing pourovers! i got a v60. no indication on what beans i had or where they came from. the cost was 3.75, about what id pay in my neighborhood in brooklyn. the quality was not good. its no secret among my friends that im annoyingly pretentious about my coffee. 5th elements tasted diluted and watered down. their ratios must be way off, because it simply wasnt good, especially at this price. im sticking to bradburys.
i was very excited to try this new pour over coffee place, as im a big fan of philz, the pour overonly  coffee shops in the bay area.  very disappointing.  the pour over goes into a glass carafe, with much fussing, swirling, and discussing among the staff, who are friendly but a bit  pretentious.  by the time the coffees all done and poured into a mug, its too cold.  and i drink it black.  same thing on a second visit.  depth of flavor not special.other notes:  the batch bakery pastries are very good.  laptop users will wish for more power outlets.  the alreadybrewed coffee does not include a decaf option.
i had a regular coffee. first, filling my travel mug cost me over 3.00! the going for filling a travel mug in coffee shops on more expensive property is 2.00, maybe 2.25.  second, the coffee was on par with random gas station coffee.
i love chipotle, but not this location. very small portioned burrito bowl and i had to spit out a few pieces of chicken because they were predominantly fat. not the best guac either, great coke though. will most likely go back, just disappointed. it could be because this is a newer location. hopefully my next visit will be better.
sloppy service. blasting music.  chewy gristle steak meat... every bite.  but they graciously refunded the meal.
this is a new location.  loooove the convenience of it in my neighborhood, but service sucks and portions are not consistent with other chipotles.  i stood around for a while just waiting for someone to acknowledge me on a saturday at 1:00pm  they were chatting about some bh that just left.  almost all the accoutrements were empty and it didnt look like there was anyone interested in restocking or wiping down the line as they dragged all the orders through food that had fallen and left ignored.  all 6 of my burrito orders were scraping the bottom and not the usual amount of loaded yumminess.  as i was trying to place 2 of the 6 orders together because they had the exact same ingredients, apparently multitasking is not a skill the line girl possesses and did notcould not make 2 burritos at the same time.... im guessing ill be the next b theyll be talking about as soon as i walk out the door.  no thanks  ill go to another location where  its faster, cleaner and the staff is friendlier.
i was unimpressed with tapas 51. the lighting was extremely bright, reminding me of the interrogation rooms on tv. the chili coffee crusted brisket tacos were just okay with little flavor. we had to spit out several fatty and gristly pieces. the grilled shrimp pupusa was delicious with multiple flavors and textures. the chorizo brussel sprouts were good but nothing to write home about. the colombian chorizo sliders were pretty good. i was extremely disappointed with our waitress as she was lacking in personality, never cracked a smile, and never said youre welcome when thanked for bringing out items. we waited entirely too long for her to run our credit card considering the lack of other customers. we never got a visit from the manager or chef even though the chef could be seen outside the kitchen a couple of times. if the customer service were better it would certainly have improved our experience.
this location used to be vons safeway, which i didnt mind in the least.  when i ventured here last week for the first time since the switch over, everywhere seemed the same as vons, which i chalked up to the recent transition.  it seemed as they just slapped green shirts on the employees and called it good.  i review again if they ever morph into something different or more special that vons.
not impressed  lots of hype but theres no way this place fits the area. more expensive and less selection than albertsons. as others have posted  they put a new coat of paint and some shiny stickers on the vons. smiths has better bakery. local fish? from where? meat counter and bakery looked barren. maybe we will get lucky and they turn this place into another glaziers soon? might come back in a few months to see if its still open because even the parking lot is empty.
i miss vons. since the changeover everything is overpriced about 12. some of the meat and fish in the displays at the counter seem a little old. i am glad to see some of the old employees still working here though, but i will drive the extra 2 minutes to the smiths on charleston from now on.
worst rebrand in recent memory, with increased prices and worsened efficiency in every department from frozen food to pharmacy.  not sure if the increased organic section is somehow meant to compete with whole foods, but it seems unlikely a place still pushing fastfood chinese is going to lure the granola crowd across the street while the other changes are likely to send others over to smiths or albertsons for better prices and less hassle.
ive only ever watched one episode of the walking dead, but i imagine the whole series is basically like this store: virtually empty, save for a few deadeyed folks employees walking around aimlessly, and never once greeting me, let alone asking if i need help finding anything. clearly no one in charge here has ever heard of the concept of competitive pricing. everything is easily a buck more than it should be, if not double the price. if youre lucky though, you might find those bright orange 1 manager markdown! stickers except theyre only on the truly ridiculous items, like 8 acai juice and borderlinerotten meat.this place wasnt exactly a hotspot of business when it was vons, but at least the employees were reliably friendly and the pricing was on par with other places in town. haggen has nothing going for it whatsoever. ill take the under on this place making the 6month mark.
so i visited this store today for the first time with my cousin.  it seemed like a very nice store , very clean and well maintained. we were even admiring the colorful and vibrant produce section, despite the higher than usual prices. the butcher case was probably the most impressive part of the store, offering some of the best looking cuts of meat and premarinated choices ive ever seen at a grocery store.they also had a pretty stellar beer selection which is worth mentioning.honestly, it was really creepy in there because the store is huge but we were he only customers shopping, and the store seems completely empty with the exception of an occasional worker.we really liked the store, despite the prices and strangeness, but the only employee we interacted with was kind of rude. when we checked out, my cousin asked if the store was always so quiet, and the lady checking us out very bluntly and annoyed answered him thats because we have no customers, were going out of business.. then it was just silent and awkward for the rest of the transaction. id maybe come back for the meat.. maybe
we were back in town for the ironman in madison, after living here for uw  while cheering and waiting for our runner to make another loop, we looked around for a place to grab a bite..... for 8 of us  found this right around the corner from our spot on state  so went in  it was mostly empty.our server seemed like a weird guy from the 60s  headband and all  finally took drink order  for 8 of us  brought out 2 at a time, so took awhile.then took our meal order, and we waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited  and this was for just your normal burgers.finally he brings the food out  said there is only 1 guy in the kitchen... but place is empty !!we eat, relax, and enjoy our time  but then have to pay and rush out to catch our runner since we waited so long for our dinners......
sorry to say i think this was a downgrade from vons. they have lost some of the variety of products, namely at the deli counter. also, theres a definite price increase from vons. not seeing any improvements to draw me to shop here other than location.
theyve let staff go, and its a ghost town in there at times. i dont think  the corporate powersthatbe understand the local market. word is they are positioning haggens as a competitor of whole foods and are still in the process of remodelingrestocking. in my opinion, we dont need whole foods pricing in this location, however, if they bring quality products at an affordable cost, then were talking. but the way things are going, they may not last long enough to make that a reality.  the place looks nice hence the 2nd star, but prices are ridiculously higher than before, and its not like vons was the cheapest around. haggens needs to do something to show locals they will competitive and responsive to local needs. i miss the friday 5 sales, and during a previous visit, staff werent sure if the starbucks was going to stay. change is inevitable when theres a buyout, but i hope when all is said and done, this place sells quality at more affordable pricing.
as a former resident of western washington,  i feel its necessary to make it clear that this haggen is no haggen. this location and im assuming the others in the valley lacks the pieces that make haggen awesomethe delightfully complicated floor plan, the wide selection of specialty and organic food, wonderful and fresh produce, and a madetoorder deli with sandwiches, sushi, and saladcheeseolive bar that was a regular lunch staple for me! if any east coasters are familiar with wegmans, haggen is like a west coast wegmans. sure, when money was a little tight i would go to haggen just for meat, produce and a meal from the deli and pick up the other pantry staples somewhere cheaper, but the prices i paid for those items were well worth the extra cost. here, though, the produce was overpriced and low quality, the deli was absolutely nothing like how it should be, and we found expired milk and bread. :my husband and i were so excited when we got the mailers, thinking we could return to our favorite grocery store from wa. however, this location is basically probably literally an old vons that they put no effort into making a real haggen; they just slapped some haggen signs throughout. i was disappointed and will continue shopping at sprouts on w. sahara.
like others, i miss the old vons. its more expensive on most items, fewer store brands, and the selection isnt better. this vons was my goto grocery, and im sorry for the old employees, but i am going to start shopping elsewhere. in fact its exactly like the layout of vons with less selection and higher prices.
the prices are ridiculous. 5.69 for my kids cascadian farm granola bars? they are 2 and change at smiths and were 3 and change at vons. mango slices for 9.99?? berries had that white moldy stuff in a day. not impressed at all. the worst is the bakery. what are those soggy dense circles in the rack bagels? seriously? the worst. i like the deli meat but again so expensive. my bill has gone up, i miss the old faces but happy they kept the nice manager, and the workers seem miserable. so do the 3 customers. sad. haggens is a hassle. i miss vons. 2 stars cause i like having a neighborhood grocery store. just not this one.
lame. lame lame lame.so glad they are going away. for a renovated store, it was nasty. looked older than some of the older stores in vegas. quality of products was seriously lacking. no specials, or values on anything i saw. wont come back.
first of all i have to say everyone there was very very nice and helpful especially the waiter. but the crab had no flavor even with the spicy seasoning that i requested. if you really want to know the truth it taste like i bought it from frys  and it was previously frozen nothing like hot and juicy theirs is flavorful fresh!! also i ordered a pound of king crab and got nowhere near it. they swore upanddown that it was a pound but when i go to hot and juicy i have two very large king crab legs and thats a pound so what i had i have no idea how much it was but it was not a pound so needless to say i wont be going back. if i want to pay 26 for crab that i didnt even get ill go to frys lol. oh instead of making it right and giving me my full pound of crab they gave me a piece of cheesecake they could have kept that.
they dont have theyre act together.  service is very slow.  food is not bad  hoping to see some improvements.
the restaurant itself is really nice and clean with a big outdoor patio area. as for the food, the salsa was eh and so were the chips. the burrito supreme with rice and beans was fantastic with a large portion size even at lunch. my son loved the kids beef nachos. what kills this place is the terrible service. there was 1 family guy working for 56 tables and he was very short and never asked how things were the entire time. they first brought out the wrong plate for my son and 10min went by without him even saying a word or even an apology so we had no idea if they were correcting it or when to expect it to even come out. dont be cheap and hire more servers because you obviously have the business to justify it.
seriously just go grab a burrito at the bp next door and heat it yourself. this place is a joke  and im not kidding :
unconvinced.i came in when there was no line and just one person waiting for his pizza ahead of me. ten minutes into my 20minute wait, i was asked if i was waiting for an order. yes.the gentleman who was boxing the orders showed the chefs the pizza before bringing it to me and showing it to me. he clearly knew something was wrong because before i could say anything, he took the pizza back to the kitchen. it was supposed to be a fourtopping pizza that included greens and prosciutto. what i saw was cheese pizza with cherry tomato halves on it. the server went back to the kitchen and proceeded to dump half a pound of cold prosciutto on top of the pizza and then gave it to me to go. i was so exasperated from the wait and didnt have any more time, so i took it and left. in the end, the pizza was not cooked evenly and was lukewarm after having been handled quite a bit after coming out of the oven. it was not tasty.while all the staff were courteous and polite, the service left much to be desired, not to mention the pizza, which was 15 wasted.
overpriced.  undercooked.  looked like cooks threw handful of uncooked arugula on top of soggy, sauceless crust.
we have been here a few times and the food is amazing.  really the only reason i did not give a 1 star review.  the price is slightly high for what you get, but the pizza is really worth it.  however, i tried to go in earlier today to get a pizza and salad to go, planning to go home with my dinner. not a big deal, or so i thought. i was told i cannot order to go, even though i had done so here two weeks earlier.  the hostess told me that they have consistency problems but they cannot accommodate orders to go, but if i wanted i could box my own pizza, and put my own salad in a take away container.  this may be the weirdestinexplicable thing i have ever heard at a restaurant.  how do you own a pizza place and you cannot do to go orders?! i was planning to pay aroung 45 for two pizzas and a salad, and youre telling me i have to box my own food? not happening.  you just lost my business, and i would say if significant front of the house changes are not made i would not return, no matter how good the dang pizza is.
first, the atmosphere is very nice. the owner and staff could not be nicer or more accommodating. we are hoping the food gets better. the pizza crust is too mushy, the tomato sauce is too sweet, and there are not enough ingredients on the pizzas. the salads are not as interesting or as fresh as they could be. also, it would be good to serve wines by the glass and they could have a better choice of italian wines. this place while not expensive is not cheap and therefore it is reasonable for customers to expect options. while we will not be going back for a while, we hope to try it again in a couple of months to see if they improve the food. we very much hope the food improves and that this very kind entrepreneur is able to make a go of it.
champaign may not be known for its pizza, but any college town will breed its own sort of pizza culture. in this town, there is a war of hand tossed, fresh ingredient pizzas with fairly normal hours vs conglomerate cheap pizza open late. antica can be added to the former, with freshly made crust, wood fired pizza, and fresh toppings like artichokes and prosciutto. this combination sounds like a pizza lovers dream. however, antica cant seem to deliver no pun intended on this revelry. situated in the heart  of the bar district, antica has a beautiful and bright open seating layout and cheerful staff. 11 pizzas vary by toppings with options for salad, gelato, and wine. the pizza, coming to about 1417, has a slightly charred crust with its bread being the star of the show. my toppings wet this magnificent yeasty treasure so i ended up swallowing a slightly soggy limp slice. the flavors were not particularly present and sauce was pretty much non existent. i so want for this establishment to do well but to satisfy my cravings, and compete with esquire, pizza m, and cheaper options, they will have to figure out how to present a slice to write home about. i wish them the best and will revisit once theyre open for a while longer.
good pizza. that aside, its too pricey for the champaign market and they close at 9 which is a terrible idea in that bar centric area. also the hostess is to be frank, just rude. its not pizza hut, really?
i went to threaded beauty las vegas back in august 2015, and i got the 3d brow strokes. after leaving that day, i was able to take a more careful look at my eyebrows, and they were definitely two very different uneven brows. they were lopsided. this was very bothersome. i also had asked parneet to send me the pictures she took of my eyebrows after she finished. she said she would, but she never did. i notified threaded beauty of my uneven brows, and i had to make an appointment to go back and get them touched up in two weeks. i went in for the touchupcorrection. i was displeased with the fact that i had to pay 50 additional for a correction after having just paid 300 for the service. afterwards, my eyebrows did look better, but they still werent exactly matching, and they arent matching to this day unless i fill them with a pencil. one is shorter than the other, and the other one sits lower at the beginning of it. my purpose for getting the 3d hair strokes was to stop having to fill in my brows daily with a pencil. fortunately, the hair is growing in, so i can begin to even them out. but, for the one brow thats longer....ill just have to wait for the tattoo to completely fade, or get someone else to make the other one match it.  parneet posts beautiful freshly done eyebrows on her ig page, and i was hoping for the same. in hindsight, i shouldve asked to see completely healed work beforehand. parneet is a sweet person, but id be much happier with her work if my eyebrows matched each other. i do like the fact that my brows appear fuller. however, the process is too painful and expensive to not be completely satisfied with the results.
lets keep it short. i was disappointed. i mean, i was happy that theres a bao shop that is easier to get to than satay brothers but in the end, its all about the bao bun and frankly, it falls way short of expectation.the flavors were decently good. i had the kimchi one which i replaced the beef for tofu. the tofu end up being the fried variety. interesting choice. probably not the best one though. kimchi being kimchi. the bun on the other hand, it wasnt fluffy at all. it was on the thinner side and small and left me hanging. i did kind of set myself up though by expecting to be smack with flavors and a dose of cloud eating instead of going in with lower expectations.hopefully, the bao will be improved and really be that fluffy goodness we all expect but for now, like their name suggests bao boys, they are still in the boys league.service was decent and all but place was dead empty when i went around lunch time so.
i was really excited when i heard that a restaurant is called bao boys will be opening up. one thing im obsessed with is bao sandwiches. theyre so good when done right. we tried both the tofu and pork belly. both were good and the flavours were pretty decent. ive had much better though.. and for the price i definitely dont think they are worth it. lets be honest, bao is all about the bun. it has to be fluffy and big. as for bao boys, their buns are tiny. i mean minuscule!!!!! no picture will prepare you for how small these buns are. there is no fluff. they are completely flat as if i was eating pita bread. i was so disappointed because i felt like i had to order three portions to even feel slightly full. if youre going to name your restaurant bao boys, make the baos unreal.banh mi boys in toronto killlll their baos. just look at the pictures. hanaer
being a buffalo native, and someone who loves chicken wings, when i heard anchor bar was coming to las vegas i was pretty pumped!! for the first time i would actually have a taste of home right in here vegas. well unfortunately, thats far from the truth. lets start with the positive, the employee taking our order was great. we were greeted promptly, and had a pleasant experience from the time we ordered until the time we received our food. if i could rate just the service is rate it 55. onto the food, where to began? well, we ordered a double wing combo comes w fries and a drink  a double order of wings hot, plus an order of stuffed hot peppers which were actually jalapeno poppers, if your from buffalo this is not a stuffed hot pepper. so we got our food, grabbed a table at the food court and began to eat. this is were the disappointment kicked in. the wings were not crispy, not even a little bit. they were very soggy.... chicken wings should not be soggy. the sauce, something about it taste different, it did not taste like their hot sauce. or maybe it was the sogginess of the wing throwing everything off. the blue cheese, didnt taste like blue cheese at all. lol, i mean i was literally in shock on how bad this was. i go back home twice a year and frequently visit the original anchor bar on main st in buffalo. i actually was just there in january, so i know something was off with the wings. the fries were actually the best part of the meal, very crispy and seasoned good. we didnt even get through the first double order before we packed the rest up in a box. i just was extremely disappointed, driving all the way down to the strip thinking i was gonna get some great chicken wings. boy was i wrong. it was bad, really bad. i spent close to 60..... i wont be doing that again. i mean buffalo is the home of the chicken wing, we have a ton of great spots like anchor bar, duffs, la nova, mister pizza, the big tree, etc.. that serve out of this world chicken wings. this location doesnt compare to those back home at all, granted its the first week they are open. hopefully they get their stuff together, quickly. until then, ill stick to johnny macs or naked city pizza.
i ordered the portobello sandwich as i was so excited to try it. i know this place is known for wings but i wasnt feeling wingey.i should of stuck to wings. the sandwich was just not good  the bread wasnt warmed all the way through so when you bit into it it was cold doughy and gross. waste of 10,   i tried my friends fries and they were incredibly salty. i tried a chicken wing boneless and not to bad. the have a buffalo spring pretty good until the after taste of plastic like taste comes in. im not sure if its because this place is new but it didnt leave a good impression. i hope it gets better.
i was very excited when i came across the anchor bar at the venetian.  i had not been to the original on in buffalo over ten years.  i planned on getting wings, but when i saw they had another specialty sandwich, beef on a weck, i wanted to have it again. staff wasnt overly friendly, but it is essentially a food court in vegas.  fries were good and so was the weck bread.  however, much of the beef was chewy and really inedible and had to toss out much of the sandwich. while i did not have them, the wings looked good.  just stay away from the beef on a weck!!
very disappointed. i got the combo bone in wings for 28. it said it come with 1620 wings and got 18. i got half salt and pepper and the other half honey ginger. the honey ginger wasnt bad but the salt and pepper was very disappointing. it had no flavor what so ever. in fact, it was plain without salt or pepper. i had to go back and they gave me some hot sauce. the fries were overcooked. im not sure how this place got four stars but i would highly suggest avoiding it.
i suppose i agree with the other reviewer who said something along the lines of its a taxi, you wont be spending your life there in regard to the obviously old fleet this company touts. problem is, however, on the two trips i took with them today, i was lessthanimpressed with both the dispatch and drivers. first i had to be somewhere at 3pm, and i called them at about 1:30 and was told id have a 20 minute wait. welp, guy never showed. called dispatch again 5 after 3, and turns out they got my hotel number wrong. dispatcher admitted it was his mistake, but gave a very audible fword because of it; not that i care as i use that french too, but if i was working somewhere i sure wouldnt use that word on the phone with a customer. anyway, when the first driver arrived his first action was to swerve through 3 lanes of oncoming traffic, again with a nice fword and horns blaring behind us. im steeled on stuff like that, but my wife was terrified. then the guy purposefully overshoots our first stop in an obvious move to get more meter time. i was feeling smart today, so i called them again and gave them a second chance on my trip back to the hotel. the second guy seemed a bit more competent at drivin, at least, but he went around his elbow to get to his hind in getting us to the hotel, so i just had him drop us off at a nearby intersection and walked it out. i dont recommend these guys, but im sure most other taxi companiesdrivers are about the same, so who knows?
i understand this restaurant opened last sunday; just wish they got a few of the kinks worked out before they opened for business. id be willing to try this place one more time and update my review, but heres how it went for us on our first visit saturday night. we called  5:20 to see if we needed reservations for a table. we explained we were about 10 minutes away. the person who answered the phone said no, and to come on down because they could seat us right away. we arrived at 5:30 and the hostess said there was a 20 minute wait. she said we could sit in the bar area. not what we wanted but we were hungry and had plans later.the restaurant has a nice atmosphere. weve waited a long time for a place like this out here in the centennial area!we ordered a beer and a glass of wine. i ordered a glass of one of my favorite whites, but our server said they were out of it.  open for 6 days and youre out? thats interesting. since we were seated in the bar area, we saw a bar tender pour the beer guinness is hard to miss and my alternate wine, and watched it sit for 15 minutes before our server picked it up. in that 15 minutes, she did come and tell us she was checking on our drinks and that she was still waiting for the bar tender to pour my wine. there were 45 bar tenders last night so im unsure of the hold up. our waitress was friendly but seemed like she was working double time. in fact, all the servers in the bar area that we could see were working hard but had more of the chicken with its head cut off thing going. drinks finally came and apps were out shortly after. we had tacos and lettuce wraps. lettuce wraps were good. tacos were fair. for dinner, i got beer can chicken and a dinner salad. my honey got a tbone steak with lobster tail, and french onion soup. it took longer than i would expect, but my dinner salad finally arrived. the soup, however, was nowhere in sight. neither was our waitress for that matter. i finished my salad, he finished his beer and nada. our waitress finally came back. she said she was checking on our food and it would be right up. she asked if we wanted another beer. we said yes, but since our food was going to come quickly, we asked her to cancel the soup. she apologized and said she would take care of it. she also said fresh bread would be out shortly. 5 minutes later....no bread, no beer, and no dinner. 10 minutes later, still nothing. but then a beer came with the promise our food would be right out. it had been another 10 minutes and we started to see a manager passing by some tables to chat. it started to dawn on us we might not be the only table having issues.with that, our waitress finally returned to tell us please sit for this one!!! the kitchen has lost your food!!!! omg  where do i start?!?! i said how is that even possible?. she told me that if 2 servers are entering an order at the same time on the computers, one order will get kicked out of the system and that no one knows where it goes. holy moly. as if that isnt bad enough, our waitress went on to tell us what a disaster they had in a previous night. apparently, the printers in the kitchen ran out of paper. for 15 minutes no orders were getting printed and she estimated that at at least 40 tables. wow. anyway.....our server was insistent we get that french onion soup after all, even though we were still telling her we didnt want it. a manager i believe his name was donnie brought the soup a few minutes later and asked us how our night was. i said we heard you guys lost our food. his response was a noticeably curt yeah, we might have!!!, and left our table immediately.  we were dumb founded. im kinda  still annoyed by his snarky response.we ate a few spoon fools of soup....then our dinner finally came! it was 7:10 pm at this point; more than an hour and a half after arriving. my dinner came correctly, but the steak and lobster tail meal was short one lobster tail. sadly, not a shocker at this point. our server didnt bring the food, but came by about 8 minutes later. we told her about the lobster and she said shed check on it. we told her not to bother at this point. she came back and said the chef says he only needs 1 and a half minutes for it. it came out 15 minutes later.another manager came to our table thank goodness not the soup guy! and their offer to make this right was to comp us drinks, and the 2 late items...lobster tail and soup. we told them that wouldnt get us back in the door. he then came back with a 50 gift card for a future visit. we understand being new and a certain amount of growing pains, but some of this was over the top not in the good way. if we had this experience at an established restaurant, we would not return. however, we would consider a second chance here...good menu and prices...but not for a little while.  hopefully they get things together soon. come on firerock!
sadly, the food at the new fire rock restaurant in nw las vegas doesnt live up to the beautiful decor. the number 1 complaint: the portions dont match the price.  complaint number 2: side dishes are bigger than the main dish or dont measure up at all. the restaurant needs to work out a lot of kinks if they want to survive.  in a town of allyoucaneat buffets, where one can get their moneys worth in a number of on and off the strip eateries,  fr doesnt understand the importance of showcasing the good stuff, rather a carb overload of not 1 but two scoops of cold potatoes in their mile high tri tip sandwhich. the sandwhich gets its 5 inch height  from the potatoes  further carbedout with a slice of texas toast on the bottom. sadly the tri tip was cut too thick and wasnt tender at all. not delicious, but reminded me of another large mound of potatoes from a familiar scifi movie. dish number 2 was the fish and chips, which for this diner was possibly the best fish ever to hit this landlocked city.  unfortunately, the amount of fish was more like an appetizer portion, but the restaurant drowns out their fish by another cart of carbs with enough chips to feed a whale. the fish pieces were so small and only 3 were piled onto old bay french fries.  if fr would serve up a double portion of fish with half the portion of chips, that would be the best lunch and the best value for anyone in vegas. oddly, a very small portion of cole slaw 2 bites...no joke was left to drip all over the other food on the plate.  fr should invest in ramekins...side salads the healthy stuff were way to small for anyone interested in a nice nutritious start to their meal. dish 3 was the fish sandwhich.  delish, but again way too many fries and no cole slaw even 2 bites would have been a nice companion onnext to the fish sandwhich. they use the perfect role and include a flavorful sauce which made up for some fry shortcomings.dessert was a diabetic disaster and to further the point about portions and price, the chocolate cake came with 2 scoops of ice cream and was more than these 3 diners could handle, but the price was less than the fish and chips?? the folks are really pushing the carbs at fr.bottom line: give them a few weeks to figure it out and hopefully youll be served a great main dish with a nice side.
i rate this 2 stars for the seafood management too. wife and i went to the newbie in the area because the seafood was supposed to be good. i have to dispute that on 2 of three counts. we were seated near the bar and man was it noisy. other people seated near the bar and front door moved away but we already had our pepsi so we stayed put.we started with a shrimp app that was tasteless, bland  wo seasoning it seemed. 1i ordered the scallops over spinach 4 scallops 25 but only ate 1 12 and our pets got the rest. the way they were cooked had an odd taste to them making the not very good. the spinach was good however. wife had the mahi and liked it even though their pricing is high. i asked for the manager and aaron came over and after talking to him he offered me a desert which i declined because i wanted a good dinner and not desert. aaron was definitely looking at the bottom line for the day and did not care to much for local repeaters coming back. his loss as we eat out at least 3 times a week. our waiter darryl was a good guy and we tipped him so. maybe after the taste comes back to my mouth we will try a steak or maybe lunch first but they really need to lower the bill of fare as this is centennial hills and not the strip. come on aaron, take care of the people and we will take care of you. sorry to start out this way too as we were looking for a new eatery.
we heard about this new restaurant in centennial and decided to try it today. it was a gloomy rainy day today and perfect for trying out a new lunch spot. we got in and were greeted with friendly faces and seated right away. everything seemed ok until we sat at our table. we quickly noticed that it was raining inside as well!! their ceiling is leaking in several spots. then the flies. it was so annoying trying to read the menu or try some appetizers with flies buzzing your face and ears. we tried the philly cheese steak egg rolls... fail. they were so bland and reminded me of something from the great value line of food products from walmart; definitely took me back to my college days where you ate the cheapest food you can find. ordered my daughter 19months the broccoli and cheese.. gerber little chefs makes a tastier version of this simple dish broccoli and cheese. fire rock version tasted like steamed unseasoned broccoli with the cheese sauce being a mixture of kraft mac and cheese powder pack with water.. horrible. the only palatable item ordered, was my glass of pepsi. i gave the place 2 stars cause they have some good potential. seems like they need an overhaul with their chef and kitchen crew. i myself have over 16 years of culinary experience and this seems like the type of place where the chef is somebodys husband, family member, or close friend who is only there for that specific reason. hopefully we can return after a few months when they realize they need to make that change in the kitchen.. start from the top and work your way down. if you think im being too dramatic... look at the photos other people have posted, or go see for yourself. sloppy and amateur.
to get an idea of the ambiance, level of food quality   think olive garden.    it feels like you are sitting in one.  the tomatoe and basil pasta was drowning in oil.  very unhealthy, and i kid you not about 1.5 cm of oil at bottom of the bowl.  the pistachio bass   again very oily, and bass was farm raised.  the steaks on the menu   might as well go to echo rig at tivoli as its the same price, and guarantee echo and rig will be be better.  average.  if you go here, think of olive garden or chilis.
the service was amazing.  my waitress, kahla thank you, management!! i wanted to give her credit but i couldnt remember her name! was great.i ordered the shrimp and strawberry salad, which was 12.99.  it came with three shrimp.  three.  im not sure if the chef overcooked them or if the marinade was supposed to taste like brine.  i wasnt impressed.  the dressing was good but very sweet with the strawberries and the crusted walnuts, so became overly sweet.  the jalapeno burger was good, had a nice flavor, but not outstanding or remarkable.  the prices do not yet justify the food.  three shrimp in a huge salad is not a shrimp and strawberry salad.  its a walnut and strawberry salad with 3 shrimp thrown in that after eating i wish i hadnt.  the menu hasnt been developed yet enough to have any stand out items, and while the service is amazing, the food is lackluster and dull.
so i just had my first experience at firerock and it was extremely disappointing. i was very excited that there was a new restaurant in the area but it did not live up to the hype. so i work in the service industry and i work on the strip. so im used to crappy people and busy days. but for a saturday at 2 pm there was nothing busy about firerock. when we were sat  a table of 3 we werent greeted for 5 minutes to be told she will be a minute. then casually waited another 10 minutes just to get our drink order but by that time we were ready to order food. i asked a few questions about the menu and she didnt know how any of it tasted. she also brought out a thing of bread instead of beverages first. we asked for both water and ordered alcohol. but what i did ordered cioppino was terrible. it was described in a spicy red sauce which was really tomato sauce with huge whole tomatoes in it. it also had 3 mussels, 2, shrimp, and 1 scallop. not to mention the worlds smallest king crab leg sticking out the bowl for decoration. it was miserable. my boyfriends ribeye was overly fatty but well cooked and seasoned. thats the only reason they are getting two stars. his sweet potato fries were over cooked and dry. our server rarely checked on us and was two busy talking to another table of women her age and just gabbing it up. im glad someone got good service from her cause we surely didnt. but after i put my plate aside and it was barely eaten. she asked if it was a good recommendation. i said no and gave her this exact reasoning and she still continued to do nothing. so we took the bill and left. i will never come back to firerock ever again. i spent 70 on the worst lunch date. untrained staff. and overpriced food that doesnt even taste good.
i was told this place had figured out its growing pains so i tried it again. i took out of town guest and i wish i didnt.  our oysters were cold and the servicev was slow and unprofessional. we were told several staff had been let go to fix some problems but i think there are more issues to address.
came on monday to celebrate my parents 47 year anniversary.   we were served water that tasted like they didnt rinse the sanitizer off.   it was eventually fixed.   then she poured tea that looked like tomato juice.  she also fixed that.   i was looking forward to chicken chili. it was so salty it was sent back.   she replaced the chili with fruit but not till the meal was over.   then due to a computer glitch the anniversary discount was not applied to the bill.   she offered to give a free dessert .    food was ok.  disappointed on the bad service.   not going back for awhile
been to firerock 3xs now. you know their biggest problem? they are understaffed in the dining area and at the bar the bartenders dont communicate with each other! i love their food, but their service is mediocre at best. the manager is nowhere to be seen. ive only seen him once during my visit. we prefer eating outside but they apparently cant staff that. at the bar, either its packed or if you go later the bartenders are too busy cleaning  setting up for the next day that they forget that they have customers. are they ready for prime time? id have to say no!!
my wife and i eat out just about every night. since this is very close to our home, weve eaten there 1012 times. and aug. 31 is going to be the final time. it is extraordinarily slow and the service isnt very good.we walked in last night at 6:20 p.m. there were people waiting, but it was obvious from looking around the dining room that seats were available. the hostess told us the wait was 2025 minutes, so we decided to wait. we got called for our table at 7:08. as we were led to our table, there had to be 15 tablesbooths open, which made one question why it took so long.when we sat down, the waiter came over reasonably quickly. my wife had a drink id walked up to the bar to get, but i had nothing. took 15 minutes for me to get a glass of iced tea. it was long to order, then it was very long before our food came out.my experience has been that the food is good, certainly not great. on this particular visit, my wife had the cedar plank salmon which ive had numerous times and i had the baconwrapped filet. my filet and the grilled vegetables were good. it was a solid b. my wife thoroughly enjoyed the salmon, as i have when ive had it in the past.they serve rolls with the meal in the pan, but our rolls were cold butter wouldnt melt on them.the waiter was pleasant, but slow, and didnt make any major mistakes.but all in all, we were in there for two hours and paid 90 including tip for our meal.the long waits make it not worth it for me. we wont be going back any time soon. i recommend the montana steakhouse, which is just up the street. its cheaper, the service is way, way, way better and its quick. the food is very comparable, too, and in some cases better.i never say never, but im going to give firerock a sixmonth break to allow them to work out the kinks.
we went in on monday for lunch. i had the piled high tri tip sandwich. it had a severe shortage of meat i left enough bread and potatoes for another my partner had the fish sandwich his comment was it was small and it was nothing special. i love the idea of a steak house close by  we live on my charleston  im going to try it again next week for dinner oh yeah the place looked great and was spotless. could use some sound panels was extremely noisy in the back area
came for lunch with my family, the host was great and let us know it would be a few minutes. the server was ok. the food was another thing, i ordered the pastrami slider with a side of ranch. the sliders came out with very, very little meat and a bun that could break a window. i asked to speak with a manager, which they told me they couldnt find. once the manager came over she was polite and agreed that the sliders were not up to the standards. its not my first time here and i will be back.
disappointed..no my favorite winewhite zinfandel. reisling was ok. sun dried tomato basil pastamore noodles than anything else. quiet music, comfortable chairs. i might try this again but it isnt on the top of my list.
the food is excellent but the service is poor.  tried them on a busy night and again when not busy  both times, we waited for ice tea and refills, and the food including the salads took excessive time to be brought out.  not sure if well be giving them a third chance.  same money and food selection at montana meat but much better service and ambiance.  do not recommend firerock.
today was the first and last time my husband and i will go here. the food was pretty good when my husband and i finally got it. thats the only reason why they got 2 stars we waited over an hour and 15 mins to get our meal. sad to say their colossal potato wasnt colossalas they claimed. the waitress apologized for the wait and there was a mix up in the back. she said that the meal would be comped and a manager would come over to check on us. we almost walked out just before the waitress came by to tell us about the mix up, but because the meal was being cooked and was being comped we hesitantly stayed. we did not complain or make a stink, because we understand things happen. then we got our food, the manager stopped by and wanted to see if there was anything else he could get us. thinking that we already have the meal comped we didnt want to take advantage of the generosity and told him that there was nothing else we wanted or needed. then we get the bill and it was not comped like the waitress stated earlier. instead they took 14 off the bill. we will not be back. and i would suggest that they not lie to their customers.
wasnt impressed the first time i came here, but i decided to give it one more try since there really isnt anywhere too great to eat on this side of town.pros: pretty friendly servers. only reason for the 2 stars basicallycons: horrible tasting steak, unless you like an over smoked taste, in which case...it would taste perfect.ordered a smothered chicken plate with a side of broccoli the chicken came out luke warm at best, broccoli was warmer, but cooked just a step above raw.twice we came here and it seems the average time to get your meal after ordering is roughly 3040 minutes. looks like a nice steak house, but then you get a paper table cloth and crayons?...if im going to pay 3050 for steak, can i get a real table cloth?  management was super nice and did try to settle the situation immediately. but i was already over it. last attempt for this spot...centennial hills strikes out again!
this is about the 3rd or 4th attempt by different steak restaurants in this location since 2008. i came with my family for dinner on a saturday night at 9pm. it wasnt too crowded, but the service was still a little slow n the dining room. i ordered a 12oz sirloin, med rare, and it was too tough to eat. i sent it back and ordered a ribeye; however, it was a little overcooked. needless to say, given the prices, i was disappointed and wont be returning. i dont know how long this place will last, but i wouldnt be surprised to see it closed. maybe the bar wiil keep the doors open, but time will tell.
took my granddaughter to eat here. i had eaten here before  the food was good. i should have stopped while i was ahead. we had to wait for a table which i expected on a saturday night. wait was not that long,20 minutes. got to table, took quite a while for waitress to come by. finally ordered  waited, and waited, and waited! when food came out it was awful!!!! granddaughters chicken strips were the size of her finger, shes 8. there were 3 of them, even together would not equal one at any other restaurant. her sweet potato fries were burnt!!! i sent that back! my sirloin was bloody rare, which i ordered medium rare, my baked potato was hard  cold. finally got different fries but by the time we left we had been in there one hour and 45 minutes!!!
i was extremely excited to eat here after seeing that it was finally open and reading the menu item for the real bacon burger. my wife and i were seated quickly, but then it took the waitress a long time to make it to our table. it was really not busy at all that night, so i thought she might be on break. this was par for our service all night. she was great when she was there, but she was rarely there to fill our drinks or see if things were alright. i ordered the real bacon burger with fresh cut chips and my wife ordered a steak.unfortunately everything that made it to our table was horribly bland except for the free rosemary bread. the burger was tasteless. the bacon jam was alright but there was such a small amount that it did not add any flavor to the burger. the chips were completely unseasoned. my wifes steak had no seasoning. it was cooked to temperature, but it had very little flavor.with so many moreflavorful options in the area, we will not be returning.
nope! just dont stay here. you can get the same quality hotel for about 3060 less a night.
i really wanted to like this place but is not all that , first time i went i purchased 6 smoothies mango and strawberry flavor, it tasted very watery and icy like it was just ice and not much flavor, not good at all... i had asked about any promotion or specials but i was given a business card so i could 9follow their social media. my second time i got one chai tea which was another disappointment very plain it tasted like it was made in a lazy way, then the girl asked if i had a stamp card and i explained i had asked but i didnt received one. yes the staff is very  friendly but the drinks are not all that.
like a real irish pub, the food here leaves much to be desired. been twice now. disappointed both times. the fish and chips features a frozen fish with heavy breading and a side of peas reminiscent of gerber. the veggie curry was a total rip off for 13 as it is literally a bowl of potatoes and carrots that i could make at home for something like 23 dollars at most. on top of that, they refused to substitute side items for the workmans burger. our waiter told us the baked beans were not chef approved whatever that means. how do you screw up baked beans? anyways, go for drinks i guess but i would recommend eating elsewhere as the pm neighborhood has many other options.
it was alright. i had a reasonably priced beer and an overpriced cheese platter that had hardly anything on it for the price you paid. the atmosphere leaves s lot to be desired because its full of people practically screaming because its so packed in there. the staff was friendly and prompt. i probably will not be back due to the atmosphere and prices and quality of the food.
they froyo is not yummy at all. its a total bummer. all flavors taste terribly and too sweet. i have gone twice  thinking the first time was a fluke but it was terrible today too. the owner is very nice but the service is extremely slow. ordering bobo tea takes 1015 mins  its insane. there is nothing better than the plain vanilla tart froyo, its a unique flavor. the tart plain vanilla at yummies is cloyingly sweet and a huge disappointment. oh well  there is always yogurt land its soooo delicious
i really enjoyed the selection of proteins at texas de brazil. the sirloin, skirt steak, and filet mignon were exceptionally moist and tender. however, they were over seasoned with salt so you couldnt taste the quality of the meat. the lamb chops, chicken, and pork were presented as an understatement, however they were some of the best ive had. i wish there was a vegetarian option like tofu and grilled veggies for vegetarians, vegans, etc.      the side dishes were mediocre. the cinnamon and sugar plantains didnt marry with the rest of the meal. in fact, it tasted like an overly sweet starbucks frappiccinno compared to the fatty meat. the mashed potatoes were extremely creamy and buttery, which complemented the lean chicken breast. the bread was a traditional brazilian bread with cheese. however, it tasted like an boring roll with string cheese from the school cafeteria.      for dessert, i ordered the creme brulee, which i was impatiently waiting for. it tasted intensely of orange which is never a bad thing and weirdly enough, mayo? it also had the texture of chunky sausage gravy. i recommend that the chef whisk more air bubbles into the custard mix, so it becomes more creamy and airy. even though there were some things wrong with the meal that was served to me today, i will always enjoy the ambience and party scene of texas de brazil!
this place is way overrated.  salad bar selections are good and fresh but all the meats are way overcooked.  you can ask the server for more on the rare side but they seem to just say yes it is  and slice the piece of medium to med well. all the meats are very salty toothe staff is pretty friendly.  they are not flexible at all though if you want to combine coupons or offers. the manager the night i was there was kind of a pompas dick. not very sincere.
next time ill skip the overpriced food and just have a glass of wine:  meat, and i tried 3 types was tough, devoid of taste and overcooked.  salad bar, really who has salad bars anymore.  sides of bananas and mashed potatoes not edible.  two stars was generous!
pretty much impossible to find in a hidden shopping center. once you find it though, it is easy to remember. vibe is nice, decent amount of seating. the issue came when we went to order. the barista male was such a jerk. my husband went to ordered, got looked up and down and scoffed at. then, the menu lists two different prices for smoothies so we assumed a smalllarge kind of deal. my husband ordered a small smoothie and proceeded to receive a lecture about how they only have one size, oh my god, it only comes it one size. forgive me, almighty man, didnt know. it continued for the rest of the order. cold brew was pretty good, but id never return on the off chance that angry homeboy was there. sorry for all the great people that im sure work there. we were the only people in line too.
i just love that i found another independent coffee shop, we definitely need more.  i had a soy cortado here and received it curdled.  the barista did make me another, but it too was curdled. he said it happens all the time with soy milk, coffees acidity with the soy milk wasnt good. i have had many soy cortados and they have been smooth and delicious. he didnt appear to be interested in learning from me how to make a smooth one. sad, as i was hoping to come back.
husband and i were on our way to one of our fav breakfast places and decided to be spontaneous and try somewhere new. we found over easy on yelp and didnt even realize it was part of the yard in tempe! ive been to the yard in phoenix and absolutely loved it so i had hopes for this one as well. as someone who has worked in the food service industry as a server for numerous years i feel like i let things slide because i know how crazy things can get sometimes. this was unfortunately not the case at over easy. the hostess took our name down and gave us the standard 1015 minutes. it was not busy, and we were the only people waiting to be seated, there were a couple of tables that were open, and i figured the hostess was giving the server in that section a little time between tables. standard stuff in the restaurant biz, and totally understandable. we perused the rest of the facility for maybe 2 minutes and then returned to the seating area. another couple walked in and she told them she would seat them in a second. she then seated them immediately completely disregarding us, so of course i stood up right next to the host stand, she realized she had messed up and sat us at the next table she could. oh did i mention she was smacking her gum? i know its a lax environment but gum smacking is just unprofessional, period. our server was sweet and probably the only redeeming part of our experience. food was average. and although i appreciate servers taking plates away, we werent completely done eating one of the plates that was taken.the last part was what sealed the deal for me. a large party was then waiting to be seated and a couple of tables around us had gotten up, it was pretty obvious that they were going to seat them and just needed our table, again, we were not done eating yet, and the hostess comes over and starts taking everything off our table, including water cups, coffee, everything. then says sorry when i tell her im not finished. still smacking her gum by the way. im sad we had such a crumby experience and will definitely not be back to over easy. i typically love fox concepts restaurants, but this one has fallen short. :
i live a few blocks away and i love breakfast, so im really pulling for this place to get their act together. this review is aimed squarely at management. i want your restaurant to survive! stop making this so hard!ive gone to the farmers ave over easy three times. each visit was on a sunday. each visit it wasnt particularly busy.1 the food is pretty solid. thats why im pulling for them to right this ship.2 both times the service has been beyond bad. despite us each time being the servers only table, we couldnt get a drink refill to save our lives. the servers all look particularly unhappy and miserable. perhaps the manager isnt easy to work with, but they drop off your first round of drinks, and then youre left to literally wave them down each time you want more diet coke or water. i had to wave down our waitress three times this last sunday to get a refill on my diet coke the cups are very, very small. the waitresses are all behind the large counter and they seem to be more preoccupied with counting receipts, or wrapping silverware, or being on their phones. they dont look up. they dont even talk to each other. they look pretty unhappy to be at over easy.3 this last visit i went to order an omelet and the waitress told me they were out of bacon and ham. pretty much the only thing more ridiculous for a breakfast place to be out of would be eggs. its bacon and ham! thats like half your menu, gone!honestly, if i didnt know better, i would think theyre trying to make this place go out of business. the food isnt as good as tempe favorite ncounter, but over easy is at least as good as tempes snooze. the difference is that a snooze hasnt run out of bacon and ham, and b snoozes servers apparently dont hate their jobs.
had to update my review. this place went from great to average in a short amount of  time. i have been going here almost every weekend for months. my last two experiences have not been good. on one, they were out of bacon, and instead of hash browns, they served potatoes sliced that were undercooked and tasteless. on the other, i recognized that the hash browns were not cooked properly, and the bacon which was amazing in the past had changed. there is also a significant drop off in the service. my pancake arrived when i was almost finished with my meal, and not once did they offer to refill my coffee. you can watch, what appears to be the manager, working away at the counter on a laptop, and never lift one hand to help when its busy. i feel they are understaffed, have resorted to inferior ingredients, and basically will not survive if they continue with average food and service, when there are so many options. my weekend breakfast spot is going back  to ncounter, even though its a bit farther walk, have never been disappointed there. wanted over easy to kill it since its so convenient to where i live, but instead, i think its already dead.
that place is so shady! we ended up there because we were looking for a latin night. the music was ok but it just felt weird being there.
people of edinburgh, i hope this isnt your only bubble tea option. i was let down. the taste was totally ok, but the pricing and general options were the big disappointment. a bubble tea place that charges for boba? seriously? most all other spots give you either tapioca boba standard or one choice of boba standard. obviously extras cost extra, but chatime charges for anything  which seems to kind of defeat the point of calling yourself a bubble tea shop. the pricing is also rather ridiculous. i wouldve found it expensive in london. but i was in edinburgh where im always happy for the slightly lower cost of things. highly doubt ill be going back here on my next visit. the lychee green tea was fine enough, but not worth the kajillion pennies it cost me. :
138 dollars for eggs and pancakes, tea and chocolate milk, 2 adults 1 senior and a toddler.i was charged 9dlls for a side of bacon 2 strips of bacon this place is a ripoff!. i was told that they are under new management but this place has been historically bad...my advise is dont eat here might as well hit the buffet you will pay less and have a lot more variety. btw i order the skinny omelet and it was not good at all...the service was ok the food took quite a while everything else pancakes and eggs where just ok not great not worth the money...
took the server 15minutes to come to us. shockingly overpriced. got our order wrong. gave us stone cold fries. the pizza and chopped salad were ok, nothing special. we also came here the night before for one piece of grilled chicken takeaway for our dog, and it took about 30 minutes or more.
food was great but the service sucks had to ask for a refill on the coffee 3 times before i got it
over priced! good food, but way to expensive to eat here frequently.  ive eaten here twice now one server was great and the other one was not. had to ask for our water to be refilled and for another cocktail. we sat with our glasses empty for a while. anyway, blah.
first, let me say that the staff is very nice, really great people running the place.the space is clean, organized and completely modern inside, i love that.im on the fence about the treatment.  i had my foot done.  i have pain and swelling after surgery.  if there was any  difference at all it was so slight it wasnt noticeable. later i didnt feel too good about paying 50 for the 10 minute session and not really getting any results.so my biggest complaint is the price, way too much for an experiment.i suggest waiting until groupon has a special like they do now full body for 37 and try it then.  that way you wont feel foolish spending the  if its not  for you.
they dont have a proper alcohol license, so youre forced to buy food if you come in for a drink, which is pretty annoying. literally everyone at the table has to order a meal item. the food wasnt terrible though.the waitstaff was friendly, but quite anal about little things, probably because of the very large surly manager, who was rather unpleasant.the music was all bad 90s pop.the decor is pretty nice although they leave chalk to write on the walls in the bathroom and i read some... interesting things there. the terrace is pretty barren and could use some decor.overall, this bar feels like the burgundy lion but with worse music, no liquor license, and a jerk manager. i think theres better around.
youll have to order food if you wanna drink in this newly opened griffintown pub. a standard pub which the area needed with the burgeoning population of condos. the lamburger was good. the terrace is not even open till 1am.
we love vince clothing, but shopping at the actual shop at scottsdale quarter has its drawbacks.  they have a 30 day return policy thats it!!  after 30 days you have to keep the item you dont like or that doesnt fit you.  no store credit, no other options. i dont see why i would ever shop here again when nordstrom will return for store credit no matter when you return it.  they all carry the same items, so its not like you have a better selection at the vince shop.  i dont think ive ever experienced a shop not returning something.  i was going to purchase a christmas gift and we were going to purchase something for more than our original return so, not only did they lose 2 sales, they lost me as a customer to nordstrom. i have a shop and we have a strict return policy, but i have never made someone keep something they dont want.  its about customer relationships to me and not about one individual sale.  glad i learned this lesson before i started christmas shopping as vince is one of my goto gifts.
poor service. waited for more than 15 mins and finally called someone that works there because no one even bothered to talk to us. never will we go back to this place!!
apparently this place is fairly new but i was surprised to see only one other party seated when we arrived. id read some reviews on this place duh and a lot of reviews had one thing in common: the silverwaredishware were dirty. so, as expected, the tea cups was beyond disgusting and i immediately requested new ones.the language barrier between the waitress and us was so bad that she had to go get one of her colleagues to translate. that is perfectly fine  i am all for that; it makes the place feel more authentic  but maybe put someone on the floor that knows even the tiniest bit of english or at least enough that she can take an order :the food was good but not exceptional. my favorite was the beef with bean paste and that was pretty much the only dish that left an impression. we also tried the sweet and sour soup, which was too bland for my taste. the pork buns were good but a bit too chewy, almost as if they were undercooked.this place is so close to home that im actually a bit sad that it isnt better. i dont think ill be going back any time soon.
good food, garbage service and lack of everything else.this coming from an asian knowing how bad asian service already is and this is worst.
all gifts from the heart are not created equal...and fortune seafood restaurants fell a little flat gratuitous reference for the 0.89 of the world that speaks cantonese.there are certainly better options in vegas for dim sum. the real crime is that the worst items we received were seafood items...your name has the word seafood in it...make sure its fresh! we came in on a saturday around 11:30am to find a relatively empty dining room with only a few other tables occupied. we had a sense that it wasnt going to be that great, but you can only judge 95 of books by their covers...plus we felt obligated to stay and write a review since there werent a lot of reviews to go off in the first place. the service was great!...fast and attentive.  we ordered many of our favorites and few other items:har gow shrimp dumplingssiu mai pork siu maipai gwut pork ribsnor mai gai sticky rice in lotus leaf with some mysterious substancehom sui gok glutinous rice dumplings w mushroom  porkdaan taat egg tartliu sha bao salted egg yolk custard bunssteamed scallop dish almond tea bund with lotus seedwe generally eat all that we order, or at the very least take the leftovers home. there were two dishes that were bad enough that we didnt want to finish them: har gow shrimp dumplings  the steamed scallop dish. the seafood was certainly not fresh, spoiling the dishes. the simple choice is to find a different restaurant. if you do find yourself here, without the options of leaving, you would do best to stick to the pai gwut pork ribs and hom sui gok glutinous rice dumplings w mushroom  pork. still there was nothing good enough to recommend outright and certainly nothing to bring us back.
i dont know if they just opened and was short on staff but i hate to say that the service was not very good... the hostess walked us to our table and did not ask us if we wanted any beverages. we did not have utensils or condiments. there wasnt much of an option on the dim sum. only two carts did one round and it wasnt as fresh.. we did not have device for awhile after that. the chowmein we ordered for the kids tasted bland. this place needs better service.
the veggie combo i got here has the unfortunate distinction of being both the skimpiest and the priciest ive ever been served, and ive ordered them in 11 cities and four time zones. my first thought when it was served was, wait ... is that an appetizer? my plate came with the requisite lentils and cabbage, as well as pureed potatoes in place of the customary solid ones. the two problems with the servings: their size, given that the plate they were served on was largely injera, and a lack of variety. id been hoping for greens and yellow split peas, which commonly come with vegetarian combos along with salad greens. i was tempted to order kitfo  raw beef  to fill out my plate but took comfort in the fact that at least my bill likely would be small. surely, a veggie combo thats half the size of some ive been served elsewhere would be half the price, right? quite the contrary; my bill was more than 14 for about 7 worth of food.the restaurants atmosphere is a saving grace; its bright and inviting. theres free wifi; you just have to ask an employee for the password. and while ive had to work to get employees attention at some other ethiopian restaurants, that wasnt the case here. people were quite friendly. based on some other reviewers pics, perhaps visiting here as part of a group results in getting more food and better variety. but if your solo experience is anything like mine was, the results will be underwhelming for both your palate and your pocketbook.
it feels strange to say, but ive had much better ethiopian food in kentucky. i guess louisville is more cosmopolitan than we give credit.i got the veggie combo, and the review from brian s. is spot on. mine was not quite as skimpy as his because i got an additional serving of beets which i hate. i missed the greens too. when i had the misir wat red lentils in kentucky, the dish was so good that i was looking up recipes for it when i got home. abyssinias version was lackluster in flavor although it did have a spicy bite. the only thing that i really liked was a smooth reddish brown puddle. im not sure what it was, but it was really tasty. the funny thing is my husband had the same looking puddle on his chicken plate, but he said it tasted differently. he left it untouched. his chicken got eaten up, but he wasnt wowed by it in any way.the owner served us with a big smile, and that is worth a lot. i wouldnt come back, but im glad there was a yelp deal to prompt us to give it a shot.
pretty bummed and disappointed in this place. my girlfriend and i have been waiting to splurge for lunch at this place. when we walked in the place looked very modern. we ordered with a cashier clerk and told her it was our first time. she seemed to be in a rush and did not give us any suggestions from the menu. we decided on the salmon and brown rice with steamed veggies. we were incredibly hungry and anticipated our delish salmon dish that our friend had told us about. when our buzzer went off i walked up and redeemed my plate. i sat down and my gf and i quietly began to eat. she pointed out that the veggies were uncooked.... which made me want to question the salmon. however, the salmon was cooked well. the brown rice was served cold too, which did not make me feel good about my purchase. also, the calamari dish that we ordered was okay. i can not say that i will be back to give them a second chance...
the food was ok, i guess. it just seemed overpriced for food served on a paper plate.  my wife got the prawns which were served unpeeled, complete with the legs. i was disappointed that the coleslaw was actually a cabbage salad with dressing on top, rather than mixed together.  the crispy scallops were more breading than scallops.  but we really likes the tomato beans, and they had good flavors.
all the food was cold by the time it got to the table. they forgot three of the items we ordered and after their third trip back to the table they finally got it right. went with a couple other people and tried a variety of items. prawns had no taste. scallops were okay for the first couple but as they rapidly lost any heat they started to taste like bread crumb balls. garlic fries were beyond salty, and as someone who puts salt on their salt, that is saying something. the clam chowder was very disappointing. the java calamari tasted like maple syrup on a  flavorless chewy substance. the one redeeming factor was the staff. they were very nice and checked in on us through out the meal.
outstanding flavor and a decent price. just need to find out where their fish come from. if usa in origin, thats great. if vietnam or other asian country.....might make it more harmful than healthy.   will post when i find out.update. not the healthiest of fish and spotty service. change from 4 to 2 stars
this location seems cursed with restaurants that open with good concepts and poor execution.  i got the combo white fish and chicken with creamed corn and salad.  the fish was not cooked, very grey and limp in appearance and the chicken is that weird kind that comes in cheap teriyaki bowls.  the salad was inedible with very tough tomatoes.  the creamed corn was okay but had way too much cream.  my friend got the popcorn shrimp and clam chowder and didnt like either.  i do not recommend.
overall the salad roasted veggie salad had a decent flavor, but the portions are very small considering the price i paid about 11.50 for the salad with added chicken.  the chicken wasnt overly flavorful either.ill probably give them another shot since they just opened, but im not overly impressed quite yet.
the salad ingredients are fresh and the roasted veggies are pretty good.  while there are some good healthy choices and a juice bar, there are some issues that need to be addressed such as the efficiency of service, employees understanding the menu, and pricing of certain items.  they seem to have a bit of a nickle and dime mentality, which isnt the greatest business model especially for a new restaurant that people are experiencing for the first time.
more like 2.5 stars. first of all i just want to say, great staff. friendly people who give good service and seem to care. my issues are with the product itself. i went in there to get lunch one day and ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and when i got it i was incredibly disappointed. for starters it was so small i finished in like 5 bites, and when paying 9 for a wrap i would like a little bit more than that. secondly, the chicken was a little bit below room temperature and there were only like 4 little pieces on the wrap. again, total ripoff for 9. if there is an option to get it toasted i wouldnt have known because i was never asked. finally, my last problem is the pricing of juices and smoothies. some of them are upwards of 7 just for a 16oz., and that is not including addons such as protein, which are between 1 and 2 each. i understand the issue that produce are expensive but come on! some of the most expensive juices only had 4 ingredients in them! i could just as easily go to nekter two minutes down the road and get a 24 oz. juice for that price, and all of their addons are only a dollar. great staff, horrible product.
i was excited to see this place open and thought it would be great have another lunch spot in the area. the experience was disappointing.as others have mentioned, they really do nickel and dime you. i was originally planning to get the 11 grilled shrimp plate, and when i asked if i could substitute the rice with veggies, they said that there would be a 2 charge. come on...are veggies really that much more expensive? just substitute it! this is not a way to do business. i wasnt going to pay 13 for shrimp and veggies from a walkuptothecounter place!i thought i would go with the cheaper 10 grilled shrimp salad. i asked for dressing on the side, but when i got my order, the dressing was mixed in; they also forgot to add the roasted peppers. the most ridiculous part was, it came with three small shrimps; the bulk of it was spring mix. i spoke with the lady that put my order together and she confirmed that the salad does only come with three shrimps, but that she would remake the salad without the dressing. the lady was friendly and the manager checked up on me at some point, but that was the only positive part of my visit. the salad was boring and unsatisfying. for that price, they could at least add avocado, an egg, or something more filling....perhaps more shrimp?i hope they get their act together. for now, be prepared to spend a good amount of money and leave hungry. i am sure they are making a whopping profit!
i was disappointed in the 4 topping selection. there was not 4 topping that i liked but even though i only choice one topping i could not get cheese without paying another .75 cents. why would anyone pay 7 for lettuce and cheese! no second chances!!
no redeeming qualities to this place.  very poor value for the price and theres nothing spectacular about the food quality that would make me want to come back either.  its been 3 months and i havent seen any meaningful improvements to the service, menu, or food quality.  ill go back only if im in a jam and starving but with other choices in the area this isnt on my list.
the chicken is awful!! it doesnt even feel like its chicken... it was soo awful that at first we didnt even think that it was chicken. the vegetables were still frozen. but the soup was great! the bowl of soup was huge. the best part about the place were the spring rolls.
food is good but customer service was sub par.   we got no plates to eat off of, waited about 30 minutes before being asked if we were ready to order, then another 30 minutes after being served our first dish.
i like searching for hot and new spots on yelp and stumbled upon sushi way, with 4.5 stars, it was a no brainer to come here. my wife and i came here during lunch, it was not busy so we were seated at the bar very quickly. the service was friendly but forgetful. apps we ordered did not come out when first ordered. now for the main event unfortunately the sushi, pretty much all of the rolls we ordered were bland, no flavor, no taste. it was weird, nigiri was good but still did not hit the spot. probably will not come here again but well see.
i was super excited to try this place. im always looking for new ayce sushi restaurants and usually yelp doesnt let me down. however, i was disappointed tonight. the service  our server was training a new person. both of them were nice, but about halfway through the meal our server let the trainee take over and she didnt seem to have any idea about the menu, which roll was which, or even basic sushi terminology. also, at one point the sushi chef told our server to not let us order more until we were finished with what was on the table... since i dont really like sushi rolls, and i had finished all the nigiri i ordered, i had to wait until my 3 other dinning companions had finished their rolls. ive never experienced that before. the food  very underwhelming. we started with some apps... the mussels were okay, nothing special, and had way too much eel sauce. the salmon tartare was super bland, but the nachos were flavorful. the hamachi kama was over cooked, but the portion size was good. tempura was just ok, too. the best one was the poke, it was spicy and full of flavor, but when we ordered a second one it wasnt spicy at all. they were like two completely different dishes.all of the rice was super mushy. i tried to order a spicy scallop hand roll but they wouldnt make it for me. they gave me a yum yum scallop roll instead, that had absolutely no flavor. i cant really speak to the rolls, but as we were leaving, one of my friends said he wouldnt go back because he wasnt impressed with the rolls he had. overall, it was such a disappointing experience. well be sticking to sushi mon or goyemon for our late night ayce sushi fix.
this was my third visit. im usually a pretty good tipper so when i came on today for a polish change i expected to be treated fairly, if not well. the manicure fix was a good one, ill admit, though not exactly what i asked for so when i was prepared to tip 50 on the listed price for a polish change and was told an amount three times what is on their price list i was flabbergasted. when i called them out they knocked 5 off the ripoff price and i paid without leaving a tip. i will share my experience and i will not be back.
while the staff was pleasant the wait was very long for only having two customers in the shop as they also had two employees helping the one customer. after being helped i selected the black cherry cheesecake to go. i was very let down by the product. i normally love cheesecake but this one was flavorless, i was expecting much more as they charge 6 dollars for a personal cheesecake.
background my boyfriend is a former hibachi chef and i used to a work at a different japanese express. so we can be kinda picky but tbh this place is overpriced for the quality of the food. the rice was extremely dry almost like it wasnt cook. i could not even finish my food bc the rice was so hard. on top of that the shrimp sauce didnt really taste like it at all it probably could have used more mayo it taste more like sweet sour sauce. the only reason why i am giving it 2 stars is because the sushi was actually pretty good other than the presentation and price. i personally thought many of the rolls were pretty pricy for a japanese express joint but maybe it was pricy because they are offering 20 off? im gonna cut them some slack because they are new but dry rice is a deal breaker for me. i will not return.
i got suckered in....theyre new and offering 20  off on your entire purchase. what did you expect? im a foodie. anyhoo.....since they are the new kids on the block, the place was empty when i arrived, a quick check of the menu and i knew i wanted to try the filet mignon hibachi. it comes with your choice of rice brown, steamed, fried and a mix of broccoli, carrots, onions, mushrooms and zucchini.i didnt have to wait long for my order which was impressive since i assumed they prepare each order as you request it. i opted for togo and the presentation still looked good when i got home. the steak was okay im being generous, not quite cooked as i requested and it was just lukewarm and could have used a tad bit more seasoning. but i managed to eat it. the veggies were cooked really nicely though by far the best part of the meal. the rice was awful. no flavor or veggies and it was cold. yuck. no, thank you. they have a pretty decent selection of sushi, so maybe ill go back and give that a try and update my review based on my next visit. but for now, ill pass hokkaido....
the restaurant was clean and the staff was very polite.  however the food tastes bland.  a woman sitting at the table next to me threw her plate away and said to me your sushi looks delightful, this hibachi was horrible.  i let her know the look was far from what this tastes like.
i rated this restaurant so low because we had to wait over an hour for our food, food wasnt bad but the service so bad, not sure i will be going there again.
pricey and bland.  we ordered takeout for the whole family.  spicy orange chicken sauce was ok but even with the sauce the deep fried chicken had an ultra bland taste. black pepper chicken was a little better, but overloaded with huge onion chunks and bell peppers about 81 ratio onion and bell pepper to chicken.  crispy spring rolls were also a dud.  the place was packed, but it was 7pm on a friday night and its new to the area.  my wife said the tofu was descent.  long story short id go to pei wei or pf changs 10 out of 10 times over this place.
have you heard the npr episode where the seafood industry has a problem mislabeling the species of seafood sold and served? the story goes on to discuss an urban myth that pig bungholes are repurposed and sold as calamari strips. i want to tell you; its not an urban myth. i had them yesterday at flos new restaurant in tempe. flos calamari appetizer was as chewy, inelastic, and muscular as you might imagine a pigs bunghole to be. even my dog, who likes a nice chewy rawhide occasionally, only ate one and left the remainder in her bowl. i avoided the garbage disposal for fear the motor would burn up trying to macerate the tough overprocessed protein.the entree we shared was the chicken fried rice. it was nothing special. we also shared a 16 oz. bottle of tsing tao beer, my favorite, but we wondered when we paid the 33.00 tab if well ever be back. and its a shame, flos location is very convenient to where we live.i have to add, our server bethany, was charming and attentive to our requests. for bethany, we give the extra star otherwise flos only deserves one star.
the food was good, i just took issue with what how they decided to handle a challenge. i ordered my lunch and was given the option of white or brown rice, i chose brown. i was never notified of an issue with my choice and when the waiter brought the food, he dropped it and said we are out of brown, it will take 15 minutes to cook so i got you white. he never asked if that was ok, never mentioned the problem until my food was in front of me.  on top of that there was no apology or service recovery. i just felt it was just handled poorly with little regard for my happiness.
very disappointed. the menu looked great and the restaurant looks nice, but the food is just awful. ordered shrimp skewers and spicy orange chicken. the shrimp was probably the worst shrimp i have ever had. the orange chicken comes with the sauce on the side. sauce was decent but the chicken, which was breaded and fried, was awful. really chewy and had a strange texture. i know this restaurant was converted from an old mcdonalds and sadly i wished i had gone across the street to mcdonalds instead.
very average.  very overpriced.  very disappointing.  we order 90 worth of takeout to try this restaurant and will not return.  of 5 entrees and 4 appetizers, only the moo shu pork was worth recommending.  the lettuce wraps were bland...almost tasteless...and there were only 4 pot stickers per order most places its 6 or 8.  the mongolian beef was ok but the garlic chicken  kung pao chicken were average at best.dont believe the hype...the recent reviews of bryan m. and julie m. are right, flos is just plain disappointing.
great food but the service is awful. the waitress took 15 minutes to take our food order and asked for the drinks 5 minutes after the food order was placed.
my fiance and i really loved the food at karaikudi, and were hoping for a similar experience with the changes to mint. the prices went up by at least 3 per dish for vegetarian main dishes and several of my favorites are now gone. the samosas were decent, but everything else was somewhat unremarkable. add to that the fact that the server disappeared after taking our plates and we had to flag someone down to get and pay our bill. i was hoping that the changes would be subtle and it would still be the best place in town for indian food: not so much. everyone was very nice, but i cant justify paying more for food that isnt as good and subpar service. we will not be back.
im giving mint indian just 2 stars based on my experience since they have bought the restaurant from karaikudi palace. i understand when you buy a business the first thing you do is recoup and that means a gradual increase in price. ill start with the buffet, its now 15.00 per person friday thru sunday, thats more then a dinner entree, im not sure they are using halal meat, i did not see the sight above the buffet, the tuesday thru thursday charge is now 13.00 dollars per person. the choices are a little different because of a new menu and chef, i was very turned off that they didnt have the traditional rice pudding for dessert, that is a mainstay of an indian buffet. moving on with recouping, i placed a take out order and asked for some chutneys to go over the phone, when i arrived and got my check, i was charged 3.00 dollars for the 2, 1oz cups. i was a little disturbed about that being that tandoori times down the street would nver do that. to me thats asking for salsa or hot sauce and their should never be a charge for that. the decor has been updated but the service is sub par so it doesnt matter or make a difference, whats missing is sam and pandu, they were the face of the restaurant, i would have to say that the service factor has gone down having college students working in a fine dining establishment, not knowing when to approach a table to check in or clear dirty plates during the buffet service. i did notice plates piling up on the table next to us. the last thing i saw and agree with another yelper is the family and friends eating behind the bar, i have my opinion and ill let all who reads format their own. id be happy to go back but they have to figure out a few things to improvechange to be a success

i am a big fan of karaikudi. marvelously rich sauces and a good mix of entrees...chicken, goat, fish. mint indian cuisine seems mostly vegetarian, with dishes struggling to match the complexity of the richer meat sauces. i always cherish indian food, so look forward to their evolution. raised price of buffet to 11. here are some do betters...soup bowls for soup instead of styrofoam  8 oz cups, small spoons for dessert, and at least 4 desserts for a buffet, instead of 2. there was one fruit, but i wouldnt consider a single fruit dessert. most of the hour plus time i was there, the fish dish was all sauce, fish empty. i asked twice if they could bring out some fish. maybe an hour later, it arrived. since i arrived before 1pm, didnt understand why it took so long to replenish the tray. with buffets, i like to try all the dishes. since it was one of the 3 nonvegetarian, eager to try.
hi , went there with friend, it was lunch buffet. the tandori chicken was awfully burnt and the whole food was super tastelessly spicy. they didnt had any lamb dish and fish curry was awful.very expensive.i will never go there again.
food was ok...  dessert was nasty....please dont serve canned gulab jamming... the best part was the tea.
the food made me sick we ate there for lunch. it was delicious but i was throwing up all day! i had a migraine that would not go away until 10pm. i fell asleep for hours. i wonder what did they put in the food. if you want to enjoy indian food  dont go to any buffet go to a restaurant that makes it fresh! eventhough its a very nice restaurant i do not recommend going to this place because of how i felt.
totally overpriced food. 10 bucks for a burger that was decently okay? yeah ill pass next time. dont waste your money here.
i dont know how to put it as i was trying hard to work on giving this place a high review. we came in here with the high expectation as it showed on yelp as a hot and new place. the wait staff were very friendly and nice and the place looks like an old diner decorated with vintage style signage.  the waitress was a sweet older lady that was very attentive to helping our party of 5.  then came the food....my friends ham looked and tasted as if it were rubber and might have been a little undercooked. i myself ordered the blu cheese burger.  when my order came out the fries were the cafeteria type and not very tasty.  the burger lettuce was yellow and the tomato looked tired. i thought to myself, i can move that to the side and just just eat as it.  when i bit the burger, it tasted like really stale cheese....yuck...four hours later i still have the after taste in my tongue. i think they are trying, but idk if i will come back.
i came here for the 1st time a couple months ago. i got the california benedict which i could barely stomach. it had spinach on it that was wilted and slimy. the hollandaise sauce also tasted weird. my husband liked his meal so i decided to give it another shot. we went back again last weekend and this time i ordered an omelette with cheddar cheese, green onions, mushrooms, and avocados. there was way too much cheese on it which made the omelette very oily. they also forgot the avocado and the eggs were an off color and didnt taste good. i really wanted to like this place but next time the hubby will have to go without me.
not sure where i should begin with this review, the 4 stars are a bit of a stretch. the service was very good and we were seated quickly. my eggs were cold, has browns were barley done and the pancakes were okay. the area were we were seated, the waitresses make toastenglish muffins, thatss very different. this would not be my first choice for breakfast, lesson learned.
we were really bummed to discover that this neighborhood diner is nothing worth trying. although it was cute when we walked in and sat at the checked counter, the service  while friendly  was almost as bad as the food. you expect a diner to be quick  especially at the counter. this one was not. and we could see our food sitting on the warmers for a few minutes before it came to our counter seats. once it arrived, however, we sort of wished it hadnt. the chocolate chip waffle was flavorless except for the chocolate and so soggy i could barely get a bite down. a country benedict was poorly cooked, the biscuit doughy and the poached eggs practically hard boiled. the gravy wasnt bad, but nothing could save the dish as a whole  especially given the bland, barely fried portion of limp hash browns that came out on the plate as a side. we also ordered the blt on sourdough which came with crinkle cut fries. although a crinkle cut usually gives a fry more crevices to become crisp and salty, these fries were neither. a soggy pile of flavorless potatoes, i think frozen fries cooked at home in the microwave could have turned out just as well. and the bacon was fatty  and not in a good way. more like in the way that indicates to you the bacon was cheap and poor quality. and that was probably the best of our dishes!we were eager to leave after this breakfast but, again, we had to wait some time to close out, which was frustrating given how close we were to the cash register. now that were gone, we certainly wont be back.
true gritgreen life cafe wants to be all about the zen experience and fully takes advantage of its cozy setting on monroe avenue in the former location of the macha tea house.  unfortunately, they forgot about some basic restaurant tenants such as properly seasoning its food, thoroughly cleaning ingredients so customers dont get a mouthful of grit and periodically checking on its patrons during their dining experience.the restaurants cool quotient is high with fresh flowers on the tables, a citrusinfused water cooler, and plenty of hip knickknacks sprinkled though its intimate setting.  the menu is limited, a number of smoothies, coffee drinks, wraps and crepes.  the person behind the counter didnt attempt to engage me as i perused the menu to offer any suggestions.  i elected to go with the 9 falafel breakfast wrap falafel, scrambled eggs, roasted peppers and eggplant and mushrooms and paid the 1 up charge to get the freshly made sweet potato fries.  the dish looked spectacular, with the deep orange fries contrasted against the green tortilla wrap with a pale yellow curry yogurt dipping sauce.  however, kitchen failed to put any crunch on the exterior of the falafel.  both the wrap and the fries were woefully deficient of salt.  the bigger sin was that with every other bite, it felt like i bit into a grain of sand.   not cool, green life, not cool, youve got to do a better job of cleaning your ingredients.  the last disappointment was the post sale service, or more precisely, the utter lack of postsale service.  the restaurant was not exactly overrun with customers during my visit, so it disappointed me that neither front of house staff member ever checked in to see what i thought of my meal.  there are limited weekday breakfast options in this area, so i really hope that green life gets its act together.  while i will probably return at some point im a sucker for a wellprepared savory crepe, i am going to give them a couple of months to get improve food offerings and their customer service.
when they first opened i really enjoyed their wisco sandwich as well as salads. also liked their smoothies. now they got rid of their sandwiches and salads. they arent opened as advertised and their website if out of date. something is going on with them. call first before heading to them because most likely they arent open and you will waste a trip in. they could of really added a nice perk to the monroe street neighborhood but its just too inconsistent.
they serve brunch, but dont serve coffee. they have biscuits, but no jelly. i ordered the sausage hash and everything tasted like it came out of a bag. the sausage crumbles were overfried and tasteless, the potatoes had a rubbery texture, and the biscuit was chewy around the edges, a clear sign that it was frozen and then reheated. on our way out, we saw a couple with only water in front of them who were waving their hands in frustration. they got up and left almost immediately after. the place was nearly empty at the time. given the plethora of great brunch options around charlotte, this place should be low on your priority list, if at all.
great selection of beers. it would be a 45 star place if the service wasnt awful. they move at a snails pace. seriously. ive never experienced something so slow.  you can ask them over and over for another beer, but it may come 30 minutes later. it wasnt even that busy when ive been there.
not the best service or food ive had. many more options around southend that are much better. service was absolutely horrible. i never got a refill on water and was there for about 2 hours. the waitress took a while to bring our drinks. ordered a burger and it tasted like a frozen bubba burger. i had 3 bites and couldnt stomach the rest. ordered a side salad and the only options for dressing were ranch and blue cheese??? really, no oil and vinegar in the kitchen. thats concerning. asked for ranch and never got it.  last time ill be going there for food or drinks.
cool atmosphere. i came over here when it was dharma lounge and i love the changes they have made. the service is the worst ive ever seen though. i was here for over a hour and was told a server was coming, but not a single one came by. we ended up continuing to order drinks from the bar because it seemed like the server was purposely trying to avoid our table. i probably will not be coming back unless i feel like waiting forever for a beer.
i really wanted to like brass tap but there are a lot of areas they need to improve on. went there over the weekend and was sitting at a table and it took 20 minutes for the waitress to get us our order of beers. then it took 45 minutes for us to get our food, unacceptable. the food was very uninspired and was your run of the mill bar food. they really need to get their kitchen and bar service together if you cant keep it together on a fridaysaturday night you will never survive. thankfully the manager comped our food which was very nice of him. may give them one more shot because they do have a great selection of beer but the food and service is lacking.
great selection in beer, but the wait service was really bad.  came in for brunch on a saturday and took 20 min for us to get drinks after sitting down.  food came out and the panini was soaking wet on the bottom and the home fries were dry.  to end this lovely experience, took the waitress 10 minutes to bring back our check.  anyone in their right minds wanting to eat there would be crazy.  go for the beer selection and skip the food....youll live to thank me.
i wish yelp had halves so i could give a 2.5 but unfortunately the brasstap left me extremely underwhelmed. we were excited to check the place out and grab a drink and the beer list didnt disappoint  a lot of options you dont see too often so thats a plus.however, holy heck that food, eh. we were surprised about the decent prices but it made sense after we got our meals. one of our meals was the 4 meat pretzel pizza and she said personal sized but we honestly thought we were in a chuck e. cheese with how child size and doughy and mediocre it was. we also got a large tempura shrimp meal and it was just a small plate of a dozen small fried shrimp and about 6 fries. we considered another plate but after the first two and looking around, we decided against it. then after getting the bill it took about 15 minutes to get the waitress again to pay and go. so the meal and paying portion of the experience didnt pan out well. there a bunch of tvs and the patio is a nice touch but the decor felt a little too dark and dungeony for a place trying to give off a laid back vibe. all in all, we give second chances so well probably go back to try other meal options and hopefully itll be better but if not, i wish this wasnt so but its just not a place i see frequenting too often.
i came here in the middle of summer. i understand that its hot in the south in the summer, but good lord it was a furnace in this place. they had a great beer selection, and the food, on paper, looks good. however, my meal the prime rib nachos was nothing to write home about.  the service was less than average. it was near impossible trying to get the server back to the table. i came here because i had a coupon, but i dont see myself returning to pay full price. i believe they had only been open for a short while at the time of my visit, so maybe that was the problem.
this place felt like a poor carbon copy of several other bars. the draft selection at duckworths is far better and the atmosphere at brass hovered between a dive bar and chain bar without really committing to either. also, the service at the bar was... grumpy. dont know if he was having a bad day, but he put a hell of a damper on our day buzz beer crawl. we only lasted one beer there before moving to the next spot.this place is right next to wooden robot which is why we tried it. proximity not quality was the deciding factor. next time well walk a little farther.
i went to brass tap with girlfriends for a drink and appetizer. we ordered from the extensive beer menu and some waters since we came from yoga. we sat waiting a good while for our beers and we were never served water until asking a couple more times. i am a big fan of buffalo chicken dip. of course our group ordered it to snack on since we were starving and things seemed to be moving pretty slow. the dip was nothing to brag about but what got me were the stale chips. i wouldnt order it again. i ended up not even ordering anything to eat. the server wasnt helpful and we felt that we were an inconvenience. overall i was pretty disappointed. the staff working that night seemed as though they didnt want to be there and it brought the energy of the entire place down. this place has a lot of potential. i may give it a try in the future again.
we walked in and saw a beautiful lemon bar that we had to have since we love lemon. all i can say is im glad we bought only one to share. it was dry and not nearly lemony enough. for the price i expected better.
overpriced airport food.  quality is questionable.  staff is nice. stale buns and chewy burgers.  unfortunately, they have a captive audience so there is no incentive to change.
sorry omy sushi, i really wanted to like you better. but alas, that was not the case.we saw the reviews and were excited to have a yummy ayce sushi place by our house.upon walking it, hit by the overwhelming smell of dirty frying grease. yuck! and i wish i was exaggerating! we had to wash our clothes when we got home. it was disgusting.we ordered the sashimi salad, which had a picture in the menu that looked tasty! seasonal greens topped with a yummy selection of thick fresh sashimi. what we got was a fist full of iceberg lettuce and some paper thin slices tossed on with out care, dressing on the side. the good part, the dressing was actually pretty good!we had some confusion on the sushi, we ordered one special roll, and received another. our waitress told us it was a typo on the menu, and that the right name was on another roll a few down......ummmmm ok. we got that worked out, still not very good, sadly. neither were the other rolls we ordered.i sat wondering, how can this place have all these 5 star reviews? what are we missing? or are we hitting a bad night? then i look over and see a sign on the table that stated with your great yelp review, you get a free beverage and a complimentary tea cup to take home. ok... so i guess a lot of people needed the free drink? or the tea cup?? am i the only one that finds this a bit odd? coercing good reviews for free schwag?regardless, we will probably not go back. bummer!
fish quality is ok, no fresh wasabe available and service is slow  incompetent! they kept forgetting what we ordered and the service was so slow that we had to leave two hours later and a number of rolls we ordered had still not arrived. the restaurant was only 13rs full on friday evening and it was still slow service. maybe its a technique for saving on allyoucaneat customers, but  itll cost them my business going forward!
the only reason this places is getting 2 stars is b.c the staff was very friendly. however, the food service was horrible. it took us an average of 15 mins to get two rolls. the fish wasnt the greatest and the fish portion were unreasonably small when ordering nigiri. we were cut off b.c of their 1 12 dinner time limit. this upset me the most b.c we were waiting for or food longer than actually eating. i was very disappointed after reading the reviews on yelp, i had very high hopes for this place. not coming back any time soon.
the waitress was friendly but the service was still slow. the only good experiences ive had here were under the previous name when no one else was in the restaurant. not worth coming here when there are other better places in the valley.
i was pretty excited to try out a new campusadjacent pizza place. the other places in the area are good, but this ones location was great. the good: the place is new, so its squeaky clean. the dining area is a bit sparse, but perfectly functional. the pizza flavor isnt bad. that said:the bad: the pizza itself is out of whack. im all about cracker crusts, but you cant dump a pound of oily mozzarella on super thin crusts. im not against a fork  knife pizza, but this one is an unavoidable mess not something you want to deal with on a quick lunch run. the prices are also off. just because your pizza isnt a dominos pizza, that doesnt give you carte blanche to charge twice as much. a 14 pizza for 13 isnt exorbitant, but when that 13 pizza feels cheaper than dominos, it makes you wonder where that money went. the same is true for the mozzarella sticks 6 for four pinkysized sticks? come on. thats as much as half of a 14 pizza! i really want to see the locallyoperated restaurants in this area succeed, but unless this one makes some heavyhanded adjustments, i dont see it surviving the year.
disappointment. the place looks cool so the four of us wandered in at the end of a long day to get our dessert. the menu doesnt really have small desserts at least not for small prices. i got a classic chocolate fondue with dark chocolate  which was really too sweet for what dark chocolate should taste like, but it was the best thing on the table. too bad that there wasnt enough fondue  for all the pieces of fruit, brownie and waffle that came with it. there wasnt a candle to keep it warm so it got cold quickly when you dipped cold fruit into it.  my friends got hot chocolates dark and semi sweet which they say is not impressive and not as good as juliet et chocolate where i would recommend you visit instead. they also shared a triple chocolate cake that was served in an uncomfortable brandy glass with lots of whipped cream, but it didnt look good  nor did they like it  it was left mostly uneaten. another friend had a parfait which he claimed to be like a milkshake and different from what he expected by the menu description and picture. in short  if you want a big sweet mediocre chocolate meal  you can get it here, but dont expect much except for a slight nausea  feeling. across the street, at premier moisson  you will find better desserts for a smaller price. if its a chocolate meal you really want youll do better at juliet et chocolate much better value.  we will not be back.  oh  service was fine  therefore they get two stars.
they served orida fries with there steak! they also told me i was getting wild caught salmon when it clearly was farm raised. not wise to lie to your customers.
meh....blah...basically a disappointment. ive been enjoying the new revival of downtown...e.a.t., carsons kitchen, the perch, etc. this restaurant delivers on the sleek and modern interior but falls considerably short on the rest. the food was ok. out of the 3 shareable items we ordered the mushroom flatbread was the tastiest. its small and made with puff pastry but i liked the egg addition. the oxtail empenadas werent bad but nothing id order again. they were small 2 bite empenadas. the mac and cheese was bland and void of flavor aside from the occasional bite of bacon. the sauce was more of a bechemel with very little cheese flavor at all. the waitress, although pleasant, was borderline car salesmanlike. by that i mean, i felt pressured to order more food. she also blatantly interrupted our conversation to tell us more details about the items we had already ordered while we were waiting for them to be prepared. i also dont appreciate  being given only the option of 2 different bottled waters when i ask for water. i want tap water..yeah i know its appalling, my apologies. the elder melon drink was another letdown. priced at 12 and being given the sales pitch about how its a sangria and made fresh daily on the premises, i guess i expected too much. the drink was small and tasted like a strong alcohol with a watermelon chunk in it. it resembled nothing of any sangria ive tasted before, no sweet fruity flavor. after we were done eating and were presented with our check...it took ages to get someone to take it. i ended up flagging down another waitress and asking her to take it, if i had cash i wouldve just left it on the table.  my final gripe is that there is no happy hour menu. we ate 3 appetizers and had 3 drinks...the bill was 77 and change. sooooo not worth it. for half that price we could have gone to the perch down the street or any other downtown restaurant with happy hour.
went tapas style during a bar and restaurant crawl and decided to partake of the street corn and popcorn at therapy.  the street corn was pretty good, but no one at our table of four could be talked into eating more than a small handful of the badly seasoned popcorn. while the atmosphere inside is nice, the menu is a bit pretentious and unnecessarily expensive for the small portions served. if youre an uppity hipster, youll love it.  otherwise, pick somewhere else.  the two stars are shared for the servers and bus staff, who were the only light in this dimly lit place.
the venue itself is really nice! its hard to believe that it used to be a cheesy souvenir shop before. it has a modern industrial look to it now, plenty of space and really clean. the reason for the 2 star review:1. they had great happy hour specials  i showed up at 11 on a thursday. me and my friends ordered a bunch of four roses whiskeys on the rocks....for 5 bucks! fantastic deal. then the bill comes.....they charged for ice! yes ice! we asked the bartender if the drink listed was part of the happy hour and she confirmed that it was. and somehow we didnt get the 5 dollar price. i looked over the menu after getting the bill and it didnt say anything about a charge for ice. im surprised that they didnt charge of for the use of the cups. just absurd. be aware of extra hidden charges!2. the dj blasts the music!. he plays nothing but club edm, which is fine. however, there isnt a dance floor at all. not a huge deal, but it didnt make sense to me.
food was decent, if i ever go back itll be solely for that. and thats thats a huge if. this place is new, so the first 2 times i went i cut them a lot of slack, lets just say 3rd time was not a charm. if i didnt live downtown i probably would have not even given it chance 2 or 3....staring at an empty glass at the bar seems to be a trend, service all around seems to be lacking....1st time was a complete disaster with wrong food being brought to the tablefood was still good so didnt make a huge issue...just not what we ordered , empty drinks and no table touch from a manager. 2nd time the bartender completely forgot about us at the end of the bar, ordered 2 beers and never saw him again. 3rd time was just blah.....no personality from the bar staff, empty drinks, never checked to see if everything was ok. i hope this place does well and they have potential, maybe im just going in at the wrong times? i want to like this place but they make it pretty hard
the food and the service was wonderful.  however the server said the stuff was all big enough to share. the portions were very small for how expensive it was. we got 5 things for 4 people, and left hungry.
its difficult to leave a review that isnt positive, when you truly want to support the revival of the downtown scene in las vegas. having said that  im pretty disappointed in my experience at therapy. to break it down  we had 4 items  oxtail empanadas, hangar steak tartar, the perfect cure charcuterie board,  the crispy fried pig ears.the perfect cure  charcuterie board  honestly.. pretty bland and really overpriced for what you get. 15 for a small board. i have had larger, better quality meats at highend restaurants on the las vegas strip that were less expensive, they better overall and more in portion.. thats with an inflated las vegas strip price tag as well! oxtail empanadas  these were the favorite for me, but saying that  they were flavorless and not very interesting. i just didnt find anything exciting about the presentation or seasonings. crispy fried pig ears  just boring and flavorless. the texture of the batter was weird and not pleasant.  didnt taste like anything specific.. just blandly gooey and not good. i have experienced pig ears fried very nicely many times and there was just nothing good to report, in my opinion. hangar steak tartar  i got sick. i got very sick, and i think this may have been the culprit. it was boring and not flavorful overall. we actually had to use the grain mustard from the charcuterie board with the tartar to give it some life. i will not go into the details becuase it was pretty bad.. but i have a feeling this was it.2 stars because the service was pleasant.. but i dont see myself going back anytime soon. the menu seems to have no direction that id like to go in : i just dont know what the idea is here.  i had 1 glass of wine, my buddy and i both had sangria, and the bill was about 105. its wasnt anything that i want to experience again, anytime soon. anyway  happy eating!
two points are given for a fabulous looking place. i just dont know about this menu.if therapy means sandwiches and salads, done without flare, then i have the wrong idea of therapy. the menu looks like the starbucks takeaway menu. i think if this place redo their menu, then they could be the best place on the street. still i believe the thai restaurant across the road wins handsdown for now.
very nice decor. good service. way overpriced and tiny portions. feels like youre in europe. our table ordered the squash flathead, ox tail empinadas, and scottish salmon. all were tastey, but it took us like 5 minutes to eat. ironically, the dessert was huge. it makes no sense. entrees that are like a snack and desserts that are too big to finish. i would go back for drinks at the bar, but never again to eat.
eh, wasnt impressed at all.we tried what seemed like every item on the menu and nothing wowd me. i came with a great group of friends, so a great time was had. no one seemed to love anything. no one said this is so great, lets get more, etc. we left and i was hungry, even though we ordered a ton of food. id pass on this place and try something different downtown.
simply put, food and drinks sucked! my bloody mary was so thick i couldnt suck it through the straw. the mixture they use was really thick and the bartender pretty much filled the whole glass with it and nothing else! i kept adding water to it bug it was just gross. the food was just as bad. we got the french dip which was way over cooked and bland. the truffle chips was actually the best thing in the dish. i got the pretzel sticks which was ok and the big sexy: wagyu burger with brie and pickled tomatoes cooked medium. of course my burger didnt come out till after my friend already finished his meal! and the dude next to me who came in 20 min after me finished his meal! over cooked dry and hard patty. bun was also dry....only good was the pickled tomatoes! the burger was so dry it got stuck in my throat and had to wash it down with water cuz my bloody mary was too thick to drink! total waste! giving it 2 stars cuz the bartender was nice and the truffle chips were good. never coming back and not recommending.
the ice machine and the ability to keep the soda machine cold was broken yet they didnt tell me when i purchased a drink. i think that is sneaky. lukewarm soda is gross, especially for someone who doesnt drink soda often. i was hoping for a treat. boo to chipotle.
i was a bit turned off by the fact that many of their dishes were pork. being a nonpork eater, it was a bit tricky trying to find something that was appetizing and porkless. service needs some serious work. they gave my table a couple of  wrong dishes that we did not order and it took awhile for the food to come out.i settled for the deep fried shrimp spring rolls, beef brisket with crepe noodles and shrimp and ped pod dumplings. the spring rolls were good but with them being so greasy, i could not eat more than two. i guess my waistline is thankful for this. beef brisket was extremely fatty. i hardly got any meat. they did however fill the bowl with crepe noodles. meh...i probably wont be returning. this was my first time having dim sum and i have to believe there is much better dim sum to be had. this just is not it...
service needs improvement! waiters did not come to us asking for what to order. we went to the waiter instead. no water provided. good food with soso : service.
how does this place survive?  the service is bad. they are nice people, just lack of process. only 3 out of more that 40 tables were occupied, there were several servers. still i had to walk over to look for help.  the dim sum was good. avoid everything else.
tonight we decided to try nani for the first time. we went on a saturday night around 6 for dinner with a group of 4. we had heard good things about their dim sum and had high hopes. once we sat down we were greeted immediately and our server explained how to order from their menu w pictures. we had to ask to see a cocktail menu and did not get water immediately. actually, we had to ask again for water and were only brought one water and had to ask again for all 4 of us to get a glass of water. we ordered 6 different dim sum entrees with the assumption that we would order more. that ended up not being the case as our food was quite underwhelming. we ordered the shrimp dumplings, pan fried veggie rolls, pepper pork ribs, fried sticky rice, bbq pork buns and the sesame balls. when we tried to order cocktails, we were informed that they did not have any tonight but that we could order from their sake and martini menu. so i ordered a martini with the exact same vodka as the cocktail i initially tried to order ?? the dim sum plates that we enjoyed were the bbq pork buns, the shrimp dumplings and the sesame balls our favorite. unfortunately we did not like the other half of our meal. the fried rice had small pieces of a dried jerky like meat and small fried shrimp. it overall was very fishy tasting and none of us really liked it. the ribs were full of gristle, fat and bones leaving very little edible meat. we agreed that the flavor was good but the meat quality was poor. we also thought that the veggie rolls were greasy and flavorless. lastly, our waiter never came and checked up on us to give us water or ask if we wanted to order more plates. then when we gave up on that we could not even get him to bring the check. all four of us agreed that we would not be back. very disappointing.
it wont be the food that makes this place go out of business. it will be the service. lets start off with the good. the food. probably the best in madison by a good margin. typical dim sum dishes but they are tasty. if youve eaten dim sum in chicago, or texas, or ca, you will still be happy. now the bad. the service. its horrible and if this place ever closes, i wouldnt be surprised if this was the reason. the service is bad. i had to raise my hand multiple times to get attention. i almost wanted to walk into the kitchen to get my own water, and to refill it. i understand it takes for certain dishes, but i dont see an excuse for any dish to come near an hour later from sitting or when you are about to pay. at least a continuous update is acceptable if its taking too long.
i had a taste for pizza one night and looked at the offers for competitors in the area, but they all had deals where you had to take two mediums for 7.99 each when all i really wanted was one pizza. i found this place by word of mouth and went after reading reviews.was the pizza good...eh, it took care of the taste for pizza. it looked like what pizza should taste like. the crust was premade, any number of toppings you could ever want and its all ready in 3 minutes. would i go back? probably not. everything about the place felt sterile as if the concept was cooked up by someone with no imagination for design or a person who thought what would pizza look like if it was invented in the americas by an accountant?. the format is so cookie cutter it removes all of the joys, culture, history of pizza and smells of italian food. this place can be a subway in a hospital, but at least subway smells like bread and food. this place smelled like nothing. the price was great, the service was excellent and the store was clean, but sometimes you can have all that and the food just not deliver. id hate for this trend of restaurants to catch on and dumb down the palate of americans.
ok so lets see. uptown is blowing up right now and im always happy to have another restaurant. im all about pizza so this fit the bill. took my kid in tonight to see how it fares.  overall theres nothing terrible. no horror stories to report. but ironically the pizza place named sauce had very little sauce on it our pizza. the ingredients were good but nothing stood out.the service was ok. friendly but nothing to write home about.  so overall, its ok. with federal pizza close by and closer to me than sauce, i dont see myself coming back. federal beats sauce in every way i can think of. with lou malnatis coming soon across the street, i feel like sauce needs to seriously elevate its game or be relegated to that cheaper pizza place over there status.
usually love sauce and go there often, but my wife and son both got horrible food poisoning from the chicken yesterday. not sure if this is due to the new location, new ownership, or just a fluke. things happen, but they got very sick from this experience.
i love the other greens and protein. i even gave the one on eastern 5 stars for their amazing customer service and food. i went to the new one on rainbow yesterday and it was weird. the server was very nice, but was having difficulty using their new system. even the other person working seemed to find it confusing. it was pretty dead inside which is unusual for a greens and protein, but our food took forever. we didnt even get an acknowledgement or an apology for it taking so long. i believe the other people that were there might have known the owners or managers because kids of theirs were running around and going in and out of the back room. also, a dog was barking. we couldnt tell if it was from the back office or kitchen, but were hoping it wasnt the kitchen. the food was still great, but everything else made me uncomfortable.
when we arrived we were second in line. we ordered a wrap, 2 wellness drinks and a childs pasta. our drinks came out fast but it was over a half hour for our food. the food was ok but they messed up our order, we were charged 1.50 for avocado that they forgot to put in the wrap. overall the food was good but overpriced. their smoothies are 810 and service is slow. the girl who took our order was rude and very short with us. sad to say it this will be my last trip here.
used to be my favorite lunch and healthy spot until i found a staple in my drink! ahh! so upsetting! i used to go 34 times a week but havent been back since the staple incident. i let them know and all they did was make me a new one but i was honestly too afraid to drink it. oh well! they stay busy! the food is pretty good! just cant stomach the staple.
they wrre closing early because of christmas  eve...no problem.  but checker pauly c. rude because i didnt know they only took cash or debit cards. not impressed with staff of store..will not shop there any longer and will advise other family members  and friends  to shop elsewhere  as well.  never had a rude employee  like that at any store.
i used to love this place, however, the last 2 visits have been a huge let down. when things go as they should, the drinks are delicious! my last 2 visits though have been a disappointment. last week, they ran out of most of their ingredients they use to make the drinks. some of which were the green tea, coffee, and the worst part, the boba! out of the 3 of us in my party, only my daughter was able to get a drink, since they still had all the ingredients to make hers. a few days ago, i gave it another shot. i asked for extra boba in my matchacha, which is an up charge that im normally ok with but it didnt seem like there were any extra added. this isnt the first time i felt like they didnt add my extra boba which i paid for, but this definitely verified that i wasnt just going crazy the last few times it happened. theyve also made drinks incorrectly for us in the past, which they are very reluctant to remake, and in some instances the remade ones still dont come out right: i really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately, i wont be back. there are other boba places in the valley that have more consistent quality.
i was on my way out of town but had a bit of time to kill in that area... i saw the good reviews and that they had wifi and decided to swing by.  turned out, they dont offer public wifi.  the drink cup was hard to hold with one hand while i had to drag a luggage.. and the drink was too sweet and pretty pricey.  i shouldve gone to another place to kill time....
as soon as we walked in , we felt the great atmosphere. they were very nive to my friends and i. there was a mariachi band that played some great songs for us . i give it two stars because of the food. the beans were horrible . they tasted like can beans . the sopa de fideo had no flavor , couldnt made it better my self. i asked for alot of onions and limons to give all the food flavor. the drinks are delicious bit food is terrible. fell bad saying because they were really friendly but i have to be honest. its to expensive for the quality. i think all the comments are misleading .
we tried las tarascas again on sunday july 19 and while the service through out the meal was great we were not impressed by the food as we had been by the appetizers we tried the week before.  we started with the complimentary bean dip  salsa  a small plate of chiles toreados.  the bean dip was very runny like a thick soup with no flavor and the salsa was a roasted thin salsa with a smokey flavor of which we were not fans of.  we asked for the hot salsa which we liked much better.the roasted chiles and red onions were a hit as we like the sweetness of the red onion with the hot spicy chiles.  the soup soon came and it was as good as our first visit, lots of fideo and flavor, of course we added a little lime to it for more flavor. we had the chilaquiles verdes, 2 item combo  beef burrito plate.  i had my chilaquiles with 2 eggs over easy and it came out with hard cooked eggs and they took it back to get me the eggs over easy.  it came back perfect the second time but the chilaquiles were very wet and runny.  i took some chips from the table to soak up the sauce and also give it the little crunch i like in the dish.  the green salsa did not have much flavor  the rice and beans were terrible, the rice had no flavor and we all 3 would swear that the beans came from a can. ignacio had the 2 item combo which was a tacos dorados and the chile relleno.  he was not happy as none of his food had any real flavor.  the relleno was just a piece of greasy white cheese inside a flat lifeless chile with a red sauce on top.  ignacio did not touch the beans or rice. he was very dissapointed.  uriel had a beef burrito.  while he said the beef was good and it was loaded with beef he wondered how they called it a burrito as it looked more like an rolled taco as you can see in the pic.  the ends were open and he also did not touch the beans or rice.overall we just were not impressed with the food here especially when you take into consideration the prices.  the prices may be in line with some other mexican restaurants but the quality of the food needs great improvement if this place is going to survive. the food needs to have some flavor and everything needs to be freshly made.  this is a tough location that has seen 5 restaurants come and go in the 6 years we have lived in this area.  the last mexican restaurant only lasted 4 months.there is a ton of mexican restaurants in this town and a few good ones in this area but if las tarascas is going to make it, it needs to improve one the quality of food it is dishing out.the three amigos
i am sure they came to town with the highest expectations but i dont think they will last here.  the store is very nice but i feel, and so do many of my neighbors, that they have priced themselves out of our marketplace.  being in the middle of a retirement community has its drawbacks.  some of us are living on our retirement income and are not willing or able to pay for upscale think whole foods prices.  i see that they are striving for higher quality but until the prices are lowered on a regular basis, i cannot afford to shop there.  the store appears to be mostly empty when i have stopped in because of convenience for one or two items.
i wish that id had the great experience that other reviewers had. no watermelon mimosas, which was a reason we chose this place. ordered a regular mimosa, nearly all juice and not much bigger than a shot glass. 11:30 on a sunday, out of gravy, so no biscuits and gravy.  quinoa just wasnt coming out so i settled for a waffle. friend ordered a breakfast sandwich and ended up with a burger sandwich bunmade of tater tots.  she was hungry and after settling for this because of the lack of gravy, so she bit her lip and just kept it. our server, brian, was good, so theres that. not sure i can muster the patience to give them a second chance.
i so wanted to like this place because its close to my house but i unfortunately dont think i will be back. maybe the big draw of this place is the bloody mary bar, but i went for the food and was pretty disappointed. i woke up craving a biscuit, punched biscuit into yelp and thought i would try something new and check out this place. i ordered the eggs benedict which consists of a biscuit, hollandaise, ham, and poached eggs of course. it comes with a side of hash. the hollandaise was good and the egg was cooked perfectly, unfortunately, that was not enough to earn a good review. the hash had no crisp or crunch, it was all soft potatoes, and it came with bell peppers, which is not indicated on the menu anywhere. i have a bell pepper allergy, so automatically, i could not eat more than a few bites of my hash. im not going to dock points for that, because to be fair, i could have asked. however, i dont really know anywhere else where bell pepper is a standard hash ingredient. if you call yourself the hash kitchen, you should have an out of this world hash with texture and bold flavor. then, the biscuit was sweet and dense. i had been expecting something fluffy and savory, but it was really more like a scone which was kind of strange with all of the lovely savory flavors of the benedict. to be honest, i felt like mcdonalds does a better biscuit, and thats a little sad. the service was excellent and the location was adorable, but i cant justify spending the money on really subpar food. i shouldnt be left wishing i had gone to a fast food joint instead. its a new place, so hopefully some changes will be made. i think they could really benefit from changing their flavor profiles up a bit, many of the menu items were basically the same thing with just one small difference. also on saturday and sunday they have a dj starting at 10 am. maybe they didnt realize they were in a residential area, not the old town bar scene?  i think the restaurant just missed the mark all around, which is too bad, that complex would really benefit from a delicious breakfast spot.
loved the ambiance of this place. classy and comfortable. unfortunately, wasnt impressed with the food. our table started with the donut and nutella appetizer which looked amazing and our friends said it was delicious. but my main course of the gluten free pancakes was unimpressive. over cooked on the bottom and really hard. i had to dip them in my coffee to soften them. no bueno. in addition, my white scramble was only ok. nothing special and kinda bland. for a 20 meal, was hoping for better. the staff was friendly and the atmosphere is 5 star, too bad the food isnt up to snuff. havent found a place yet to compete with butters down the street for eggs and gf pancakes at a great price.
maybe everyone that wrote a five star review had a great experience, or maybe they just buy into the pretentious scottsdale bs that this place has down to a science. i get that they took a highend restaurant and turned it into a brunch spot but honestly the decor prices dj the whole scene was totally overthetop and they seem much more concerned about appearances then actual quality of service and food.whats right: great diverse menu  great drinks awesome bloody mary bar cleanwhats wrong: overpriced we each had one drink and an entree and the bill was 90 for 4 people. for breakfast awful staff  the manager is a total ass. i saw him yell at staff in a completely derogatory and condescending manner multiple times. he did literally nothing except try to look important when clearly his staff needs coaching on service. and the hostess had on booty jorts and a 2.99 tank top from forever 21. not knocking that outfit in general but it seems kind of tacky considering the image theyre trying to portray. plus the gross manager was all brushing up on her. no specials  not everyplace has to have unlimited mimosas but some sort of deal would be nice, like 2 for ten or something  the freakin hash!  im going to go out on a limb here but if youre going to put the word hash into the name of your business your hash should probably be pretty decent right? i ordered a hash with fresh lump crab on it and was pretty excited to try it. unfortunately the sweet potatoes in the hash were completely undercooked and disgusting. so i sent back the hash and it came back out with cooked yet flavorless potatoes but now there is no egg on it. so by the time i got my food everyone was done eating and finally i got my complete meal about 40 minutes after i ordered. my sister ordered another hash with regular potatoes and was equally unimpressed. you just need to do something special if youre going to base your menu around something.and the cardinal sin of all breakfast places as well as number one indicator a breakfast place will go out of business..... drumroll please... they did not keep our coffee cups full. each of us had coffee and it was only refilled one time and that was after sitting empty for at least 10 minutes. the server brought the check and never asked if we wanted more but we did so we asked for more which turned out to be a good idea because we waited about another 15 minutes for our credit card to be run. i give points for the menus creativity but the execution is bad and the service worse. i give this place 2 stars and 6 months!
i was really wanting this place to be fantastic...but it wasnt. to start, we had to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated because they dont usually have seating for 6 people. apparently they only cater to parties of 4 or less. once seated it took another ten minutes for a waitress to come over and take drink orders. then another 15 minutes to come over for our breakfast order. then at least another 35 minutes to get our food. the restaurant was only 12 full. once our food arrived, water glasses were not regularly filled, no one asked if we wanted another overpriced mimosa, or a coffee refill. after asking what happened to our food, a manager buzzed by asking if everything was okay, but not in a way that seemed to indicate he actually cared what our answer might be. the food was okay. highlights were the chicken and waffle, and the yogurt parfait. the almond and coconut covered frenzy ch toast was tasty but came with some nasty bananas. the belgian waffles were pretuty heavy. the corn beef hash was not worth going back for. the sides of hash browns not that thrilling, either. so, they did a nice job renovating the place but it will not be there that long with such uneven service and fairly mediocre food. the bloody mary bar looked pretty great, but i dont think a restaraunt can really depend on that to keep the customers coming back.
three of us had breakfast this morning and were disappointed at best.  service was slow and unorganized.  when we asked server about the differences between the online menu and the copy given to us, he informed us that online menus were enhanced. friend 1 had a waffle which came plain, uncrisp,  and without any garnishes.  friend 2 had the veggie scramble.  all three of us commented that it looked dirty.  i had the brisket with cornbread hash.  the poached eggs were too well done, the cornbread hash was dry and too sweet.  while the two strips of brisket were acceptable, they were added on top of the skillet making them look like an afterthought.  bottom line...service and presentation receive fs all around.  the one good feature was the floor was carpeted so the noise level was very tolerable.
ive read many great reviews....so was excited to try it today.  the bloody mary bar is awesome and a fun experience.  unfortunately, i cannot say the same for the food.  we ordered the smoked brisket breakfast and the corned beef hash.  both were bland with no flavoring.  no salt, pepper or herbspice on either.  even the fresh baked biscuit was bland. the corn bread hash was uninspired and mushy.   very sorry to say but we were very disappointed.
i really want this place to be great. my third time here and orders were not delivered accurately all three visits . waiters seem overworked but definitely trying hard to keep up with an unreasonable number of tables to cover. wait for food was too long every visit. the food is fine, but the atmosphere is confusing and awkward. management has fixes to make fast or this place will fail
we try to do a new place with our nonmeating friends every so often. they had tried this place before and invited us to join them. its in the old cuttlefish building in north scottsdale. decor is modern farm to table...trendy. the menu is severely meat friendly. but there are some shrimp and salmon options, as well as the waffles and pancakes. and the every ubiquitous bacon bandwagon. the coffee was strong and very tasty. but my cup was left empty several times and i actually had to get up and get it myself 2 times. which is odd because when we needed service, it wasnt there, however, when we were still eating, bus boys kept trying to take our plates away...without asking. we had to verbally stop them 3 times total no, im not finished eating yet!. same with the water glasses, always empty. i ordered the artichoke fritata. very dry and flavorless and came to the table not hot, not warm, but kind of on the room temperature side. i rarely put salt on any food i order, so when i have to salt my food, i feel like theres no inherent flavor to enjoy. and several of the artichoke bites were the chewy stem parts so i had a little side pile of artichoke chew and spit outs. felt rushed with sub par food.

super cute location. service was great. got in the car with my yogurt without testing first and yikes!! the chocolate is seriously yucky with some sort of lime tart no i didnt get any tart flavors and the salted caramel is way too salty. im bummed bc i have never had a problem with the mesa location. there goes 4 down the drain...literally bc i took 2 bites!
i gave it 2 stars because ive been there before and enjoyed it....however, today was the pits!  we called in at 9:00 in the morning...first they didnt answer, then when we called back....they put us on hold set the phone on the counter so we could hear everything happening and after 10 minutes yes, 10 minutes we decided they forgot us and we hung up.  called back after 5 minutes and i guess the phone was still off the hook as they never picked up.  finally got through and the guy said he was too busy, he had 30 golfers there that just checked in that had never been there before and he had to take care of them and to call back in a half hour. he said he was there working alone because 2 people called in sick and couldnt help us right then.  wow....really???   what happed to customer service....this was customer no service!  very disappointed....today!  like i said, we have golfed there before and enjoyed it but today was the worst service no service weve ever received from a golf course!!
really disappointing evening. we were excited for star wars trivia and have been meaning to try this place for awhile. the poutine is okay, i ordered the burger and had to send it back because it was so dry, so they compd it and i got the beet salad. it was pleasant.  they were hosting a christmas party the same night so it was loud and not a nice environment at all. trivia was poorly done. bill came and the charges were wrong. we will not be back.
ordered a combo burger which comes with a regular drink. the drink they provided was small or maybe even extra small. after asking the staff they said that that is their regular size. whatever. i feel ripped off and will never return to these guys. you have been warned .....
i ordered:5 fill up: twopiece drumstick  thightwo pieces of fried chicken, larger mashed potatoes, biscuit, medium drink and a chocolate chip cookie for just 5 plus taxi received:1 chicken breastregular mac and cheesebiscuit medium drinkchocolate chip cookieit would be a 3 star review if they got the order right.
i cant comment on the food so i wont give too low of a rating. but this place wasnt comfortable upon walking in. we walked all the way from the front to the sushi bar and no one really looked at us until we walked out. the restaurant is clean but thats not a surprise for a brand new spot. the most prominent thing in the restaurant is a chalk board that runs along the entire right wall and is covered with all you can eat rules or all you cannot eat rules:no sharingno sashimino customized rollsno a la carte then switching to aycei dont eat shellfish and my wife cant eat avocado. this sounds like a very limiting situation for us. we eat tons of sushi, so its not normally an issue. i wont list other sushi places on this review, as thats pretty mean. but it doesnt cost much for a restaurant  to accommodate a guest, especially if its not busy. note to owner:  i understand that youre running a business, but its a hospitality business. before you worry about your money, i recommend making your guests feel welcomed. i strongly urge you to erase the chalk board on the wall and put up a pretty picture of something that makes your guests feel happy. put the rules on the menu and people will understand.
great sushi. and really open, fresh atmosphere. however, i wont be returning. the ownerchef came to our table about four times, interrupting our conversations. it was fine the first time but after that, it was distracting. also, ive eaten at several all you can eat sushi places and theyve all been really chill if you have a few pieces of a roll left over. not this place. we were told wed have to pay if we didnt finish. mind you, we only had about 6 pieces left. so my friends had to help me finish to avoid paying. another thing: my friend and i ordered the same appetizer and the waitress asked me if i wanted to share with my friend and i told her no, i wanted my own. maybe im sensitive but that bothered me. and she also kept forgetting to bring out some items we ordered, so we had to ask for them again. overall its a good place but ive been to other sushi restaurants and had a better experience.
beware!!! had high hopes for this place. ordered a couple rolls. my wife took her first bite of her roll, looked down and saw a cockroach crawl from underneath her plate. they offered to make us a new roll. we agreed, they brought out the same partially eaten roll, no lie. and gave us two tiny little pieces of sushi to compensate. the owner was apologetic but did not offer a comped meal and ultimately charged us full price for roach infested dinning experience. 808 sushi tapas was the place before this one and kills there sushi. we will not be back to this place...
they served us warm oysters.....that alone should tell the entire story, but if you want to know more, the quality of the fish is only average.  they give you really tiny pieces which makes you think that its ok because then you get to try more, but then you suddenly realize, youre practically just eating rice because the fish is cut so thin and small you aint eating jack shit.
honestly, some of the rolls are ok. the salmon cheese stick was pretty good...but they just use cream cheese instead of a different cheese. the service isnt that good. the beef in the bbq roll was disgusting...it literally was all fat. i took out the meat and didnt eat it. the green tea  cheesecake was frozen....ive never had cheesecake that was frozen. :i would not recommend it. i would recommend oyshi. im not coming back here.
lets be honest, everyone in this town is a sushi expert.there are just a couple of rules you are going to have to follow if you want to roll out a new ayce sushi bar in las vegas:1  keep your prices competitive 3 more than everywhere else? why?2  keep your fish fresh if you cant sell it before it starts to turn, dont try to pass it on to unsuspecting customers3  don;t be cheap buy sushi quality fish  believe me, we can tell the difference3  offer what everyone else does if you wont serve me sashimi with ayce, why should i come here?4  dont skimp on portions look, stop being cheap, your fish is going rank, use it before it goesi will say it not the worst place i have tried in vegas, but if i am paying piece meal instead of going ayce, i expect you not to give my tiny little sliver of fish.ill be honest, the salmon tasted like crap. sushi grade salmon doesnt taste like the cheap, color added, farmed raised crap you buy at vons.we are all sushi experts in this town  if you want to succeed, respect that.
if youre a fan of slightly broken furniture that may or may not be missing a critical piece, then this is the place for you. the best deals are in holiday decor and pool furniture. there are some hidden gems there in those categories. the rest of the inventory is pretty junky. worth poking your head in if your already at the pavilions, but wouldnt make a special trip for this which we did, oops.
overpriced, beatup merchandise.  no bargains here.  a waste of time.
one of the irritating inevitabilities about living in the valley is eventually being unable to escape some douchebag who migrated here from any other metropolitan area, and drones on incessantly about how much better things are back home.chicagoans might very well be the worst.enter portillos.know somebody from chicago? who doesnt? theyre everywhere. like cockroaches. ask them about portillos, and youll never get them to shut up. dis is da gratess hot dug effer. you kaint git hot dugs like dis in feenix. id keel yoo for a portilloson and on.its a hot dog guys, nothing more, nothing less. youd do just as well from a cart guy on a downtown street corner.we arrived at the new tempe location and parking situation was a clusterfkzoo, which i cant see getting any better any time soon. portillos did have staff poised in the lot to assist, but they seemed just as confused as most of the drivers.inside? holy crap. cavernous and full. very busy, very loud and very colorful. portillos has a standard walk up counter for ordering, but today we were greeted by order takers who would then hand back our written orders to give to the people behind the counter. after paying, you are given a number and guided to the other end of the restaurant to wait at an order up counter. btw, the lady working the mike and calling order numbers was extremely irritating, sounding like a carnival barker and, for some reason, feeling it was necessary to add a rhyming quip to every number called.i think this portillos was purposely overstaffed because it was grandopening week, and they were still working out the kinks.one kink in serious need of a work out was delivery and presentation. we ordered 2 jumbo chili dogs, 1 large cheese fry and a large root beer. we waited 20 minutes and what we got was a soggy lukewarm mess. we were confused as to why were asked for here, or to go when we ordered, as, even though we clearly stated we were dining in, we were handed a paper sack of food and a drink to go.chili dogs dont wrap in paper very well. so what we unwrapped was a couple of smashed, room temperature messes with half the chili sticking to the paper wrapping. the dog was only ok, the chili generic, and they were a little too generous with the onions, but like i said before, hey its just a hot dog. in this instance, a hot dog with absolutely nothing special going on. the cheese fries were hot and tasty with the cheese served on the side again, in a to go cup. not nearly enough cheese to satisfy the large order of spuds though, and i later noticed it was the same sized cup of cheese that came with the small order of fries too.i would discount this place as just another not worth it franchise of the backhomers, and the parking situation really does need a fix. but just as we were finishing up, i spied a rather frail elderly lady hoisting a italian beef, and man, did she look happy. happy enough, in fact, to make me want to go back to portillos and give it another shot, this time with the italian beef.however, if youre just looking for a hot dog to throw down for lunch, see the guy on the street corner and avoid the portillos hassle.after all, its just a hot dog.update alert!!!92113ok....went back and tried that italian beef i referred to earlier. nope. nothing special. not bad, not great. there are a lot of chicago joints in the valley. so far, none can hold a candle to lukes italian beef.just as many employees as the first time, but, even though portillos was much less crowded than the first time i went is the luster really wearing off that fast?, the employees seemed even less organizedonce again, our food took a little too long to come, and was, once again packed to go even though we specifically, once again, said we were dining in.overall, after 2 trips to portillos, nothing special or worth the crowd, wait time, or parking hassle.
i hate having to leave this review because the portillos in scottsdale blew me away when i first heard of this chain. my 1st visit to this portillos in tempe, was this past weekend. i was super excited for i was traveling from qc to scottsdale and new this location had just opened and i had to pass it to get to my friends house! why not try it out since the other location is out of the way and far from me! i was soooo super excited i think i may have exceeded the speed limit to get there! lol! the drive through was pretty thorough and awesome when i arrived. you had very nice but crazy people, because they are standing outside all day in this heat taking your order. i ordered my norm, chili cheese hot dog and chili chesses fries. my ordered was confirmed by at least 3 different people walking down the drive through taking orders and by the person who collects payment; they were all very nice and quick. i pulled up to the last person who brought me my order even repeated my exact order back to me, super happy my order came out before the 2 cars ahead of me how nice and fast left the drive through and rushed to my friends to devour my delicious food. when i got home and opened up my bad of deliciousness i was completely disappointed!!! immediate sad face! i received the wrong order! you know the feeling you get when your parents tell you youre going to disneyland and they end up taking you to the doctor instead? it felt like that, the build up of awesomeness, then the tremendous sadness in the end! i was so sad and frustrated, for you are looking forward in enjoying a delicious meal and you receive an order you dont even want. i received a regular hot dog with mustard.... it would have been fine and i wouldnt be upset if i liked mustard, if i liked mustard a tiny bit, but i completely cant stand the taste of mustard, i hate it. i tried scraping the mustard off the hot dog and throwing the bun away, but it still had its mustard taste, so i tossed it! my chili cheese fries ended up being normal fries, so i ate those and pouted! i know things happen in the drive through ever now and then, it was just frustrating for my order was repeated to me so many times, there was no way i felt i even needed to check it before i left the drive through. then getting all the way home to eat it and it not being the right order is just frustrating. its a waste of money and then a waste of gas to drive back to get my correct order. i will try to give tempe another chance if i am in the area and checking my order every time will be a must now! you wont find me driving out of my way to try it again though :
every time i go to chicago, i try to hit portillos at least once. i was so happy they opened some here. our first visit to the n. scottsdale store was soso. the staff was good and the food as expected, but not impressive. the tempe store just opened a few weeks ago so my son and i decided to go. we should have gone to smash burger around the corner. first, the place is on the ne corner of mcclintock and rio salado. it is not really attached to tempe marketplace unless you park by the imports store and walk through the breezeway to the restaurant. if you go, do this, because the parking lot is a total disaster. the lanes are too narrow for two cars to pass each other, so when not if somebody ignores the arrows and goes the wrong way, everything gridlocks. if you drive a pickup, dont park there, as it takes a 50 point turn to back out of the narrow spaces. after parking my truck in a spot more sized for for a smart, we walked all the way around the drive thru which should have been on the other side of the store and through the patio with too many tables to the line at the cash register. they have two lines, and a nice big easy to read menu on the wall. the problem is, there is a lady standing there that hands you a menu in size 4 font and expects you to figure out what you want before going to the register and while she is suggesting stuff to eat. i was told  please step aside while you make your selection, as the lines grow pretty fast. i dont want you to feel rushed. really. at that point i felt rushed, told her so, and after looking behind me to see nobody in line but us, i walked up to the register, ordered something quickly without looking at the whole menu, and then stood in the throng of people at the pickup counter waiting for their numbers to be called, because you can not hear them in the dining room area. i guess they dont want you to get a table until your hands are full of trays of food. i can understand not taking a table while your family waits in line, but once you order, its fair game. the chicago dog was bangon perfect, the burger, was sort of bland. ill go back, but only for lunch, and not for a dog or a burger, teds hotdogs beats portillos, and smashburger and burger rehab are the only place to go for a burger in this town. if youre gonna enter a new market, be sure you bring what makes you good at home.
i was so so so excited to try this place.  i was even more excited after it opened and i drove over.  the ambiance is adorable and they have outdoor eating.  ordered a hot dog, cheese fries and a chocolate cake shake.  the hot dog was fine, i think costco sells a way better one.  the fries were just okay also, del taco blows them away.... the cheese is served in a little cup on the side and that wasnt to great either.  the chocolate cake shake was actually kinda icky.  there was so much cake it was dry and you couldnt drink it through the straw provided.  i actually took it back and asked to try the strawberry instead.  also not impressed.  i will not be back.
chicago must be seriously lacking good food. that can be the only reason why those from back east are raving about this new joint. weve been twice and both experiences have been completely mediocre.  as a hot dog fan, these lack everything you would expect. not moist, no snap in the bite. the polish had zero spice. if you must have a hot dog, teds hot dogs just down the road to the south is a better choice. i really dont get the hype here?
the plan the other saturday night was to go get burgers from in  out and bring them back to the house.  however, due to events taking place around asu that night and the next day asu homecoming and some race the next day, i was unable to get off on scottsdale road.  and all of the surrounding streets were closed too.  big cluster f.  after sitting in traffic for almost an hour trying to get back to the 202, i get back to haydenmcclintock road.  i see the new portillos and give j a quick call to see if that was an okay substitute for him, to which it was. they have a drivethru which is nice and if it is during a peak time, they have people standing outside waiting to take your order instead of ordering at the squakbox like inout.  if youve never been though, you feel pressed to make a quick meal decision  which i was for mine and  cs meals as j had checked out their menu online and texted me his order.  i ordered 2 chili cheese dogs, a regular hot dog, the poppyseed fruit with chicken salad, and an order of fries.  i found it odd that they do not have kids meals at portillos.  i will say that c liked the hot dog.  but to be honest, i could just buy a package of nathans famous and make these dogs at home chili and chicago.  j felt the same way about his chili dogs which ended up falling apart.  and the fries, i could order the same fries at del taco for the same price.  or better yet, make them at home.  the salad i ordered sounded similar to the strawberry poppyseed seasonal summer only salad i fell in love with at paradise.  boy was i wrong.  the chicken resembled flash frozen chicken.  you know the kind you can get in the freezer section, you just reheat it and use as you like.  terrible.  the only positive thing about the salad was the cheese which there was only a sprinkle of and fruit, which i ended up sharing with c.   the glazed walnuts, there were maybe 4 or 5 pieces in my salad.  oh..they gave you a lemon poppy muffin with the salad.  big whoop.  for the price we paid 20, we were all in all disappointed in our dinner and probably wont be returning.
i wasnt impressed with this place  maybe its because there was so much hype about it before i went. the drive thru is strange  someone in a hat walks next to your car taking your order, but there is no menu board so you have to ask for a menu while a supervisor yells at them to walk more. then there is the food. the sausage and peppers was so dry and totally overwhelmed by the bread. maybe i will give it another try when they have been opened longer.
portillos in chicago is a must. portillos in arizona, meh. scottsdale location better than tempe location, and i only say this because you can taste that lovely tempe wastetap water taste in the food.
crowded and overpriced imho. first time trying the place and always see it crowded so thought id try too. crowded but they were efficient. moved through line quickly. i dont know if it was because of the noise, but my order was wrong. chili cheese dog with onions sounds like nothing else on the menu. chili. cheese. dog. anyway, they write your order on a bag in their own shorthand so it was not possible to know if she wrote it wrong or not. either way, sucked to get a whatever dog with all kinds of stuff to pick off. dog was just ok and i would have said 3 stars if my order had been correct. i should have looked at the receipt i suppose, before assuming. average at best. might be back to try the italian beef.also the fries tasted like high school food.
ive now been twice.  ive had the italian beef and the chili dog both of which i was under the assumption were specialties of the place.  i was....underwhelmed.  the italian beef was pretty plan and they charge extra to add anything to it like cheese.  the hot dog was somewhat small and left me wanting more.  on the positive side the fries are pretty good.  overall, i was underwhelmed, especially after all the hype.  having experienced portillos i can say im glad i tried it but i dont think ill be back.
this place was just...okay.  not terrible but nothing spectacular either. the decore and atmosphere was really great! you can tell they put alot of money and work into the place. the staff was very helpful and friendly. the food, however, was kind of blah. we did get our meals to go and ate it back in the office, so maybe it was because it wasnt piping hot that it didnt taste so good...? but i doubt it. my two other coworkers messaged me that they also didnt care for it. my onion rings were over cooked and were mostly breading, and my chargrilled chicken sandwich was breaded which i wasnt expecting. all in all this place was decent enough but id rather go elsewhere.
this was average at best. i frequented the chicagoland locations years ago and always had an amazing experience. this one, not so much. the portillos dog was not impressive. a small dog with a cheap bun and a failed attempt with the weak fixings. thats just mine.my wifes apple walnut chicken salad was bland, no taste whatsoever and overpriced. that is all to say about that.my son said his burger was good, but his chocolate shake was not. i tried it and it did taste like it was made with generic hersheys syrup.not planning a return visit anytime soon.if your visit was a better experience, congratulations.
again trying to get a good italian beef sandwich. portillos comes with chicago creds. unfortunately their italian beef sandwich skimps on the beef, dry even though i asked for it wet and flavorless. sad this towns only good sandwich was als beef and they closed. i do not recommend this restaurant.  thanks for reading. the bike chaplain
after hearing every chicagoite i know praise this place i knew i had to try it.  i went there on opening day in north scottsdale.  had their italian beef sandwich.  was meh.  went a second time a couple weeks later.  had the italian beef  cheese crossaint. meh again.  figured i would give it one more shot at the tempe location.  had the chicken croissant sandwich.  meh yet again.i know what yall are thinking.  why didnt you have the hot dog?  thats what they do best!  a chicago style hot dog has 2 main things which i cant stand.  mustard and pickles.  you wont get a fair review from me when it comes to hot dogs.  i prefer the majesty of short leash hot dogs.
as the chicago area hot dog critic one thing ive noticed is that when traveling to other metropolitan areas hot dogs arent nearly as popular other places as they are in chicagoland. i did a search for hot dog stands near where im staying during my trip to the phoenix arizona area and found a place called teds hot dogs and the next closest place was immediately familiar. it was portillos, a very popular and abundant chain started in suburban chicago that has apparently made its way to arizona.i finally had a chance to stop by and the first thing that i noticed is that its every bit as busy as the chicagoland locations. the parking lot was completely packed and there was very little available seating inside. there were also tables outside, but people had birds coming up to their tables,sometimes managing to get away with a french fry before fluttering off.  now, ive been to the chicago area portillos many times and have reviewed a few locations. as a child i met dick portillo on a number of occasions and used to be a very big fan of portillos as a chain. over the years, the quality control at portillos has diminished. the same quality ingredients are being used, but it seems like the training on how to properly assemble hot dogs, burgers, and everything else has suffered. or management has simply stopped paying as vigorous attention to quality control. with a location over a thousand miles from chicagoland i wondered if the menu would be different, if the way things were made would be different, and if being so far away the same degradation in food preparation that has infected the chicagoland locations was present here.upon walking in and looking around it sure looked and felt like a portillos. i didnt thoroughly inspect the menu as my order was taken while in line by a lady who wrote it down on the back of a bag, it appeared to be the same as the chicago locations. i placed my order, and then got into the pickup line to wait for my food. one trend ive noticed at the chicago locations is repeated rhymes based on your order number. so they would call out things like number two, your order is due, number three come see me. i noticed with certain numbers they were doing the rhyming as well this must be something they train on, but it wasnt the constant irritation of hearing it at the chicagoland locatons to the point where youre trapped in a dr. seuss book.finally my food was ready and i struggled to find an open seat without subjecting myself to eating outside where birds interrupting my meal was nearly a certainty. i finally sat down took my food out and snapped a picture. this was a regular portillos hot dog. the problem is we had the same inconsistent preparation we see at the chicago area locations.for any of those reading this review that are unfamiliar with what a chicago style hot dog should be, ill go over the basics. a chicago style hot dog has a few different variations. the version served by portillos is the most traditional style which is an allbeef natural casing sausage. the natural casing is skin that when properly heated will give the frankfurter a nice bit of resistance and a snap when you bite into it. the classic chicago style hot dog comes on a poppy seed bun which has been steamed to become soft and easy to bite into. it has a pickle spear or slice, tomato slice, sport peppers, bright green relish mustard, onion and celery salt on it. ketchup is considered to be the worst possible addition to a chicagostyle hot dog as the sweetness overpowers the flavor of the other ingredients.so how did the portillos of tempe hot dog fare? the sausage itself was fine, but the relish application was a bit excessive. this added to the biggest problem,  the bun was steamed  too much along with being causing it to become a tad soggy. as a result the back half of the hot dog dissolved as i picked it up forcing me to struggle to finish the rest without getting my hands wet and sticky. the taste of the hot dog was roughly on par with other portillos, the big problem being a bit too thick of a pickle spear. i also got fries with cheese sauce. these fries were a litle over cooked, id say they were crispy but a few were so crisp there was no potato paste to be extracted from the inside. my overall impression is that this isnt any worse than the chicago area portillos on any given day. but portillos food quality isnt what it used to be either. i did notice quite a few people at this portillos with chicago themed shirts, bears and bulls jerseys. while im sure chicago transplants and visitors only make up a small fraction of their clientele, it struck me as interesting. this is especially true since there doesnt seem to be a lot of other chicago themed eateries around the area. overall, im going to give my portillos experience here two stars. but for the phoenix area readers your mileage may vary as its unique to the area.
used to love going to this place until i ordered a beef dipped with hot.. got home .. took a bite and had a long piece of hair... at this point i was already at home and called a manager there. they agreed to give me a new sandwich but at this point i lost my appetite. please focus on the quality , not quantity !!!!!
seriously let down by this place...i ordered two chicago dogs and they were pretty lackluster. the buns themselves were soggy, the peppers were huge and awkward to eat. the fries were decent and the shake was ok strawberry. sadly this place is supposed to be known for their hotdogs, and they fell pretty flat here. i wont be coming back to this place anytime soon...
way over rated.  i had the beef n cheddar croissant and a chocolate cake shake. my croissant was a gooey soggy mess and the meat didnt have much flavor. my beef n cheddar seemed to be lacking cheddar as well!! like nonexistent. the chocolate cake shake was not really anything id brag about. it was edible but after half,  i tossed it. wont be back.
two and a half stars. very overrated imo. the food would best be described as bland and greasy.  i was really excited when this place opened up but ive been twice now and it has been disappointing both times. too bad.
i dont get it. its a lame hotdog in a soggy bun with annoying seeds. it also had neon green relish that had next to no flavor. i ate it because i was hungry and on the way to the bar. but otherwise i would never come back. we also ordered fries which look like the frozen oreida kind you get in the super market and make at home. they even have the nerve to charge you for ranch dressing for the french fries! nuts! not returning.
gross and flavorless. ive had good italian beef sandwiches before in chicago and new york. this greasy mess isnt anything i would come back for.
bizarre! this place is layed out horribly. its confusing when you walk in because you dont know where to order. now theyve got neon signs but they are lost amid all the vintage signage. they should have a separate door for catering. they dont. if you order a salad, you must pick up your fries and drink separately! makes zero sense. plus the place is freezing. theres food on the floor. theres coworkers walking around, cleaning very sloooowly. they dont look thrilled to be there and neither was i. oh, and its noisy. i recommend eating outside where you can hear yourself. the mediterranean salad is decent but im not dying to return just for that. i can get my greek fix anywhere.
whats the big friggin deal about portillos? stopped by for lunch after picking up my sisters birthday gift at tempe marketplace hoping to find out, especially with many of my friends singing its praises.blech, thats what.soggy bun, tasteless relish, meh hot dog.also split a dipped italian beef with dude, and it was like chewing on grease. no, and not just because it was ordered dipped. ive had better at another local eatery ran by a native chicagoan.freezeraisle esque crinkle cut fries. charging for prepackaged ranch as andrea s. already mentioned. this type of food by its nature isnt the most wholesome, but it left me nauseous as all get out for the rest of the day. not a big hot dog fan to begin with, so maybe im not the most reliable reviewer ... but theres definitely better dogs to be found in the phoenix area. perhaps this was an off day for portillos; however, not sure if ill be back for a round two.
since we were out and about in tempe market place,  meg and i decided to try portillos. wed heard quite a bit about the place and figured wed give it a try. in hindsight, we probably should have just kept driving home.to start, i tried one of the chili hot dogs and fries. the dog was definitely as advertised; tasted exactly like a vienna sausages you get out of the canned foods aisle. and the chili tasted like they took a few steps down the same aisle to grab a can of hormel. and to complete the shopping experience they took a stroll over to the freezer aisle for some good ol oreida crinkle fries.however, in the spirit of giving them a solid try, we decided to try the dipped italian beef  based off multiple recommendations here. ill give portillos on thing, they are consistent! nothing like discount brand deli sliced roast beef drowned in with some poorly mixed lawrys gravy then stuff in a bun and drowned again before flopping it on a plate. was a greasy, salty mess of yuck!seriously it all tasted like i could have taken the exact same grocery trip and made the dogs, chili, fries, roast beef and gravy at home. its possible that it was a really off day for portillos but i sincerely doubt i will be back to give them another chance.
ive experienced portillos both in chicago and here in tempe,  and both times ive been underwhelmed.  the taste of the dipped sandwich is nice due to the spicy peppers but everything is just so greasy. i dont get the hype.
i honestly dont understand the appeal of this place. ive been here three times now and all three have been utterly mediocre. from the soggy, fairly bland and tasteless food to the disinterested, disconnected customer service. not even the soda is good as the syrup mixture is so low that it tastes mostly like club soda.
i heard a lot about this place from my chitown friends so i thought id take my wife out for lunch. i had the chicken walnut salad and my wife had a burger and fries. to get to the point, it was paradise bakery prices with school cafeteria quality. there is a ton of hype around this place so i was pretty let down when i realized i walked into a carnivallike setting and spent statefair money. after further discussion with friends i came to learn that the only items worth ordering are their beef sandwiches. after seeing the quality of meat they use for their salads dicesized cubes of what appeared to be the chicken version of spam and burgers mcdonalds beef looked more appetizing...i think well pass and spend our money on a local restaurant that serves higher quality food at equal prices. 2 stars because the service was good and it was kid friendly...that was about as good as it got.
the only thing good there was their salads. the burgers and the chicken sandwich stunk. the cashier was to busy talking to his friends and keep asking us what we said. i will never go back to this one, was not worth my money and or time.
not sure whats wrong with this place and why its so difficult to get an order correct. ordered  a burger and waited almost 20 minutes to get it whilst other people after me received their orders promptly. i actually had to approach the counter, ask for my order and was told they werent sure what happened to it.  they eventually gave me my order and were to busy to apologize for the mixup.  last time i was there, they forgot the cheese on the cheese  burger!  pathetic service and wont be returning.
not happy with this selection. nice atmosphere but food was not very good. not worth the cash that i dropped on all of us to eat. probably will not try it again.
had their tuna burger which was a decent sized burger with thick slice of tuna. some friends chose the place and it was good to try but i dont think i want to come back. it was..... ok.
ive eaten here 3 times and it never gets any better. the first time was just to try it out, the 2nd time i had a gift card and the third and last time i was with friends that decided to eat here. the place is confusing, noisy with mediocre fast food. my hamburger bun was soggy, the meat had the texture of shoe leather and the fries were cold. i cant understand why it gets so much hype. never again for me.
my husband really likes this place me on the other hand not so much. i always get a salad which obviously is the wrong thing. the salads are not good and the dressings are not good either. so if you go there dont bother getting a salad!
might as well just do fast food it will have a lot less 50s replica junk on the walls cost less and wreck you just the same on the insides.
sigh. last night couldve been great. though the company was wonderful, our collective experience at pan was not. our party of six arrived early last night, but were taken before our reservation without any trouble. as it turned out, the dining room was empty, save for the tables outside, so a reservation likely wasnt necessary to begin with just a tip in case you plan on going. our server was hyperfriendly and took our drink and food orders quickly. all but one of us took advantage of pans awesome restaurant week special  a bowl and a roll for 20.15.  it seemed too good to be true. we started with the rolls, each chosen from their delectable menu of maki.  i chose the key lime roll complete with scallops and spicy tuna.  among our party there was a dragon roll eel, tempura something, etc., a green roll vegetarian, and one roll that just couldnt make it to the table for some reason. we waited. and waited some more. finally, i dug into my roll, all the while giving my friend the im sorry sideeye. my roll was absolutely delicious.  his arrived well after we all finished, with little explanation.  the server did mention there was a delay shortly after we received our orders, but after that, he didnt say much else.  finally, the roll arrived and we chalked it up to newbie restaurant week jitters. next up were our order of bowls. i opted for the drunken noodle bowl more scallops and wide noodles, while the others chose a variety from pans goodlookin bowl menu. five bowls arrived, but not the sixth. are you kidding? though the guest in question kept his cool i was close to busting my chopsticks over my knee and storming out. i didnt, and ate my bowl in quiet frustration instead. it was okay. the bowl reports across the board were that they were bland, so roll all the way if you decide to visit pan.  after at least 15 minutes, the final bowl arrived and the server admitted it was his fault. thanks, but too little too late. his meal was comped, his drinks werent and we all left with very little chance of ever returning.  hopefully, these issues are just a flash in the pan, for all you yelpers out there, but i wont be among you. there are too many other great options in this amazing city.p.s. the new layout in the dining room leaves a lot to be desired. i wasnt obsessed with tamari, but at least they had a nice collection of booths and tables. if i want one long picnic table ill go to the park.
it wasnt that great when it was tamari and still not great with the new name pan.  we went with a group of 6 for restaurant week and had high hopes.  they have a great outdoor seating area and the restaurant week special was a true deal! for 20.15 you got a choice of a sushi roll appetizer and one of their many bowl entrees. as our group arrived our friendly waiter greeted us and brought out drinks. he made helpful suggestions of the popular picks including the mojito which one in our party ordered. it got an ok review. i went with my go to white lightening in a bottle with an orange.  we all ordered the restaurant week special well except for me and i got a salad.  the salad was mediocrea combo of mango, cucumber, avocado with weird lettuce. the appetizer sushi rolls came out next and one of our friends did not get served his until about 10 minutes after the rest of the group.  the waiter kept promising it would be out shortly and we just figured he must have gotten something that took a long time to make.  the portions of the appetizers were abundant and the presentation was perfect. next up was the entrees. once again all were served except our friend with the late shrimp sushi roll.  the waiter was somewhat apologetic and said it was his faulthe must have forgot his order but we were ready to get the check by the time our friends meal came out.  the manager did stop by but wasnt that apologetic.  they all said they would take care of us which meant him getting his meal for free. this is nice and all but left a bad taste in our mouth no pun intended and the likelihood of going back is slim due to the terrible service. it is no fun having a guest in your party watching others eat their meal.  with that being said the entree bowls had a lot of fresh ingredients from veggies, to noodles and many options of seafood.  also vegetarian options.
eh, the food here was mediocre. definitely not worth the price. the sushi rolls were covered in mayonnaise and other toppings which is always an indication of subpar fish. my entree was burnt. overall, i would say i am in no hurry to return.
i have no idea how this place has four stars. first, the restaurant was blasting club music on the outside patio. i might not mind this if it was later in the evening but it was only 7pm. it was so obnoxious i could barely hear over it. our table was gross and sticky. the waiter got our order wrong  he comped it and the food was only so so. i will definitely not be returning.
i decided to stop last evening for dinner.  i had heard good buzzes about this place, but truly i wasnt impressed. the waitstaff was courteous and attentive, it was happy hour, and the sushi was good. the downfall for me was dessert. it was mentioned desert was freshly prepared on that day and would be avocado creme brulee. yay!excitement lead to disappointment. there was a party upstairs that night and the chef had only planned enough dessert for the party. the chef had to account for all attendees before a dessert could be offered to other diners. fair enough, but there was not another option available. while this didnt pertain to me directly, but the bar ran out of apple pucker to make a drink. the manager had to run to the liquor store. it was a good way to save face, but it was tuesday night. i will consider other dining options in the area before returning.
first time in pittsburgh and we were told to check out lawrenceville. came here based on the reviews on yelp and i was very disappointed. there is indoor and outdoor seating with a nice patio if you are into that. the music is super loud outside and would be hard to have a conversation outside. indoors, the music was not horribly loud, but the playlist consisted of punk rock and just random songs that you wouldnt really expect for an asian fusion restaurant probably could make a music video in here though.food wise, pretty disappointed. i had the chicken tom kah which comes with egg noodles, coconut milk, lemograss, bok choy etc. the bowls they come in are shaped such that the sauce pools at the bottom of the bowl and makes it hard for you to taste the flavor in the noodles. my dish was essentially noodles, bok choy and a small piece of chicken. the sauce itself is watered down and you really cant taste the coconut in it. my girlfriend had the drunken noodles and she had the same problem with the pooling of the sauce and said it was ridiculously salty... not trusting her, i tried it and yup, it was like eating a spoonful of mortons salt... i guess you get your iodine for the day. overall, not a fan of this place. for the price and hype built around it, this place does not do fusion well at all and youd be better served checking out a different asian place. service is quick and our waitress was nice.
tried pan with my husband with a groupon.  i guess their happy hour is half price all drinks which tamari also had, which is a great price and they had just as unique of cocktail offerings as tamari did.  so, 5 starts for happy hour.  however, we were pretty disappointed in the food, even at the groupon price.  we ordered the korean fried chicken, cheek bowl, and the hanger stir fry. we both enjoyed the korean fried chicken, it was perfectly fried, juicy, and the wasabi slaw was a nice compliment.  however, the other 2 dishes were extremely salty, doused in soy sauce, and seemed very oily.  seem like cheap chinese food at a not cheap price.  neither of us eat sushi so i cant comment on that...so well stick to this place for drinks only.
this place puts more effort into its image than it puts into its food. and charges you more for it. its not that the food tastes bad, its just that it isnt great. kind of like a warmed over fancy frozen dinner with extra garnish. the people working there were very nice, and attentive. then again there werent many other customers to worry about.
if this show were solely being rated on talent and performance alone, no question it would be a perfect 5 stars. the caliber of acting, dancing, and singing was breathtaking, the cast was absolutely first rate. i feel compelled to write this hoping someone from the production side of the show will take it to heart. the show deserves to have an amazing success, but in my opinion, the lack of detail on the production side will hinder its chances.first, we couldnt hear anything. the sound system was so terrible and muffled that the beauty and tone of the vocalists was completely drowned by a second rate system that surely was just borrowed from the djs at the light nightclub. it made me so upset because i could hear how gorgeous the singers were, but couldnt understand barely anything they were saying or singing. second, the costumes and hair. wigs had tons of real hair coming out of them, the outfits had panty lines running through them and wrinkles caused by underwear, seams on dresses were poorly hemmed, costume colors were completely mismatched and terribly distracting. this is fine if you are at a little cabaret in the middle of nowhere, but at a show that you pay upwards of 60 dollars to see in one of the nicest hotels in vegas? the attention to detail must be fine tuned. especially for a show that for most people who dont know baz luhrmann by his first name will rely on its reputation. once again, i am writing as a fan who wants to see this go far and wishes the whole production every success.
for most of the show i was wondering what the heck was going on. the sound system was so bad that i couldnt understand a word of what they were saying or doing. the band was really loud, especially the drums so it drowned out the singers. the lighting was terrible too. a lot of the time there were just a bunch of people running around on a dark stage. then they would backlight them with a spotlight that shined directly into my eyes. i thought i had bought the best seats in the house but it turns out that some of the show is behind the seating so we couldnt see what was happening behind us. if you are going to go, then buy in section 301. those seats seem to be better. the actors reproduce scenes fro 3 tragic love stories weaving between romeo and juliet, moulin rouge, and the great gatsby. i liked all 3 movies so i found some pleasure in the beat of the music although i could not understand the words. some of the singers had really good voices. juliet in particular was spectacular. she could win one of the singing shows on tv or have a solo career. id go to a show of just her. if the production manager and director could get their act together this could be a 4 star or better show. they have the talent in the cast it is just managed poorly. also the drinks are pretty awful. we had 2 cocktails and 2 waters for 60. ps: bring a sweater. it is pretty cold in there.
wanted a quote for some  kitchen cabinet removal. they came out and we chatted. the next week i received an email that they would get back to me after a short trip to nm. never heard from them again.my plumber told me a good thing, if they dont call you back nor have the professional courtsey to even email you ,they didnt need the work.
after having a very difficult time making the appointment, the tech was super nice. but after only 4 days, half the lashes are gone on just my right eye. i am not new to lashes and understand the care that is needed the first 2448 hours. i cared for both eyes the same so having one eye with less then half the lashes the other has is not desirable
no privacy at all!!! its opened up with a line of beds.  the young lady that did my lashes was very nice but; she told me if i wanted a lot of lashes i needed to purchase the full fill instead of the natural, so i did.  do not make the same mistake as she only has the one hour and can only do the natural.  she would need another hour to do a volume set.  so i lost out on the money.  do t do the same.  also, use tape instead of the relaxing eye patches as they are almost 11.00.  no lash brush is given to you so purchase one or some before you go if you go.  i get them when i go to others that do my lashes.
i wanted to like this place so bad, especially since most of the reviews seemed to have problems with booking. and i booked right away. i had no problem with customer service, in fact, i thought they were professional and helpful. but i did have a problem with the extensions. they felt sloppy and uneven. unfortunately, i wont be going back.
im really sad that this is what is left of the sugar factory...but still grateful it even still exists. i love getting the goblet drinks, but it just isnt the same without the dry ice. on the plus side, at least you get to keep the goblet as a souvenir this time. also, no food since its not a restaurant, just a stand. so sad.
i miss the sugar factory restaurant they had at paris. they had really good food to match they really tasty drinks. i hear they may open up another sugar factory location that has a restaurant on the north end of the strip. not sure how true that rumor is but one can only hope it does make a comeback.
was not to impressed at all. the middle of the pizza was kinda soggy.  and multiple of the pizzas on the menu all seemed to be the same.  dont think ill be back.  it was a full house when i was there, so i guess other people like it.
the food was mediocre. the concept was amazing! who wouldnt want a pizza made in 90 seconds. the employees were fantastic, but the owner was beyond rude. granted, we never met the guy, but the way he treated his employees was so offputting that i would have a really hard time giving him another dollar. with the competition in downtown gilbert these days, the likelihood to return here is next to none.
the service was excellent,  atmosphere  not so good,  food even worse.  i ordered a marguerite pizza,  it was tasteless and the crust was like eating a cheap steak, chewy.   it was super loud , hard to have a conversation. but i find most restaurants are  loud lately. i doubt  ill return, if i do, ill select outdoor seating on the patio where there is a misting system. and probably  less noisy.
i was really not impressed.my boyfriend and i went here because zinburger had a wait of 45 1hr .the menu  was kind of like their way or no way ...we say at the bar its full service but we had to look for our waitress every time .i wont be back but it was nice trying something new!
i had big hopes for pomo. it is certified to be authentic napolitano style pizza. the location is cramped and it was rather loud. the mural on the wall of naples italy was quite authentic  even down to trash in the street.we ordered our pizzas. a very basic margarita pizza for one 2 if you eat like a bird is 12.95. we got 2 pizzas and one glass of iced tea i had water and the tab was 31.15  tip. now for the pizza review. meh. it tasted good. there was hardly any cheese on it. little sauce although it had good flavor. in all honesty  go to trader joes. in their freezer section, they have organic pizza imported from italy. the flavor is very comparable, the crust is slightly thicker, theres more cheese. they cost about 5 bucks each. grab 2, and a bottle of 2 buck chuck wine which will be the same price as one pizza at pomo, add a salad, invite over a couple of friends and have a great time. oh  fyi  i feel the same about pizza bianco in phoenix. overrated, very, very, very similar taste to the imported trader joes pizza. i wont be going back to either place.
went there for dinner on a tuesday night for the first time. disappointing that happy hour is confined to the 11 bar stools; we were 5 feet away from empty seats and had to pay 7 for a beer lame. pizza was okay not worth the 17 for some sausage and chunks of canned mushrooms joked with my wife that we could each get 3 little caesars for the same price! lol. for two adults and a kid, way too pricey for what we got. call it naples style pizza or whatever, but it was pretty bland and average at best. should have gone for taco tuesday at their sister restaurant, joyride; at least happy hour is honored everywhere in that restaurant and i would have ordered more than one drink.
50 for 2 person pizzas and 2 teas. the young waiter was obviously trained on the bragging rights as they are one of the limited certified  authentic napoletana pizzerias. so since he appeared to be educated after showing the menu i asked if they had capacola? he had no idea what i was even asking and i had to explain what it was. so much for traditional italian knowledge. the pizza i ordered had so much basil i thought i was eating a salad. i had to ask for another plate to remove the pile i had to remove to get to the pizza. as for the quality or taste its no better than fried pie or mod pizza, in fact other than the pizza was a little larger i would say it was a total waste paying over 3 times the cost of the other pizza places that let you select any item you want for the same price of just over 7. i cant imagine how this will last, if its the certification that added the extra cost then it certainly doesnt reflect in the taste or quality. yes its fancier than the other trending pizza joints but not worth the crazy cost difference.
my goodness.  when i go to a classy italian restaurant at the least i expect the waiter to have a knowledge of their wines.  but when i mentioned merlot and his response was isnt that kind of sweet and when i say it is more like a port wine and he responds with pork? i am just taken back.  i do not know who the owner is but when you hire kids in a high end restaurant or at least i think it is high end i expect a knowledgeable waiter!  i know we dont live in a perfect world but i feel the proper response would have been sir, i appologize but merlot is not a wine we carry but we do have an excellent cabernet sauvignon from italy that has a taste and body suitable for a merlot drinker.  the point is overcoming an objection with a solution and in any type of business this is very important.  or, be honest and say sir, i am still in the process of learning my wine list, give me a moment and i will ask the bartender who is also our wine expert.  either way, there is room for improvement with this young man.we spent 20 on the pomo pizza and was let down.  i can get better and cheaper artisan pizzas at franciscos pizza or pizinis next to fat cats.no bread with olive oil was served which blew me away with disappointment.  the appetizer meatballs were overpriced at 10 with very little fan fare to the presentation.  i have to admit this was my first visit and was not familiar with the menu or some of the words but the waiter knew this.  when i ordered the meatballs i thought it would come with pasta then i remember it saying antipasta and figured oh, anti... guess that means no.  i just felt a bit overwhelmed and i am sure that added to my experience plus it was my birthday dinner.the back of the chairs are not very comfortable and cause you to lean back a bit for support.for me if i am craving italian at half the price i will go to oreganos if i find myself in old town gilbert.  i guess these new business owners to this area forget that there is plenty of competition and if you do not get your guests on your first visit there will not be a second chance, at least not with me.note:  i will say that the d.m. has reached out to me, offered his apologies and has invited me to come back which i am gracious for but i will still have to give it a great deal of consideration.  i honestly hope they succeed as i am a strong proponent of small local business making it.
the waitress was amazing. so attentive and friendly but the pizza...wow. worst pizza i have had in years. cold, limp, no cheese, watery sauce and fell apart when you picked it up. the pizza was cold the second it touched our table. will not be back.
the atmosphere at pomo is very cool. laid, back easy vibe. bartenders are fun and chatty. the misters outside are way to strong and over powering. the prices are 34 too much. very disappointed that kids meals dont include a drink, so you pay an additional 1.50 for kids drinks. my oldest daughter got pepperoni pizza, but it was salami and under cooked. my younger daughter ordered pasta and it was a small amount for 6. my husband and i ordered gluten free and sadly, it was the worst gluten free pizza we have ever had. the sauce, the cheese and the toppings were great but the crust was not even editable. extremely disappointed in the waiter for not asking how our meal was! he took our plates away, completely full, and did not ask us what we thought. thrilled that downtown gilbert is now a great place to hang out and eat, sad that pomo isnt better.
authentic isnt the word i would to describe this place.  first off it looks like every other place down town gilbert.  we ordered a pizza and a salad.  the pizza toppings were good;  bail,  eggplant one.  the crust on the other hand was void of flavor all together.  the chicken salad was the same, dry and flavorless.  our server was amazing and the staff seemed to really care.  the wine was good
sunday funday. we have friends that rave about pomo, lets check it out.sunday afternoon.....dead. we were 2 of maybe 10 people in there.good beer selection on tap, and i ordered meatball appetizer right away.wait, 10 for 2 meatballs?.......that sucks.couldnt bring myself to order a 12 inch pizza that would cost me 17. not a fan. too pricey for us.
ordered for delivery. have ordered from this locationbefore they moved several times before, with no issues. however, when sandwiches arrived the bread was hard, even my 7 and 5yr old thought it was hard as a rock! my husband called and spoke with the manager, just to let him know the bread was terrible. the manager told him that, it was not possible the bread was only 4 hours old. he was very rude. i myself work in the casino industry, and believe in service recovery, none of that here! definitely do not plan on visiting this location again.
walking in the vibe was off and weird. i stood at the counter deciding on what i wanted and when i was ready no one was there to take my order, everyone walked away. when someone did come up to ask if i was ready i said yes and she looked at me weird, it got awkward until i took the hint and moved over to her register. once there i felt like i was being rushed in explaining my order, when it was time to pay i swiped my card, but the machine wasnt working properly. the cashier made me feel as if it were my fault by telling me that i was doing it wrong and that i needed to swipe it correctly. she the took my card and swiped it herself. after it was clear that the damage didnt come from my end she got the manager to help, i paid for my food, was given my sandwich and just stared at. no, thank you or have a nice day. went to get a straw and couldnt find them, i asked where they were after a good minute of looking and was told with so much attitude it threw me off. i almost wanted to just take my food to go. i sat down and started eating and noticed that the bread at the bottom of my sandwich was hard, i asked that it be fixed and while the manager was accommodating the employees seemed like i was burdening them. i got my sandwich remadebread still was hard and over cooked and left.
this place is owned by the same man that owned the franchised qdoba.  been going to qdoba for 15 years..it started to become hit or miss.  now that its central taco....downhill.  some easy fixes maybe some seasoning in the beans black and pinto, the grilled veggies and fajita veggies have absolutely no flavor. its simple...flavor your food!!!! this place will be closed by end of year. not consistent and food lacks any flavor. quality check your food if you want to succeed.
are you serious with this? i understand youre trying to take over whatever qubobo was doing, but cant you have some flair or personality of your own? the food sucks. i ordered the nachos. the chips were stale, the chicken had no flavor, and the nacho cheese was seriously watered down. they have no logo, the place is dark and dank, and the menu is confusing. i hate this place, im never going back.
i was excited to have a popeyes in the gilbert area but now that excitement has quickly left after receiving cold fries, cold extra dried out chicken tenders and a lost order. opening day was thursday, july 2nd, needless to say there where a lot of bodies but the bodies where not placing orders but instead where taking and preparing the orders. i counted 12 workers in the back and many seemed confused, i think the confusion came from the management team that was showing the workers what to do and how to do it which from what i could see caused a few wrong orders to be giving out such as mine. i ordered a 16pc mixed family meal and i received an 12pc nonmixed order with cold fries.i returned on saturday to place three orders with one of those orders being chicken tenders and the tenders where cold and dried and once again the fries where cold. but on a positive note the chicken nontenders that was provided on each visit was fresh, hot and great. i think they may be preparing too many tenders and fries estimating their need for the items and they are falling short in that area so they are serving cold and dry fries  tenders.lessons learned: always check orders  always ask for fresh fries  tenders.
2nd visit. 1st time was very good across the board. service and food quality was great. this visit not so much. ordering was a journey. 3 of the cashiers were with one customer for a extended amount of time. ordered 2 three piece meals to go. when we opened the boxes it was not similar at all. totally different contents. obviously disappointed. will go back but will check contents there before leaving.
okay, i am going to preface this review by saying the food is great as always. big fan of the chicken tenders and sides etc. i work at a dealership across the street and we all go here a lot since its opened. with that said, theres been a lot of mess ups by these guys and i dont blame the entry level food servers as much as i do the managers and leadership, because they need to get their sht together and ill give you a few examples. the three times ive been through the drive thru, something was jacked up every time. other guys at my work, theyve had similar mishaps. the first time, they had given me a family sized meal instead of an individual so it was tons of food and a huge side portion. i hadnt been to popeyes in a long time and thought 15 was a lot lol and they also didnt put any bbq dip or the cajun sparkle in the bag. second time i went i made sure to get the right 3 piece meal and they gave me a couple packages of sparkle and now two sauces then he proceeds to hand me my receipt, fork, sparkle, two dips and my credit card back to me stacked on top of the box nearly falling out of the dudes hand... i asked where the bag was and he replied with oh we dont give out bags... i said okay you all just let the stuff fall all over the place? where am i supposed to put this sht in my freakin glove box? wtf? anyway, the 3rd and most recent visit today i asked for the bag, made sure my drink was the right one, and made sure i had dipping sauce and sparkle... check. get back to the store and i knew i should have looked inside the damn box because i got what was essentially one chicken strip and two freakin chicken nuggets... not even enough to be considered half a strip each. look, this is a new place and im sure these guys are new and not the seasoned 15hr veterans, but come on! get it right! it starts with management! fix these stupid f ups and youll be doing much better. thats all... still good chicken though.
this popeyes is near my house so i figured id check it out. the food was good, like every other popeyes. my gripe is with the service. i have visited 3 times and three times they got my order wrong. missing a dressing, unsweetened tea instead of sweet tea, not spicy tenders instead of spicy. ok, fine, not a big deal. but when i went back to have the order corrected i was met w such attitude it was unbelievable! i wasnt asking for anything other than the order that i had paid for. this location is 03. nope wont be back!
i went through the driveup window at around 9:30 pm.i ordered the cajun fries and cole slaw.there was only one car ahead of me.but it took some 7 minutes for them to receive their order.i got my order within 23 minutes.as i dipped my hand into the bag of fries i was disappointed in that they were only luke warm.and after consuming several of them i noticed that portions of them were dried out and had the texture of beef jerky.what really upset me is that in the 7 minutes that i waited for the previous order they could have cooked up a fresh batch of fries.i suppose that when one comes so close to closing time that they get what they deserve.
in a nutshell, the washroom, salad bar and service are the only positives i can mention about this place. the sushi is downright abysmal. where should i start? there is twice as much rice as you should get on the rolls, the green dragon roll is mostly rice and cucumber the shrimp in it is barely there, the spicy tuna roll had no tuna, just tempura batter, they use too much mayonnaise and the fish taste is completely lost among the other ingredients, that is, if you can see the fish.the sushi quality at yes is a 100 times better than here and this should tell you everything you need to know about this place. although my experience came only after one lunch, im not wondering if i should give it another try...
what a nice day for sushi, we thought as we were driving for lunch. we were sadly mistaken after a poor experience to say the least. dont get me wrong, the food was magnificent. the bacon wrapped crab was exceptional and the green dragon roll has the perfect combination of creamy avocado and crispy panko crust. the sushi rolls were well prepared and tasted delicious. the general tso chicken was surprisingly well done, however was garnished with one leaf of lettuce... odd. the salad bar was the definition of mediocrity, and the dipping sauces from some items came noticeable late. the service was lacking. food was delivered relatively quickly however our water was filled maybe once and other requests were slow. only 3 of our party of 4 ate, however the server was insistent on charging all of us full price. needles to say we were displeased. the worst part was the servers unwillingness to understand the situation, and lack of sympathy for the matter.on the way out there were mints and jelly beans available, however we had to help ourselves instead of being offered them by the extra member of staff who was standing around doing nothing. i took both a few mints and a pinch of jelly beans. be warned, the jelly beans were the gross booger flavoured kind. overall experience was a 4.510
been there twice. the first day had the chopped beef sandwich yesterdays left over brisket soaked in sauce.  it was good, however i would be willing to pay more for a quality bun.  the cheesy potatoes are excellent.  the second time i had ribs and brisket.  one slice of brisket was juicy and delicious.  the rest of the brisket was so dry i couldnt swallow it without a drink. the ribs do not fall off the bone and lack any seasoning besides smoke.  i would not order the ribs again.  overall its ok and there are no other options for half way decent bbq in surprise.  the line moves at a snails pace because every sandwich is weighed on a scale.  the portions are good, but i would think after serving 100s of sandwiches a day you could eyeball the appropriate meat for a sandwich and speed along the ordering process.
my family has been looking forward to giving this new bbq restaurant here in surprise a try for a long time.  after countless delays, and missed opportunities due to the restaurant being closed we had our chance!  since there are three of us, we decided on the family meal with slaw and beans as sides.  our first choice was cheesy potatoes, but as often is the case mentioned in other reviews, they were out of something.  overall i will say the menu is pretty limited, and you shouldnt expect to find the variety you would find at a rudys, or honey bears.  as for the food, put it this way.  we ended up throwing most of everything out and going to plan b.  the positive was the lean quality of the pulled pork.  thats where it ends however.  the meat had absolutely no flavor, the store bought hamburger rolls they give you tasted stale, the bbq sauce tasted only like ketchup, the beans had no flavor or texture, and the slaw was dry and loaded with ground pepper.  i rate got que?  a two out of five based on the lean quality of the pork and friendly staff.  overall however i just literally throw 25 in the trash, and just dont see a reason to return.  sadly, if you want quality que, you will have to keep making the drive to outside of surprise.
the pulled pork is really good ive had the brisket it seems as though the food is cooked somewhere else and then brought to the restaurant in aluminum trays. unfortunately there are only three items on the menu in the meat department. you have pork ribs beef brisket and pulled pork. i sure wish they had chicken. also there are no orders taken over the telephone. i was shopping next door and wanted to pick up a family size meal and they refused to take the order on the phone they insisted that i come in and order it and sit and wait.
2nd time here. i wasnt impressed much. the meat plate was just a few tiny pieces and 2 fatty ribs. i dont think there is any value with the meals and for 13.00 i should have left a little full and felt like i got my moneys worth. i think after my 2nd visit that i should have a better opinion and now i do. i feel that portion control is strictly for their favor and that you dont get a value for your dollar here. taste was so so. i dont plan to return again.
how could a restaurant run out of food at 6:00pm? what they did have was okay, not great but not bad.
101915. in response to the business owners newly edited comments: youre reading a lot of things into my review that arent there. i will limit the rest of my response to the relevant parts. 1 you should avoid making an item available for purchase if its just experimental. 2 i appreciate your generous offer, but i will decline it in the mean time.i guess i was bound to run into a big disappointment after trying so many food trucks.dude wheres my hotdog is yet another las vegas food truck pumping out wieners. unless those other trucks, they actually did show up to the great american foodie fest. another difference: theyre not as good.i visited this truck at the end of a long day, and i let my friend scope out a food truck because i had already tried all of the savory food trucks that id really wanted to. i tried a new hot dog called the laz butter sauce, sliced ham, mayo, swiss, pickles, mustard, and the lobster corndog.the laz, which they described as a take on a cuban sandwich, just wasnt that good. all of the components tasted boring and plain, and i didnt find much of a butter sauce if any. the bun was especially underwhelming. it brought no texture or flavor to the table.the lobster corndog had good texture and temperature in both the meat and the corn shell, but the flavors were simply bland compared to something like a lobster roll. the sriracha mayo wasnt coming through at all. it needed more oomph.they have style and charm, but their food is not impressive in comparison to their competition. i dont understand at all how they were voted as best of las vegas in 2015 when there are so many other superior hot dog places, let alone hot dog trucks.
nah, son. we stopped here on the way to our hotel after our flight from nj. my colleague said to just pick anything out i saw along the way. i somehow expected any mexican place in arizona to be good, kinda like in san diego. apparently i was wrong. i love carnitas. our waiter raved about the carnitas there when i expressed my interest. dude was either full of caca or has never had good carnitas in his life. ive never had carnitas so dry before. this place is obviously about serving large portions for low prices  but the quality is lower than the prices. i wasnt even feeling the fried ice cream here. its not easy to get me to talk negatively about dessert, yo.the cadillac margarita was okay. and if it werent for the frida kahlo art on the walls i would chalk this experience up as a total loss. frida gets a star all her own.oh, saw the end of the giants49ers game where the giants won it in the last few minutes. that was good too.
i walkedin and wanted to hate this place, but it wasnt really that bad. i was searching for a hot and new spot via the yelp app and the peoples republic came up. this place is located next to the harley davidson cafe and chilis. i know, i know, how many red flags must i ignore before the ultimate demise of my palate.during my search i noticed a checkin offer for a free soft pretzel with the purchase of 20oz porterhouse steak, really? im going to buy a thirtytwo dollar steak in hopes of getting a soft pretzel, cmon guys! heres the kicker they dont even offer the 20oz anymore, now its a 16oz porterhouse. the style of this place is a tad confusing, it looks like sports bar, but with stained glass windows and a lot of brick, it could maybe pass for an english pub? my server jason came by and was very personable and fast. he took our orders promptly and even gave us some recommendations and info about the menu.  still nothing on the menu really intrigued me except for the loco moco balls. i also ordered deep fried artichoke and a breakfast pizza. the loco moco balls were interesting. hand shaped rice balls with spam inside instead of hamburger meat, then deepfried and served with a side of gravy. these were probably the best the thing of the night and thats not saying much. way too much rice and hardly any spam inside, plus the side of gravy was clearly from a packet. the fried artichoke was ok, but the dipping sauce that it came with completely overpowered any artichoke flavor. the breakfast pizza... oh, the breakfast pizza. it was processed cubed ham, bagged cheese and sauce from a can, all on flat bread with a fried egg. guys, when you have people scrutinizing every bite of every meal nowadays it would really behoove you to not cut corners and get real products on the menu.this place could be good, but the food fell so flat that wile e. coyote even winced. the service was on point and the view from the patio was great, just not great enough to save my experience.
fish tacos are definitely not worth the price. and if you are given a coupon for buy 1 drink at regular price and get an additional drink free, realize that they only honor those coupons under very specific circumstances. not worth the 
we were craving a snack and cocktail and drawn to peoples  republic because of outdoor seating.  it was a little windy, but refreshing.  we ordered appetizers:  fried calamari , which were cold, soggy, and a measly serving size; fried artichoke hearts, which were good, wings, 8 in the order for 13.99 just under 2 per one wing joint, and delicious cheesy puffs.  the drinks were average.  ordered a moscow mule, but no mint.  asked for water refill, which came 15 minutes later. all the servers looked busy but didnt feel the service for the 100 we spent on 4 appetizers  and 4 drinks.
food is good but service is extremely slow. staff are friendly but expect to be here all night before you get service unless youre outspoken and actually ask for service.
this place really has nothing special about it...almost feel they invested more into their signage and not the food which was blah
im choosing to believe that this location is still going through the workingoutthekinks phase of being new and thats why ive been disappointed both times ive been here. im no noodles  co newbie as ive been to the south blvd location and experienced much better tasting food there.on my first visit, i went with what i knew and got the japanese pan noodles. my dish happened to be completely devoid of broccoli and the noodles were dry even though they were heavily coated in sauce. for my second visit, i got the pad thai with chicken. unfortunately, i couldnt really taste any typical pad thai flavors. it tasted more inspired by pad thai rather than actual pad thai. i will say that the service was good both times i visited and callingordering ahead really is a timesaver.
nothing to really write home about with this place. i ordered the pesto pasta with chicken. i personally think i can make it better at home. at least they gave me free dessert since i came late in the night close to closing time.
this place was ok. we tried it out yesterday and had a good afternoon, and the food was good. we did the mini golf, which was fun but nothing id feel like i had to do again. the bowling looked cool. the video games were the real let down. 1 a game? every game? that drives me nuts. there werent many games to choose from and they were all way overpriced.the manager was a bit overzealous. on several occasions, i was asking a question to an employee, the employee is kindly answering my questions, and in swoops the manager, interrupts the employee, and hijacks our conversation. have some faith in your employees, man! theyre good kids. your personal intensity is freaking me out. the food is stupid disorganized. if youre bowling, they find you and bring you your food. if youre not bowling, you have to just periodically check the food window to see if you find something that resembles your order and ask someone to hand it to you. they dont call out names or numbers to tell you your order is ready. and forks are a real commodity around here. they hand you one when you place your order, and you get to carry it around until your food arrives. if you lose it, you will have to find an employee, do several versions of jazz hands to get their attention, explain and repent for losing said fork, then wait while they figure out where the forks are kept.now heres my warning to all beware the carpet divot at the entrance. it tripped my son when we first walked in, and then my husband walks up to us later, he looks shaken, and he shows me a rug burn swelling up on his hand. the carpet tripped him and he fell on his face. nobody said a word! wheres the overzealous manager when one of your customers is on the floor?i must give props to the 8 year old little blond kid youve got running the place. i hope you treat him well. i saw him cleaning the food area, being an usher at the movie counter, and redeeming game points at the prize counter. he should be overzealous managers boss.total price for family 1 kids pizza hey was i supposed to get a drink with that? cuban panini, small fries, 1 med drink, 20 game card  mini golf for 3 60. i wish this was a little better but it was a decent way to blow off an afternoon. we might go back but i doubt it.
this review is for the food we received....my oldest daughter16 and i went to see in the theater today minions. we ordered two chicken paninis and had them delivered to us before our movie started. both paninis were incredibly hard, im talking break a tooth hard.  my daughters had little to no chicken on hers. we also werent given forks to eat the pasta that comes as a side dish. the food was cold like it had been sitting awhile before being delivered to us. im very disappointed with todays visit.
nice enough. but we will never go back. the location is great, and fun things to do, but it doesnt make up for how rude some of the people were to the kids. one employee yelled at one of the kids in our group for using too much strength on the strength tester game, and at another child because he was playing with one of the window stick toys at the window. we found it inappropriate that he would do so instead of speaking calmly to the children or to the adults who were standing right there. especially since four out of ten kids got yelled at while we were there. and there were eight adults watching the children, so the children were not unattended.
me and my wife went back for our second visit. we arrived just after 11am on  friday, 7242015. i would have sworn it was mothers day sunday, it was crazy busy. we were told a 20 minute wait, it was longer. once again, the music is so loud, along with the people noise, its just to loud. we finally get a table, a half booth with a bench and a funky, uncomfortable plastic chair, our server was so nice, but i had to have him repeat what he said a few times due to the noise. my wife ordered the breakfast pot piesnoozes homemade rosemary sausage gravy smothers a flaky puff pastry, topped with an egg your style wed say sunny side up!. youve reached breakfast bliss, complete with hash browns. 9.00. she was not impressed. no bliss reached here. how can you call a puff pastry, that has nothing on the inside, but has gravy over the top a pot pie? i had a bite, and i too, thought it was plain.i had the snooze breakfast burritoburrito filled with scrambled eggs, hash browns, house black beans, cheddar  jack cheese, topped with pico de gallo and choice of green chili or ranchero  psst, love your veggies  meats  i added pulled pork. it is rather large, topped in green sauce. i cut it open down the middle, and i could see the shredded cheese, it had not melted. this is a giant pet peeve of mine. the inside had spots that were warmer then others, but the cheese not melted, still looking like it just came out of a bag, not good. i ate some of the giant tortilla, but then just the insides.  i did not finish, lost my appetite, my wife didnt want a bite. its not vey appetizing to look at. i think they need to put this in a very hot oven, to really get it hot inside. i didnt tell our server, we had waited long enough. we shared the pineapple upside down pancakesbuttermilk pancakes with caramelized pineapple chunks, housemade vanilla creme anglaise and cinnamon butter. this was the best part of our breakfast. the pineapple chunks were warm, no way were the caramelized. 7.50 for two pancakes. very sweet, gooey, good!.after trying snooze for a second time, i have lowered my rating to 2 stars.  the loud music, loud chatter noise, long wait turned me way off.  i dont mind a long wait if the end result is satisfaction if the food was great, then maybe, maybe, i would over look the other things, but with this much going against it, we wont be back. i now , along with my wife, give snooze a big doh!
a fun an unique menu that wasnt executed very well. a long 65 minute wait left our family of five crammed into a 4 top. the benedicts were well cooked but simply not that tasty. for a family of 5 the bill was 100ish. could have gone to dennys, village inn or egg i am and had a much better experience for a more reasonable price.
food was great, but not worth the hour and a half wait. would have been easier if they said it would be 90 minutes instead of 3045 minutes. asked the hostess how much longer it might be at the 50 min mark and she said she doesnt know. if we knew it was going to be that long, we would have gone somewhere else. seems to be slow at cleaning tables and getting people moving. when we were seated, the service was slow as well, which i imagine contributed to the problem. once we got our food, it was amazing. not sure how much of it was due to us being that much more hungry though. would go back if the wait isnt that long but should have left after a half hour.
it is the cutest restaurant in gilbert.  love the decor and branding but we were not blown away by the food or service.  the concensus at our table was that the sweet potato and chocolate chip pancakes were awesome, the strawberry shortcake pancake was decent , the blueberry danish pancake needs work the pecan crumble tasted oddly like bacon, and the corned beef hash was just average.  the server was slow, not particularly friendly but attentive.  i think they need a few more weeks to work out the kinks.  get there  early!  we got right in at 7am on a sunday but there was a 3045 min wait when we were leaving.  the flight of pancakes is an interesting idea for those who like variety, but when you only enjoy one of the 3 it makes for a pricey pancake. oh and the hot chocolate is just warm chocolate milk. the bill for our table of 4 was about 80...not a great deal for the quality. we wouldnt have minded paying that amount if the food was amazing, but it wasnt. i guess we could all have used a mimosa. ;
i dont understand what the hype is all about. we waited an hour saturday around 10:30am. it was packed. we sat outside after waiting for an hour outside in the sun. its too hot to have tables outside in the sun with no misters. we were able to sit half way in the shade after a while, but still didnt help with the heat. service was mediocre, ran out of water a few times and had to flag people down for refills, ordered the omelette..... nothing but grease. hash browns had no taste to them at all....... just really not worth the hype or the wait. i think its just busy because its a newer place in old town gilbert. dont let it fool you, honestly if you are going to wait an hour, it should be worth it!
sunday, july 26, was a 40 minute wait so my husbandi left.  returned july 30 w my 10 yr old grandson.  waited less than ten minues for a table.  what would you expect on your plate if you ordered blueberry danish pancakes?  i thought the pancakes would have blueberries inside especially since they are in season right now.   swirled on top is blueberry coulis which is a fancy way of saying blueberry syrup.  no blueberries inside just centered w a dollop of lemony cream cheese. the kid french toast didnt look that great and my grandson thought it so so.  the server did offer me another cup of coffee but not before i had a chance to drink any of my first cup.  i was not offered more again.  they forgot our side of eggs not a big deal but when they came promptly they looked nice but were a bit on the cold side.  also, i love boyds coffee.  it is served at gilbert house and butterfields in scottsdale.  the coffee here was just okay.   my mistake inserting blueberries into the description of the pancakes but its what our human brains do.  our experience does not warrant a second visit.
horrible service. food was great, but that quickly did not matter while we were there. we ate at the bar, for it was super busy and packed. i finished my coke within the first 10 minutes of getting it, way before i got my food, and never got a refill even when i asked for one. they looked annoyed when we told them we needed a few more minutes to decide what to order. one of them even rolled her eyes. may not seem like a big deal, but they are in a customer service business. honestly, we probably wont ever go back to this location. we might try the other ones but definitely not this one!
very disappointing service, after waiting 45 minutes for a table, our server only wanted to take drink orders even though we told him we were ready to order. ten minutes later he came back with drinks and took our order, i had pancakes that were luke warm and my wife had eggs benedict that were not hot at all. never seen the waiter again until a man in his mid forties walked in and talked to each employee, owner probably, our server did a complete 180, stopping by, smiling and getting refills. the owner should be there everyday so the servers give good service. we would not waste our time waiting for a table here again.
this is the second time ive tried a snooze restaurant. the first was at their main location and the two benedicts we ordered took around 45 minutes and then came out cold. i gave them the benefit of the doubt because they are always busy and the staff is friendly and the restaurant is just a cool setting. we ate at the new gilbert location this morning, came in around 10am and told us there was a 45 minute wait... no problem we expected it on a saturday. they called us on time sat down and ordered 2 scrambles and a kids pancake, all three meals came out cold. we sent one back and they brought out a new dish in less than ten minutes. they took it off the bill but this was the second time as snooze restaurant  brought us cold food, i mean how do you mess up eggs?  anyway there are so many great restaurants in gilbert this one needs to do a better job to attract and keep customers. next time well be going to liberty market, postinos, or even lolos which is doing a better job since opening up.
the hubby and i have been here twice since it opened. both times were on a sunday, and the wait was excruciating long. im not going to fault the restaurant since im sure the longer lines are due to its newness and the weekend brunch crowd. however, i cannot excuse the lack of professionalism and disorganization throughout. it is obvious that the staff needs more training. they have brought us wrong orders, sat and moved us to different tables, and forgotten to check on us  bring us items that we requested, like straws. the food is inconsistent. the strawberry shortcake pancakes were delicious, but the egg benedicts were hit or miss. four eggs, two of which were not poached correctly, and two were perfect. i think given more time, the front and kitchen staffs will work out their kinks. but i think ill give it a couple of months before i give it another try.
i probably will not go back to snooze due to the deafening noise. we could not gear our own conversation. there was no music it was just the building design.i did not care for the flavor of the hash brown potatoes. poached eggs were fine. asked for crisp bacon, was severed to me almost raw, they took bacon back and brought crispy bacon back.
i would like to preface with the fact that i have really never left a bad review as bad as the one im about to give. i worked in the food industry and i get the whole being short staffed super busy on a sunday morning thing, i really truly do. however...snooze is overhyped, understaffed, unappreciative of its customers. this 80s themed breakfast joint seemed like a perfect hip place to have a family breakfast this morning, and especially so for my sisters last meal with us before she moved out of state. boy, were we fooled! upon our arrival i had my two year old son, my sister and her boyfriend, my parents, and my grandmother. we def anticipated a 45 minute wait so when we approached the hostess stand we were very content at being quoted 45 minutes. not too bad for downtown gilbert on sunday morning. 65 minutes later i had to approach the hostess stand and ask how much longer of a wait we were going to have. you have three more large groups ahead of you, so maybe 1015 minutes. 7075 minute wait total this was after my whole family sat outside sweating our asses off. heres a hint snooze owner, we live in arizona, not sure if youve either a. ever been here, or b. lived through an arizona summer, but its pretty standard to have misters, fans, something. its great that you offer water and hot coffee but lets be real, iced coffee would have been more satisfying to your customers, and cold water, not pipe temperature luke warm water that really doesnt cool your internal temp down. now, i do understand that there is availability to stand inside but its so packed in the lobby area which isnt a lobby that you cant really stand comfortably, especially with a two year old and about 40 other hot, sweaty bodies. finally the hostess is ready to seat us, oh and let me say that i had approached the stand about three times after our given wait time and the hostess taking names never remembered who i was. its called surprise and delight to which this woman did not. hire suggestion, find someone whos younger and mature enough to put a little pep into their voice. i mean really snooze? youre a multilocation breakfast joint. breakfast is the pivotal moment in everyones morning and from the look and sound of almost all the customers around me you ruined that for a lot of people today.upon being seated we sit at a table closer to the door so we have feel a breeze because we were seated outside where there were again no fans or misters. after everyone sits down and begins to settle at the table some other, either hostess or kitchen staff member comes over to the table and tells us this table is for another party and we need to move over to the other table. it would have been one thing if she had asked us kindly, but she was pretty rude about it and didnt apologize. so, my family gets up and moves over to a table sitting in the sun. the waitress who ends up coming over to serve us is the only one who apologized, showed any enthusiasm, and was kind. she helped us move the table more into the shade and grabbed a high chair for us. if it wasnt for her id be giving a one star review. she was prompt about getting our order in and very understanding that we were starving and sweaty. it took her a bit of time to bring us ice water she even brought a kids cup for my son but she came to the table and explained she wanted to ensure a timely delivery of our food. may i also say that this waitress had been outside serving people all morning long who have also been cranky and irritated at their entire experience thus far and she truly upheld the moral part of running a restaurant. serving good food to good people. for the price the food costs i expected better. the food was good no less, but it wasnt any better than the good egg down the street who has a shorter wait, happier staff, and indoor only seating during the summer. i ordered my son french toast which had good flavor and syrup, but the bread was a little dry and lacked a little in texture. the hashbrowns were great. they came very close to beating beths cafe in seattle wa, which has been a 5 year mission of mine. my dad ordered a simple eggs benedict sandwich which did not have a good portion of hollandaise sauce and fell short. everyone else seemed fairly happy with their food and as was i. however, like i said it did not live up to the hype or my expectations which were not set high at any point, not just because the service minus our waitress was the worst ever, but because snooze has expanded too quick  too soon. the recipes should be revisited and refocused. the interiors were fun  simple, however like ive said; its arizona dont have outdoor seating during the summer, its a different story when the high is 80 degrees. overall, there is significant room for improvement. owner of gilbert snooze, if you would like more feedback, im more than happy to give some so you can create a more positive experience for everyone.
i was expecting a wait due to the place being so new and highly hyped up.  i was pleasantly surprised when we were seated right away.  the place was pretty noisy should really do something about the acoustics and maybe play more family friendly music  i was super excited as i had looked at the menu online and had an idea of what i wanted already.  my honey ordered french toast neat  basic french toast with some berries on top nothing special for the price paid for it.  i ordered a breakfast burrito with the ranchero sauce specifically because the waitress recommended that sauce and ended up with green chili sauce.  if you are going to go out of your way to recommend a particular sauce, make sure you put the order in right!  food was good, but for the price, i could have fed an entire family with breakfast burritos at home.i am a firm believer that employees should have a breakroom to take breaks in.  obviously, i dont know what the back of the house looks like and if they have one or not, but i should not have to witness employees literally plopping down in the booth with their friends who are eating there like they are just relaxing in their own home.  this is super tacky.there should be no reason for messing up when the place was not that busy.  however, on top of the previous notes, our waitress actually tried to get us to pay twice.  she brought the bill, we paid cash and said no change.  i was not entirely done eating at that point, so a couple of minutes later, she came to pick up my plate and brought the bill again.  i want to give this place a second chance as there are other things on the menu that sound good, but it might be quite a while before we go back.
my wife and i visited around 7:00 on labor day. i really wanted to like snooze.   very nice decor and a friendly waitress, but the food let the team down.  i ordered eggs over medium with chicken sausage and an english muffin.  the eggs were over easy.  the english muffin was slightly warm, but not toasted.  i had to ask for jam. the chicken sausage was  very peppery, cayanne, maybe.  the peppery sausage taste mystified our waitress who cheerfully offer to bring me something else.  but the replacement sausage links never arrived.  the only really good thing on my plate was the hash browns which were quite nice.she ordered the blueberry danish pancakes.  they were dry enough that she had to request syrup on the side.  one or two bites of the pancakes tasted like onionspeppers.  something was off in the kitchen.
we arrived at 12:30 on a saturday and expected to have a waitit was 30 minutes, 10 minutes for the waiter and 2025 minutes for the food to come out.  didnt expect to make it an afternoon outing! food was amazing; however, the sound in the place was at a level my family had to yell to talk.  remember how it is when you go to a concert? same thing...    the waiter got our choice wrong and i think it was because he didnt hear the order in the first place!  in addition to the loudness in the restaurant, they had the music turned up so it sounded like a base boom box.  we left and literally my husband and i had headaches and tense necks!   moral of the story:  even when there is amazing food, you should never have to hurry to eat it to get out of the restaurant. especially when it was 48.00.
the food was incredibly delicious, but the noise level made the overall experience pretty unnerving.i certainly understand some level of ambiance; being in my 20s, i have no problem frequenting loud clubs and bars. i just wasnt expecting to have to yell my order at the server who had to lean in to hear me. the servers attention and attitude was fine.reign the music back a tad and invest in some sound dampening panels or area rugs and id totally be back. otherwise, probably not.but. well. you know. thats just like. my opinion man.
this is my third visit. the food is always good. i love the espresso bar and the added fixings to your entrees, especially the barbacoa!  unfortunately, this visit was stressful. we were seated outside next to the outdoor games. the kids and commotion made it difficult to enjoy our breakfast. even my own kids were bothered by it. i recommend this restaurant but i will wait to be seated inside next time. i was bummed because it was excited to take my family here for the first time and they didnt enjoy it.
the food, although tasty, was lukewarm. i requested my daughters pancakes with chocolate chips and nothing else on them. they came out smothered in powdered sugar. i would have sent everything back but between the wait to be seated and the time it took to get the food out, we were pretty hungry. i finished my coffee halfway through my meal and never was given a refill. same with my daughters juice. its brand new and hyped up, so obviously its very busy and loud, so it just isnt a very pleasing atmosphere. despite being so busy the servers dont seem to move with much urgency. i was pretty disappointed because i keep hearing how amazing it is. again, the food did taste very good, but it wasnt a good experience overall. ill probably give it another chance after the hype dies down.
im convinced many of the reviewers were either too hungry to care about the food, or still sleeping, because i am baffled at how this place compares to anything beyond the waffle house.the only things worth compliments were the nowait experience i went monday morning and the very nice server. and the eggs. i ordered mine over easy and they were perfect.and thats about it folks. the hash browns are mealy and under seasoned, the chicken sausage is a haphazardly shaped disk made with ground chicken and overly used sausage seasoning, the coffee is no different than what you get in a drive thru, and the french toast is similar to what your mom makes...just bigger...and embellished with random sauces. if you think thats worth waiting and paying forhave at it. an alternative is just make your own meal. if you want to feel like youre at snooze, just wait 2 hours before serving yourself.
i enjoyed two cups of coffee and the front lobby ambience here this morning, for an hour, as i waited for my table and watched people who came in before me get seated...before me.  wed requested a table for two, at the first available spot: inside, outside, at the bar....didnt care.we kept checking our text messages as we thought maybe wed missed our text alert that our table was ready.  nope, we hadnt missed anything.  yet people were walking in and being taken right back because their party, by blind luck, happened to fit the correct size requirements for the table that was currently available.  i know i wasnt alone in my anger and confusion over why people who came in after me were being seated after me because i watched a steady stream of other waiting patrons walk up to check on what was going on with their table too.  this seating arrangement seems grossly unfair.did i mention that i did this for an hour before i finally got mad and left?  and the kicker?  when we finally told them to cancel our table and that we were leaving boom a table for 2 was suddenly available!i was at the snooze in downtown denver two weeks ago where i enjoyed amazing food, stellar service and our party was seated in 15 minutes flat, with none of this seating stupidity. get your shit together, snoozegilbert.  honestly...
definitely not worth it! after going to snooze i was disappointed in the food. i ordered the danish blueberry pancakes and they were cold when served and bland. i maybe ate half of the plate and didnt even want to take the rest home. i also ordered a side of hash browns and two scrambled eggs. the hash browns had no flavor and were too soft for my liking. the eggs werent even good. i honestly wish we had gone to ihop instead and that is saying something.
i usually love snooze. my boyfriend and i fell in love with the san diego location and the tempe location so when we saw a gilbert option we were pumped. well, our first visit was just okay. the food wasnt that hot it was more of a lukewarm, as if someone had left it sitting for 10 mins. i got the tacos with chorizo was dry and burnt. i didnt say anything at the time because i figured growing pains. but every other time after the food is always lukewarm, the coffee is hit or miss, and theres always a wait for 2 star food and service. i will go back to snooze but only in tempe. try tempe its better service and food.
extremely hard to find.  its located under an escalator at a deadend area of the casino.  unless you walk all the way to the front door of the venetian theater and turn around itll be behind you then you could easily spend 30 minutes searching for it like i did.  another reviewer said its near lux cafe...not really.  its a good bit away from it. the casino signs for it stop when youre still too far away to find it, and casino staff seemed not to have heard of it.  i asked two  one sent me to the lux cafe bakery; the other tried to send me to the restaurant, which is located on another floor.fairly pricy.service was average; staff let a drunk woman cut in front of me and said nothing about it.  they got my order wrong, but fortunately i checked my bag, and they did fix it when i asked.but the biggest reason for 2 stars: seriously underwhelming pastry.i ordered a macaron, tko thomas keller oreo, a bouchon, a croissant, and a mini almond loaf, and coffee.the only things i would have ordered again are the coffee not exceptional but good and the almond loaf, which was quite tasty if not ideally fresh.  the tko was decent but too sweet  that white chocolate ganache didnt blow me away.  im pretty damn sure that everything except possibly the tko was not baked that same day.i went around 11 am; perhaps things are betterfresher earlier?
this review is for the little bouchon located under the escalator near the theatre. i stopped by here 3 times during the course of my stay at the venetian.five stars for the pastries, but one star for the poor service. pastries: i tried the macaroons in salted caramel, coffee and pistachio and all were excellent. these are large, about 3x the size o a normal macaroon, and were perfectly gooey in the center and crunchy on the outside. i also trie a croissant, which was flaky and light.service: poor, sloppy, rude. my latte came out too hot and i could taste the burnt milk i used to be a barista so i know they steamed it way over 140 degrees. when i asked them to redo it, the guy rolled his eyes, didnt acknowledge me and handed it back to the barista. no apologies that my overly expensive 6 latte tasted shitty. also, they got my macaroon order wrong and i didnt find out till i flew home. bouchon is a prestigious brand, and im surprised theyd hire bratty little teenagers or people with the service level of a mcdonalds to represent their brand. no matter if its the flagship restaurant or a little express location like this one, bouchon should ensure consistency and quality in the experience of their brand.
tried one of the large raspberry macarons. it was subpar. it was crunchy and just didnt wow me. i had high hopes! :
eh, disorganized operation. the staff are all wonderful, but their pet boarding is another story. i called to make a reservation for pet boarding about a month before thanksgiving. asked the nice girl if they would be closing early the day before thanksgiving, or if normal drop off times were ok. she said that they would be open during normal business hours.  luckily we arrived at 2:30 that day to drop off the dogs because they closed at 2:00 and just still open due to some surgeries that were getting out a little later than expected.  would have been really upset and had some issues with our planned trip if we had gotten there a few minutes later. they didnt even call to confirm the reservation or to warn of closing earlier due to the holiday. strike 1. today is christmas eve and again i have reservations to drop my dogs off for a couple of nights.  confirmed this one during thanksgiving and was told they would be closing around 4:00, so to just bring them before closing time.  i just called 3:00 pm and was told that i was forwarded to their after hours answering service and to call back later because the office is closed. i asked what time they closed today, and was told 12:00pm. awesome.  thank goodness i was calling to cancel instead of just arriving to drop them off.  strike 2. the only reason its a 2 star vs 1 is because their staff is amazingly kind.  they are a very smiley bunch and i truly believe they want to be there caring for pets. they just need better systems management in place so if youre boarding, you are reminded of their closing times and provided accurate information at least 24 hours beforehand. will likely not go back for their 3rd strike.
rumor was that art of flavors closed. i was extremely bummed but i drove by the other day and saw the open sign lit up. rumor is half true unfortunately. the original gelato queen is gone. the nice lady that made all those incredible flavored gelatos is no longer the chef. apparently the arepas next door was affiliated with them but they ran into some business misunderstandings and they dissolved their partnership. the place is still up and running going through some new renovations but the gelato unfortunately is not the same. im sure i will give them a try once more but for now their gelato is no longer 1. stay tune for an updated review, maybe they improve as time goes by, for now my apologies art of flavors but ive experienced better.
this place is definitely not what i was expecting. from the pictures and the rave reviews, this place was disappointing. another review said this place is now under new ownership but kept the same name, which i believe is completely accurate. when looking into the display case, the gelato looks nothing like the pictures, its just regular gelato plopped in its container  no extra sprinkles, nuts, or garnishes to let you know the flavor.i tried a few of the favors: pistachio a goto all the time!!  didnt even taste like pistachio at allsweet corn: no flavor of corn, or any real flavor of anything cookies and crean: icy with black cookie specks but no cookies and cream flavorcappuccino: only decent flavor that actually tasted like coffeei ended up getting a scoop of the cappuccino and the bf went for the cookies and cream. after paying, the man behind the register said, ciao!. nothing against the new owners trying to create an italian vibe for a gelato store, but he was clearly hispanic he was speaking spanish to his coworker when we first came in and it all just felt like an imitation of what this place used to be.
i was told that new management took over a few months ago.  im just wondering what happened, and why?!  this place was kind of hard to find.  its on the southwest corner of las vegas blvd and wyoming.  the sign is small.  its between the arepa restaurant and a boutique.the photos of specialty flavors from yelp were definitely not on display today.  wheres the creme brulee gelato, birthday cake, lucky charms, almondpecan baklava, sticky toffee, and all these exquisite flavors that were once here?  i guess i missed the boat.  the display was just of your average flavors: espresso, pistachio, cookies and creme, hazelnut.  just plain and nothing fancy.  i sampled most of the display, but nothing really appeased me.  the girl behind the counter was trying to have me sample the whole display, which i wasnt a fan of.  i wanted to try what i want, and nothing more.  i decided to settle for the butter pecan.  it lacked flavor, but at least it had small pecan chunks.  it was not soft or creamy, nor was it set at the right temperature.  it was colder than most gelatos.  very mediocre at best. guess the original art of flavors is gone.  :c
ordered pork souvlaki and the mixed loose meat lambpork. very friendly service friendly delivery guy food was fresh but very bland and not flavorful. i wouldnt order again.
i was super excited to see a cafe opening on my street and waited with anticipation for its opening, peeking in the window every time i walked by, following their mysterious updates on social media.pros: very airy and bright, large tables, perfect for work or studying. desserts are made inhouse and are pretty good. there is a takeout window on the side of the building facing the sidewalk  bike path.cons: some of the food is  miss the vegetarian sandwich looks really unfortunate and beigebrown and liquidy. ive tried a handful of things from the menu and will stick to desserts. the opening hours are a bit odd for a cafe: opens at 8am during the week and kitchen closes at 4, sometimes they close early, ive been on a sunday and it was closed altogether though the sign in the window said they should be open.the major drawback for me is the service. ive been in this cafe at least a dozen times and the majority of the staff are so cold. ive brought friends and clients here and a couple of them have commented on the cold service. there is a new cashier in the evenings and he is much friendlier. also odd, my friend got their loyalty card on his first visit with me and ive yet to be offered one after going a few times a week since they opened. update 102015: the staff have demonstrated how unprofessional they are by sending me a pretty passive agressive message about my review without acknowledging that they are, you know, service providers, and i am or once was a client. no desire to come back to this place at all.
like the name, on relegue ca aux oubliettesfor those who dont speak french, basically, put it in the attic and forget it.a shame as the place is very spacious despite looking tiny from the outside. potential is there but it falls way too short. starting from the flavorless coffee to ok food. i mean, im fine with okdecent food as long as the coffee is worth it, thats the point of a coffee shop. on the other hand, bad coffee is not acceptable.lets talk coffee. while it was served hot, it didnt took too long to cool down which is perfectly fine. what is not fine is the taste. extremely bitter and thats pretty much it. i couldnt detect anything else besides the bitterness. the baked good that i got, a cheese cranberry scone, did cut the bitterness but it wasnt enough. as for the scone, it was salty from the cheese and the cranberry you get here and there added a sweetness but in the end, i had better scones.what to make of the place? theres a very good cafe nearby so im having a hard time recommending this one. one thing though, from their social media presence, the cakes do look good but is it a case of only looking good? for you to find out as im not really willing to. at least, not now.
il nest pas dans mon habitude dutiliser yelp pour faire de mauvais avis.mon experience dans ce cafe na pas ete mauvaise en soi. le decor est bien. la vue sur le canal est superbe. la terrasse est interessante. le service etait tres courtois. les tartes semblaient fraiches et appetissantes... il y a meme du stationnement gratuit juste a cote. jy suis entree bien contente de faire un detour par lachine afin dessayer leur nouveau petit cafe !mes points negatifs. le cafe netait vraiment mais vraiment pas appreciable. jai premierement commande un cortado au lait damande qui a caille dans mon verre car il a ete trop chauffe. jai retourne le verre pour la premiere fois de ma vie en me disant bah, ca arrive, cest pas grave, je vais juste en prendre un autre. je prend donc un espresso pas de probleme de lait donc. et voila quil nest pas meilleur, pire, il goute vraiment tres mauvais, watery, astringent, extremement amer. je nallais quand meme pas le retourner une 2e fois, je ne suis pas une cliente desagreable :p je suis simplement partie, decue car meme mon pain aux bananes etait sec... ils utilisent les cafes phil  sebastian, torrefacteur que japprecie generalement beaucoup car ils ont des produits qui permettent de faire de superbes cafes, mais malheureusement, meme les grains vendus en vrac avaient une date de torrefaction de plus dun mois le plus frais le mieux... un mois cest pas vraiment frais.bref, il nest pas difficile de juste ameliorer son cafe alors il ne faut pas cesser de croire en la reussite de ce cafe, toutefois comme je ne suis pas du quartier et quil y a beaucoup de bon cafes plus pres de chez moi, je ny retournerai plus. je les suivais sur facebook et javais hate dy aller je continuerai de les suivre car ils sont sympathiques ; ...
after hearing wonderful things about this chain, i was excited to see one opening so close.  finally got a chance to eat there.  maybe i was expecting too much.  ordered a cold hook and ladder.  everything was bland. no taste to the bread or the italian dressing.  even the onion was bland.  the pickle was good though.  guess ill talk to my friends and see what they order thats so delicious.
this was the first time ive had firehouse subs and i was thoroughly disappointed. made a pickup order for the italian sub. when i got home, maybe 10 minutes away the sub was extremely soggy. very bready and bland, not much of an italian taste. the meat was piled on high but all i could taste was the ham. ordered my sandwich no tomatoes with oil and vinegar and jalapenos. definitely missing the jalapenos and im unsure if the oil and vinegar was on the sandwich. online ordering was very easy and straightforward,but my sandwich was not done when i got there. i will try firehouse again but i recommend sticking to jimmy johns or jersey mikes!
ordered online but when we got there on a busy fri 6pm there was no one at the pickup register and quite a line at the order register. after standing at the pick up register i had to skip the line which is awkward...one kid working register was not enough. anyway subs were ready by then. the steak n cheese was ok but didnt seem toasty...was soggy by time we got home. didnt like the italian at all...ham too smokey for me, had no pepperoni and we got no pickle. our fav is still cousins subs!
placed a catering order for a business meeting and was very pleased how friendly the whole team was when i arrived to pick it up. two members even walked my order out to my car.  had to remind them of a few things missing before leaving.  returned back to work and learned that i was given the wrong gallon drink.  i returned to exchange it and as a result had to delay the start of my meeting.  very disappointed that i wasnt offered even a free cookie for my inconvenience.
not that great. not a big selection and the kimchi fries werent that great. the main dishes were so so and not many good side dishes. overall 2 stars for the good customer service.
ive been here at least 4 times only because it was delicious at first  i liked their donkatsu and kimchi stew. delicious combination! the last time i went, the donkatsu sauce changed completely and does not taste anything like any donkatsu sauce that ive tasted. disappointed and wont be coming here for donkatsu. on the bright side, their corn jeon is delicious. also, their seulong tang is delicious. my cousin got the ramen last time and i think they put cheese in the ramen. he said it was okay  probably not recommended.  i would recommend this place for certain dishes and hopefully the recipe does not change.
not sure if i shall try the 3rd time. ordered the beef hotpot 29 and ramen ricecake hotpot 16 add cheese 3 the second time. the beef hotpot was ok, but overly seasoned with soy sauce and sugar. i remember i had to drinks tons of water afterwards. second time went for a cheaper choice bearing in mind that sometimes price does not justify quality. however the ricecake hotpot was terrible...excessively spicy, sweet, and was undercooked. ramen and ricecake shall be softer imo.service was good and i heard many good words about this place. not sure if ill try again. still wanna give a shot though.
severely overrated place. their sugarcoated corn pancake topped with green onions was the most confusing appetizer id ever had. their side dishes lack variety and freshness, chicken cutlet from their bentos was awfully hard, and their dakbokkumtang was a disaster. i tried here because my favorite teacher was a friend of the manager, but sorry im not going there again. i get why people like it though; a good place to start if you have zero tolerance for the authentic savory korean flavor and all you need is an instagram photo of exotic food.
okay, so its only been a few weeks since they opened, but i had heard about them through an associate, and he said they were clearly better than their local competition.  i ate there yesterday and i think ill go back at some point, but im still not convinced on a few points.11:30am, two guys working.  one taking orders and doubling as grill assistant.  the other was, im assuming, the owner, who was on the grill. i only ordered a chicken souvlaki pita and the appetizer hummus and pita, so i qualify my review by saying i do need to try more of a sampling of their menu.  when i do, ill update my review.order taker was friendly and efficient, and greeted me with a smile.  he took my simple order and i told him it was to go.  he acknowledged.pros:  hummus was chunky, not smooth, which is how i prefer it.  i like chunky hummus, but thats just my preference.  im going to guess it was made inhouse.  i could taste the tahini sesame paste and im pleased with that.  hummus without tahini is hardly hummus at all, and is just sad.pita triangles were adequate in number for the size of the appetizer i didnt run out and they were soft and tasted freshly warmed.  olive oil on top and two kalamata olives completed the presentation.chicken souvlaki pita had some of the best tasting greek chicken ive ever had.  grilled to perfection, with large, juicy, wellseasoned marinated chunks of breast meat.  very good flavor!tzatziki was plentiful.lettuce, tomatoes, etc., were fresh and tasted fine.cons:  waited a long time for my to go order.  that is not a big deal, especially if they are cooking the food hot and fresh, which was the case.  grill person apologized for the long wait.while i was waiting, the order guy brought out the hummus appetizer i ordered and put it down in front of me on a plate.  when i politely reminded him it was a to go order, he said something about i thought you wanted the hummus here, and the chicken pita for takeout.  no.  when i ordered, i said i wanted it to go.  hmmmmm.so he took it back and gave it to me in a to go container, resting on a paper sandwich wrap, when my sandwich was ready.order taker also handles food when hes not taking an order.  99 of the time, he washes his hands before handling the food.  not 100, but i have to give it to him... hes almost there, and i appreciate that greatly!hummus was just okay, flavorwise.  i tasted the tahini, which is good, but it was pretty bland after that.  maybe thats their style, but a little roasted garlic, lemon juice, a dash of cayenne and a kicked up olive oil would make it better.  thats just my opinion.  pita is adequate, but wasnt anything i couldnt get from a supermarket.  i think an olive oil brush and some more time on the hot grill would help a lot.  give me slightly charred, toasty pita bread that is still soft in the middle and youve got me.the chicken souvlaki pita had greattasting chicken as i mentioned, but my last bite had a huge, honkin piece of gristle in it.  it ruined the sandwich for me.  im a home cook, and ive trimmed thousands of chicken breasts.  when youve trimmed your first 50, you pretty much know where 99.99 of the gristle is.  seriously.  im assuming they prep and trim their own chicken in the restaurant, so theres really no excuse for that.  its a deal killer for me.the tzatziki was plentiful, but runny, not thick.  it was hard to call it flavorful when it was so thin.  im guessing if it was thicker, the flavor of the cucumber, garlic and olive oil would come through better and give it a creamier, more luscious feel.  theyre very, very close, in my opinion.price:  i think their prices are on the high end, comparatively.  my chicken souvlaki pita was 6.25 with no sides make it a combo for only 2.95 more, for a total of 9.20, and the appetizer hummus  pita runs 4.50.  my bill was 10.75, before tax.  not ridiculous for fresh, hot food, but more than other places i like.under their dinners menu, you will find plates starting at 11.95 and topping out at 13.50.  then, below the heading dinners you read, add crumbled feta for 1.50.  what?  a greek dinner costing between 11.50 and 13.50 has an upcharge of 1.50 for crumbled feta?  seriously?like i said, i will mostlikely try them again, and try a wider range of options on their menu.  i think ill give them a bit more time to trim off the rough edges and the gristle, hopefully! before i visit a second time.a for effort.c for execution.
this is my first review here on yelp, ive been really hesitant to leave reviews because i can tend to be critical but i have to set record straight here after seeing all these positive high ratings on this place.i live in the neighborhood and am a sucker for local business owners and love to contribute to everything local but ive been here twice wanting to like this place cuz its so close to me but i was sadly disappointed.  my first visit i got the gyro which should be the staple of any greek joint and the avgolemono soup.  first the gyro, im not sure if im just used to portions at gyro spots on the east coast but what i got here was a joke..... everything was all chopped up and mixed together??? and very small amount of meat. im typically used to getting gyros with nice big shavings spilling out of the pita..... here you could take the whole pita and practically envelope the contents..... 4 big bites max and you are done. for the price, no fries just gyro its super weak.  next the soup...... rice not cooked, barely any chicken not worth the time, again poor execution.second visitchance i had people in town from back east itching for a greek salad, for some reason i came back..... i guess i wanted to give a local business a 2nd chance to impress.  so i went for the greek salad thinking how can you mess that up right?? well guess what the salad was more pitiful then the gyro..... first issue.... who charges 8 for a salad and uses mostly iceburg lettuce!! strike one, next there was shredded carrots in it, probaby from the prepak iceburg salad mix?? strike two....... lastly they put one chinsy little salad dressing in for the salad! what a joke.  others had ordered soup despite my warning, i tried that again..... very inconsistent to the soup i had, even less chicken.overall pricey for what you get, wont be back.... you can catch me being happy going a little farther for the guy up the street.
wow, why is our pizza taking over 30 min? wait, what? what do you mean you burnt our pizza?so...  if i wanted to wait this long for a pizza, i wouldve spent the extra  to get a real quality pizza.avoid this place at all cost.oh, and they ran out of crazy bread. manager compd our whole dinner. ill give you an extra star for that.
i dont even know where to start with this place. allegedly founded by awardwinning cake baker flora aghababyan, i walked in to a disappointingly meager selection and no evidence of the artistic flair she is known for and what is featured on the business website. local rumors are swirling that this spot isnt affiliated with her, hence their sudden name change. a few whole cakes and some bytheslice options were present no pastries, breads, or any other baked goods. perhaps i should have expected that, given the name, but the shop was quite bare.service is a joke. i came in and was stared at until i made a selection, the staff chattered away with one another in persian? and had difficulty ringing me up. when i mentioned the business name change, staff again started speaking to one another and i did not receive an answer. i sampled two cakes the bird cake and one whose description included coffee. each slice was around 3, and each was a bland, flavorless, dry mess. these cakes tasted days old.  the bee sting cake at german bread bakery is significantly better.as michael us review mentions, i snapped a photo of the exterior signage and the pastry case and received a harsh glare... before the staff began again, grumbling angrily in a foreign language.  unwelcoming doesnt even begin to cover the feeling of this place. note: yelp hours are incorrect, this business is closed sundays. not that it matters, because i cant see a reason to come here.
im not a big fan. ive been here three times, and only once did they have real honey boba two other times it was made with brown sugar or something  false advertisement. im giving it two stars because of their spectacular service. im not crazy about their drinks neither. ive tried their hokkaido tea my sister ordered it, avocado smoothie the best one but you have to pay an extra dollar if you want them to use an entire avocado, black tea latte, and thai milk tea.
its cool that they serve fresh vegan desserts. i had a slice of their vegan vanilla peach cake 3.50. it was the worst cake ive ever had on par with those giant sheet cakes served at kids ice skatinginflatableslaser tag birthday parties. this was my first time trying vegan cake, so perhaps what im about to write is a feature of all vegan cakes: the cake tasted stale, like a weird brick dense and fudgy instead of cakey. it tasted nothing like peach. the icing was overly sweet and tasted like the kind youd get on a walmart cake. you know what i mean that weird, powdered sugar taste... and smell... shudder. i felt nauseated after eating it.one huge gripe: the description specifically said that the cake was frosted. this is incorrect. the cake was iced. i hate icing. which was why i was so excited to have some frosted cake. icing is the nastiest thing that man has ever invented. never trust a baker that cant tell the difference between the two!ive also bought groceries here and at the old strawberry fields. still unbelievably overpriced. it felt like i was coming upon a new joke at each aisle. a pint of ice cream costs 7.29 without tax. a frozen pizza is about 14. a small bag of dried peas with enough peas to fill a sandwich ziploc bag was about 5 as well. peas are supposed to be cheap, yo. a package of cookies: 9. a small box of vegan chicken nuggets or a tiny bag of vegan meat tips: 15. one can of amys soup is 5. ive never seen amys products priced like this at anywhere but strawberry fields. the prices are marked up like hell. you can get some of these things cheaper at county market. its laughable. remarkable. fascinating. i only came here to get some meat alternatives i got two packs of vegan hot dogs for about 15, but i could never justify shopping here again for groceries or desserts. vegan food can be cheap. but not at strawberry fields. bumping one star though for carrying a good selection of vegan meatscheeses.
we were hoping for a great sandwich place but sadly this place isnt it. i know they just opened so hopefully theyll get better with time but im not sure well be willing to go back. person working the cash register was giving it her best shot but didnt really know what she was doing, and then the manager owner? came over to help her and confused things even more. once we ordered and sat down and noticed that there seemed to be like 15 teenagers working with one manager, and everyone seemed to be doing something, yet it took quite a while to get our sandwiches. youd think with that insane number of people working, food would be ready pretty quickly. when our sandwiches did arrive, both of them had this weird piece of soggy, crustless bread perched on top it looked a scrap of extra bread that was trimmed off some other sandwich. what the heck going on with that!? it was seriously just lying on top of both of our sandwiches when we unwrapped them and we had to peel them off! gross! i had the pompeii, which is supposedly their summer special. despite being doused in a watery mix of mayo and sweet chili sauce which made the whole thing super soggy, it had no flavor. i couldnt taste sweet chili or mayo its like the two just canceled each other out. the sandwich was also very short on toppings there was a decent amount of chicken, but hardly any veggies very disappointing. the husband had the quatro, which was better in that he could at least taste the flavor of the sauce, but it was still pretty lacking in the toppings department.  combined with the aforementioned soggy piece of bread on top, this sandwich was just mediocre at best.unless the place gets its act together in terms of service and quality of food, we will not be back.  too bad, because sun prairie is seriously lacking in decent sandwich places.
we tried this place for the first and last time tonight. the chili had hardly any meat or beans and was runny. the sandwiches were below standard small for twice as much money as other sub places.little to no taste in the neptune. the buffalo chicken sandwich had very little chicken and had a small clump of dough on top of it. charging for pickles is bad.too bad they cant be more customer friendly too considering they are new.
ordered sicilian style margarita pizza last night. ouch!!!  sauce and bread flavorless!!!  ive had better gas station pizza. however previously ordered calzone and philly steak sandwich and they were quite good
definitely not ny pizza. just because they were big slices doesnt make it ny style. pretty tasteless, super greasy, and 2 to add a topping is a little pricy. only tried the pizza but i wouldnt be back for it. i love pizza and when i have to force myself to eat a second slice so i dont feel like i completely threw my money away theres a problem. super nice people is why they get a second star.
when i heard about this place, i was eager to try the poutine, but now having tried it i am disappointed. 8  tax for a poutine...which is potato, gravy, and cheese.  for the portion and quality, drop the price to 5 and maybe it will be worthwhile.the only good part were the cheese curds.  the fries were a little burnt and the portion for the price was small.  the gravy was fine.
got a salad for lunch, the salad was small for the price.  also for such a small salad the service was slow.  for the same price jasons deli or energy cafe offers a much salad, double the quantity for the same price.  i will not be returning for that reason.service at the register was superb and the restaurant was clean so that was positive.
i wanted to love vdn, i really did.... around the corner from my house, right next to my gym, cheap prices.... what went wrong? i went in to get some pre workout, c4 to be exact... anyways the formula was changed back in january or there a bouts... when i last purchased it at this locations predecessor, freddies nutrition, i purchased the new 4th generation of the product.  i didnt even think twice when i picked it up off of vdns shelves... well when i got home what do you know? its the old version... i even checked the expiration dates... the one i bought today expires before the one i bought 3 months ago... not to mention that the product was hardened and beginning to clump..  definitely not stored in a cool and dry place they were great with giving out samples though... when i said that the product above was for my husband they were quick to try to find something for me... i told them i was looking to try something for recovery... bccas or something... however the guy gave me a pack of something that helps to boost testosterone... good thing i read the package as the first thing it says on the back is that it should only be taken by men!
its walk up style jack in the box type restaurant. so you get jack in the box service with the boca park prices. the food and margaritas were just okay and very pricey. definatly wouldnt recommend it.
theres nothing quite so disappointing as a drink that runs you 2 per sip. if i wanted a margarita that was mostly ice id have it blended. five mouthfuls from a ten dollar pint is nearly laughable. maybe if it were half price would i give this place three stars. subpar beans and rice in tiny portions only serve to make the nearly average tacos seem nice by comparison. the staff seems to be trying to make up for the shortcomings of this place, but its a shame it probably wont last long enough to make their training time worth it. their enthusiasm gives this place one star above the minimum.
heard about this place so decided to go to lunch on a monday afternoon. first when i walked in i stood there waiting for someone to say hi or even notice i was there but that did not happen. asked the lady standing there too if she could seat me and she laughed and said she was hoping i could do that as she was a customer too. finally saw the sign to go to the counter and headed that way. server at counter said hi then i asked her to explain this concept and she did. somewhat i got from her was basically this is a cafeteria  with a bar. you order from service counter then get a long stick with a number of  it and then go sit down. some drinks come from  the bar and some they give you before you leave the counter where you also pay before you leave there. sat at the bar and bartender served my beer then the counter person brought our food out on a tray and took long stick with number. really felt very cafeteria  style  and had ordered the steak nachos. not the worse i have had but then again not the best. while at bar i kept noticing how people kept walking in and just looking lost like i did. probably will not returned as the experience was not anything worth a second visit. the concept is not what i would describe friendly,  warm or even welcoming.
not really feeling this place. went for a friday happy hour. firstly, im not a fan of the order at the counter, well bring it to you thing. am i at a sit down restaurant or a cafe riochipotle? the menu felt confusing and was ridiculously limited. it basically is a chipotle with booze, except the food at chipotle is way better. i had the carnitas salad, which consisted of romaine lettuce, pickled onions, carnitas and some awful pork rind thingies. nothing particularly interesting, inventive or good about it. the food came quickly and the margarita was fine. another thing that bugged me was one of the giant tvs was tuned to a network evening news program. i dont know about you, but when i want drinks and fun evening out, seeing various dramastragedies being broadcast doesnt exactly add to my experience. this was a one and done for me, i wont be back.
though the name resonates with an upper middle aged crowd, this summerlin eatery falls short in many categories and is simply not worth the time or money. despite its rich long term history due to its namesake and original location, this restaurant seems like it just tries too hard to be hip and cool and ends up resembling something more like carls jr. but lacking the cheap eats value. when you enter, you are asked to order from a counter. then you can opt for full service where the waitstaff will supposedly check on you and refill your drinks. to opt for this service you must leave a cc at the counter to establish an open tab, regardless of whether or not you accrue additional charges. then once you order, you are given a number and told your food will be delivered to your table. how they know who is full service and who isnt i have no idea and it didnt really matter anyway as we left a cc with them yet not once did a waiter come by to offer refills or check on us. we left the table to refill our own drinks from the soda fountain and collect our cc prior to departure. the best value we experienced here was our lack of need to tip. overall, the only reason i gave a 2 star instead of 1 is i did enjoy the overall aesthetics. the kitschy 80s and 90s era toys like stay puft marshmallow man and peewee herman doll were nostalgic and cute. but when it comes to the food and service, stick to carls jr. at least when they deliver the food they usually ask if you need anything else. hussongs could learn a few things from them.
slow service.  no drink refills when we needed them.  only three tables with customers in the place.  food was okay and that is why they got two stars.
my family and i normally love this place up until this past friday night. i was lucky enough to come here prior to them opening to the public to sample and critique the cantina. i loved it! we have been here a minimum of 10 times since then. back to friday night and the 2 star rating! we get there at 9:00 pm, order our food, sit down outside, in a few minutes we get our food served by the gentleman from the kitchen. the waitress that was helping the other patrons outside literally blew us off completely.there are 2 other tables being occupied, the manager comes outside and greets the couple next to us and asks how their evening is and if everything is alright, they chat for about a minute. he then proceeds to pass our table and goes to the next table and asks them the same questions, they chat a little longer, wait.. here comes the big issue.. the manager looks at me and my group with a look of disgust, turns and walks back inside! wtf!! seriously?! we paid for our food like everyone else in this place, why not ask us, how our food is? i did not want to make a big deal because i dont want the girls to feel uncomfortable, but the manager continues to stare at us from inside, but never came out again. my husband had to go to the front counter to ask for a togo box and to refill our drinks. this is the first time i have ever felt so little in my life! need less to say we did not leave a tip and i felt horrible, but like my husband said, since we were invisible to the waitress, she got an invisible tip too! she did nothing for us, not one word to us for the hour we were there. i hate to tell my daughter that we will not be going back, because, us being mexican, we think the food is actually delicious. i dont fel comfortable returning. i was really hoping that is was not a racial issue we are a biracial family because this is the first time i had seen that certain manager and we were treated like crap.. but after reading some of the other reviews, they pick and choose who gets good service : i will not recommend this place to anyone again. good food, horrible service by those 2 who worked on 11615.
once was more than enough for me. this place is just weird. the seating is cheap and uncomfortable, the service is less than stellar, the decor was outdatedfelt like chotchkies from office space, and the food left much to be desired. the waitress got my friends order wrong. who would order dry enchiladas and better yet what waiter would not question an order like that? she spilt water on the table and decided to wipe it up with a dirty rag right next to my other friends meal. overall her attitude just felt shitty. all of the flavors were odd and disappointing. nothing i ordered mentioned cilantro yet it was found all over my meal. the fried avocado was heavy, oily, and just not good. caramel filled churros contained exactly zero caramel. the biggest disappointment was the street corn. it was easily the most bland street corn ive tried. the only reason i might find myself back there would be for the happy hour but im definitely in no rush.
stopped in for a quick lunch. everything from the selfserve salsa station to the tacos was just so so. in our group of 3, not one of us ordered anything that was note worthy. they do advertise specialty margaritas, which we didnt get to try. maybe thats what is boosting their ratings.
had to try waba grill after seeing all the good reviews!when we went in, the guy at the register was very friendly and shared some info about wabas meats and gave us some recommendations too, which was appreciated. i ordered the halfhalf bowl steak  chicken with white rice. they had 3 different tea choices and i went with the passion fruit black tea, which was good. tried a little coconut pineapple green tea too, which was also not bad.my first bite into the chicken i bit down on a hard piece of tendon. not a good way to start! i was hoping that would be the end of it, but there were at least a couple more tendony pieces in there that i had to spit out. and it wasnt just mine. my bf had some in his too. what a junky cut of meat! i dont know if they trim the meat back there or if it comes pretrimmed, but those people need to learn how to do it properly. i was also unimpressed with the steak as i really didnt like the heavy char on it was almost like eating charcoal at times and it had some inedible gristle as well... lost my appetite about halfway through. :i had such high hopes for waba, but i was very disappointed in the food. based on this experience, i would much rather go to yogis for a good teriyaki bowl.
a little disappointed i stopped by waba grill today for lunch. i thought i  would give waba grill a try after reading so many positive reviews.waba grill is  nice, clean and bright. i was  greeted as i entered the restaurant and the staff was very friendly. i placed my lunch order and sat down, and my entree was prepared quickly. on this visit i ordered a steak bowl with white rice and an ice tea.  i have to be honest my entree was not very good. the beef was tough, the rice was over cooked, and i did not particularly care for the sauce.i will probably revisit waba grill in the near future and maybe try a different entree and see how that is.
i was pretty excited to hear that there was a gastropub opening on monroe! its such a cute area that could use a bit more imaginative, creative food not that i dont love pizza brutta, gates  brovi, brasserie v, jacs, etc.this is not that place. dont get me wrong, it was perfectly okay. the menu contains what looks like fairly standard german fare. the soups sounded intriguing, but i ended up getting the jagerschnitzel pounded pork chop with spaetzle and cabbage. it was fine, if i was craving some sort of german meal, but the spatzele ive had at heritage positively blew this out of the water. i did like the mushrooms on top. my friends both got the chicken, which the waiter, sam, raved about. according to them, it was cold, and the flavor was just all right.other than that unhappy recommendation, the service was very pleasant and sam was helpful with the beer selections for the guys! they have a pretty extensive menu of what seems like a good variety of mildly unpronounceable german beers on tap 30?. since im not a huge fan of beer in general, i cant speak to it, but my friends said that they would come back for the beer if they were in the area, but not for the food. tl;dr: maybe this place hasnt hit its groove just yet, but so far, just get the beer.
freiburg gastropub is phenomenally amazing german food... provided youve never actually eaten any german food.  but other reviews here rave about the authentic tastes... if thats true, it makes me want to cry a little bit.i was so excited when i heard about its opening. my partner is a huge fan of germany. she even lived in freiburg!  our trip had all the makings of a warm fuzzy european reunion.  the decor is great!  beautiful photos of freiburg on the walls.  45 stars! the place was clean also brand new, so id hope so.  you cant go to a german restaurant and not order beer!  my partner ordered some powerful sounding beer: krackenholdenweisenfurter or something like that  and lets face it  all german beers sound incredible.  will it come in a stein, i asked ignorantly.  no it comes in an enormous glass!  you can use both hands to hold it.  wow!  exciting!  and then the beer arrived. um...  the waitperson sets down a tiny, little glass.  a tiny baby bunny of a glass.  more like a glassette. bigger than a shotglass, but falling far short of the expectation. maybe a juice glass?   ohwell, its just beer.  its not like wisconsin people care much for beer, right?  onward to the food!i ordered the doner kabob!  i grinned evilly. whats with the smile? she asked.  im gonna eat one of santas reindeer! i cackled.  eyeroll turns out, it wasnt santas lead reindeer on a stick.  it was, in theory, a german version of a greek gyro but with beef instead of lamb.  it arrived quickly and i dove in.  the pita was soft, warm, as youd guess.  the cucumber sauce and the cabbage were exactly what id expect from a greek restaurant  but wheres the beef?  i opened the pita and dug down past the cabbage, past the onion.  there at the very bottom was a tiny ... brown ... lumplike thing.  a dollop of brown playdo?  a piece of beef?  maaaaybe...  it tasted like beef.  my partners wurst platter was not the worst.  not the best.  middleoftheroad. you wont starve at freiburg, but you might leave hungry. maybe the management is going for a 1918s german famine sort of theme.  fortunately, there are plenty of other restaurants within close walking distance.  you can go to frieburg gastropub, say youve been there, and then grab some food somewhere else.if yelp let me use 12 stars, i might give it 2.5.  it really wasnt terrible.  it just didnt live up to the hype, and perhaps its my fault for dreaming itd be so much more.
i have to start by saying how much i want to love this place. however, we went at 8:45 for drinks and apps and we were met with almost a resistance to seat us. the staff was stacking chairs on the tables and eating throughout the restaurant as if it were after hours and it doesnt close till 10! i havent tried the food yet, but have to admit to not being all that excited to go back with that service... :
had a late dinner here shortly after the restaurant opened in july. as the grandson of german immigrants and a german history major who has traveled in that country and eaten a lot of german food, i really wanted to like this place; unfortunately, i did not. the interior is a cliche, like der rathskeller moved a couple miles to monroe street. the service was slow and uninformed, and the tables were a mess. german food is pretty tough to carry off in a restaurant serving urban american tastes, and this missed the mark. there were too many dishes using pretzels, and the menu was uninspired; coating trout in pretzel crumbs doesnt quite do it for me, and it just came off as awkward. i hope they can get their act together and breathe some creativity and inspiration into this place.
when you walk in to freiburg, it feels like you are walking into a set for a german themed movie.  the interior feels gimmicky and tries way too hard on being german.  and quite honestly, the same can be said about the food.  yes, they use german words for their entrees.  yes, they feature german beers.  but the execution of the dishes falls flat, real flat.  lets start with the beer.  i am impressed with the variety and options featured but not impressed with the glassware used.  yes, its branded to the beer you are drinking but their sizes are laughable.  if you have pub in your name, bust out the steins or maß glasses.for food, we ordered the kasesspatzle and the rinderbraten.  the former is basically freiburgs play on mac and cheese.  the spaetzle was gummy and came off oily.  the rinderbraten roast beef and gravy was ho hum.  the roast beef was not tough but not exactly fall apart tender.  gravy was fine.  but for 17.95, it didnt bring enough flavor or appeal to ever order again.i doubt i would venture back and i wonder how the monroe st. crowd will receive them in the long haul.  the area restaurants that have been successful have been ones that serve real and honest food and are authentic about who they are.  this cant be said about freiburg.
tried the wienerschnitzel.  more batter than pork not to mention it should be veal not pork.  very dry.  not good.red cabbage overcooked and bland.beers were great.  come here for beer, not food.
