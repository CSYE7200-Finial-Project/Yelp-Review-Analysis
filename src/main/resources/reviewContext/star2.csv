after waiting for almost 30 minutes to trade in an old phone part of the buy back program, our customer service rep incorrectly processed the transaction. this led to us waiting another 30 minutes for him to correct it. dont visit this store if you want pleasant or good service.
very disappointed in the customer service. we ordered reubens  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. they charged us 3.00 for the coleslaw. we will not be back . the iced tea is also terrible tasting.
i will start by saying we have a nice new deck. that is where the good part ends.why two stars if we have a nice deck now? well, it all started in may when we had a man named al come out and talk to us about the process. he was a true salesman, ill tell you that. not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... and we bought into it.he told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by june 24th. mind you, this was the end of may we met with him. he said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from dormont before they started. we felt confident in going with them, and booked it.heres where things fell apart. weeks went by with no word from them on the process. finally i called and left messages. al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. he must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. so i hung up not knowing what was going on. finally i called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. i wish al would have told us that.so our june 24th date came and went. we finally got our survey. and they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. i called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. apparently they were now waiting for the permit from dormont.a month later, i was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. i spoke with someone who told me that dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. he told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. i completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? just call me and tell me theyre waiting for the permit, but theyll work towards asking dormont what the hold up is. seems simple.finally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from dormont on holes theyre digging. so holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. where did everyone go? who knows, because i wasnt informed! i was upset and contacted the company owner, dave, by email. i told him how frustrated i was about the lack of communication. he wrote me two sentences that  said there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow. well, that didnt happen.then two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. the main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. so apparently the part about how they wouldnt need access to my house changes to theyre drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. finally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. it was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasnt cleaned up. i even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didnt use, and they only filled up one. when you create a construction project, isnt it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? didnt happen here.my main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. why be that company? why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? my main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. i understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. its not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.even though i have a nice deck after i clean things up myself!, i would not recommend them to anyone.
hoofah.
average run of the mill store.  associates are young teens and they really dont know where anything is.  luckily i am able to get around to find everything.  found my puppy treats and moved on.
real talk: i took my car through the carwash here once, got a nasty gouge down the side, and the guy at the counter didnt seem to care. the car wash has since been decommissioned, which is totally ok because the getgo carwash across the street is excellent and better in every way.
two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, i was compelled to write. rocky would definitely describe the experiences.on the first trip, i went to try their at that timeraved about reuben. and yet to find a true good reuben in da burgh, i tried it.well, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their raved about reubens, i received two minireubens, which basically took the guts from one reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. i ate it. it wasnt great, but they swore it was because theyd run out of the bread. bread or not, it still wasnt great. the atmosphere was pleasant in that blue collar bar kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the reuben.the second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen tv covering the sports of the moment.i was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. my friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.we hit the salad bar, which was uberbasic. three soups mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out, basic iceberg lettuce mix very probably out of a bag, a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. it was a basic salad, no big deal. more or less an appetizer filler before the meal.the mindblower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when i placed my order. i asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. it literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to ask, and the child honestly had no clue what white meat and dark meat meant. the first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a preportioned prepared bag, kind of kentucky fried chicken style...which didnt answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. after the second trip back i heard the cook holler tell him ill fix him up. well, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like youd find in the freezer case of walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chemspuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green parsley?, and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.thank goodness for the basic salad bar.even my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what shed expected. they also appeared to be from a freezer bag.the irony was that the boy who didnt know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. ahhhh da burgh.third base? nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. just dont go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.from what i understand it used to be really good homecooked food. but apparently, mama has left the kitchen.
we came here once before and remember it not being very good, but figured wed give it another shot since its pretty close to our home. its still just ok. we didnt have to wait this time saturday morning at 10:30, but there was a wait throughout the time we were there. the menu is very basic no specialty pancakes, waffles, or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette. there were no meal options, so if you want home fries or something, its extra. the omelettes do include toast. great bread, btw! we had to wait a while for our food, which was surprising because weve been to a lot of diners. my husband and i both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg. its almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over. as for my mushroom and cheese omelette, the cheese was lacking. my biggest peev about this place is that its cash only. perhaps i missed it, but im pretty sure this wasnt noted anywhere on the menu or the front door. thankfully, we had enough to cover our bill, buts not a good way to end the meal when youre scrambling and digging for change. there are a lot of good diners in the area, so i doubt well be going back.
my first time going to barbs country junction and i really wanted to like this place, i really did...however, i didnt.the food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. i got pancakes, bacon and eggs. the pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. my son had a burger and it was good. the coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. i would give the food 35.the service was subpar for sure. while our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasnt on top of anything at all. had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. she got the order messed up and so on. i give the service 25.the inside of the place had some country charm as youd expect but want particularly cleanly. it also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. a customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. i give the interior 25.the prices were decent. i fed my whole family breakfast 3 of us for 23. i give the prices 35.so in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. there are better diners in the area that i will patronize in the future rather than barbs.
it looks so much better in here since they changed from paddys to rileys. its a shame, however, that they had to keep that same curmudgeon of a bartender that ruins the experience. can somebody notify me once they get rid of him?
okay, so hopefully you havent been enjoying happy hour  rileys pour house before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting irish owners. to recap: murphys pour house from 19791985. sullivans pour house from 19952002. paddys pour house from 20022012. and, bagpipe please, rileys pour house opens march 1 of 2012. still with me?its a tiny long bar just like the old irish pubs. no more smoking allowed. hurrah!!!  same lousy service. my guess is that the entire place needs no, strike that .... demands an automated foodbeverage ticketing system. none of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. its actually pretty funny if youre not a hungry or b thirsty. i really really want this place to do better. we need more irish pubs and local old time watering holes. get it together, murphys ... er, i mean sullivans....er, i mean paddys or is it rileys? ;  .  whatever the case, they have cold guinness. and irish music.  and fun patrons.
i love ljs, but i  had to write a review regarding this particular location.  the inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for.  it smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door.  it took about 15 mins for the food, so i figured it was gonna be all fresh...negative!  the fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft.  the corn lacked butter.i didnt care for the onion rings and my boyfriend said the coleslaw tasted spoiled.the chicken planks and hushpuppies were the only things edible.  service wasnt too bad  nice people.  too bad a whole bunch of flies started flying around the dining area and prep area, which ruined my appetite.
far away from real chinese food. doesnt even taste good as american style chinese food.
i used to order takeout here once every month or so. the food tastes average and the price is good. its your typical lowend chinese place. the last and final time i ordered here i just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. while i was waiting on my food which took much longer than usual the inspector was pointing out violations. he also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. the inspector looked at me like i was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  as for the rest of the place  its always been kind of dirty inside. the carpets are just filthy and the walls match. there are always childrens toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. the workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness don don is lacking.
i bought a three month membership last year, mainly to attend the silver sneakers classes. i was in my early sixties and hadnt exercised in a while. i tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so i tried a morning class for seniors. i like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so i went to the tail end of a yoga class. the women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that i wasnt welcome to stretch out in their class. i never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. i didnt feel welcome here. i complained to the manager, who said that i was welcome to stretch out in whatever class i wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident. do they think that this is their private gym?
i have to say that i write this review with much regret, because i have always loved papa js. but my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. from the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didnt know the menu. as i said before, ive been to papa js a good handful of times so i know the menu decently well, but the server couldnt explain any of the questions i had about a couple new dishes i was thinking about trying. i swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.but it wasnt just the knowledge of the menu. it was one thing after another with our server. my wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it at which point the meal was over, so we didnt care at that point.  i mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? there was no one filling up water.my biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. my dad and i both ordered the trout special trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat. instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. not what the special was at all.  and by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server which, we are sure it was or the chef, who knows for certain. not to mention, though, that a good server wouldnt have served us that regardless. but before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. when we informed our server of the mistake, he didnt really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. at this point, the meal had been sitting because it took us forever to flag this guy down again so the trout was basically cold. the server then said he would have the meals remade. so, he took the meals back to the kitchen. meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and i are sitting there with no meals. also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda yes, believe that or not. all the kitchen did was scrape their mistake off of our fish! they didnt remake anything. our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. quite frankly, the fish wasnt good at all. i honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from mcdonalds that night. the server never did anything to try to make our experience better  he knew we werent happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. im not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. the guy never really even apologized for the mistake. normally, i may have asked for a manager, but at this point i was ready to just get out of there plus, we had to be somewhere else that night.my opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants i would rather eat at.
coming here you get the feeling they havent changed much.  the tables, the decorations, the menu.  all the same.  does that make you a little worried?  yes.i ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  very very oily.  the actual ravioli was okay, enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  did i mention that?  ambiance, like i said, left much to be desired.  i dont think id have this place on my list of musts for downtown.  much better restaurants to visit!
service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are just working . they have nice decor,nice bar and good bread. consider where this place is ,the prices are really really high . nothing is served on the side with main dishes ....
although the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience. our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room, right by a door where clinking pots pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal, as well as a darth vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent. our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered.  dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree the waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price 6.99 which brought the salad up to 10.99 ! outrageous !there is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant , but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere. i will most likely not return. very overpriced for the quality and service.
papa js is expensive and inconsistent.  the ambiance is nice but it doesnt justify the prices.  there are better restaurants in carnegie.
man has this place gone down hill.  my husband and i went a couple of weeks ago.  we had salads and pasta.  both were on the verge of inedible.  with a single glass of wine, i felt downright robbed at the 50 price tag.  seriously, i could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. classico is better.  and the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didnt want to deal with it.  seriously, id rather eat at the og.
once upon a time, papa js was a great place to eat. great food and knowledgeable wait staff.unfortunately, after a couple of very unsatisfactory meals we will not be going back. looking for a great italian meal? look elsewhere.
our pizza was cold and our drinks where empty.  we are not going back.!  the waitress started as attentive, but slowly slipped away to the point where things became frustrating.
i struggle to write this review simply because this dining experience confused me. first, the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown carnegies main street. when you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with desserts and amazing looking house made breads. it rather looks like a deli counter. you have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area. a bit confusing layout, but tastefully done. the dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant. it felt much more upscale once in the dining area, but i did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique. the food  a wide range of italian dishes and seafood. we ordered the crab hozel as an appetizer. it was an average serving of lump crab meat, i had to ask for cocktail sauce. it was tasty, but cost us 18. we then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggies like artichokes, eggplant, peppers, etc. there were 4 smaller sized cutlets of veal and 3 shrimp. 28. there was no salad or pasta side offered. the dish was prepared properly and was ok. we just felt it needed something else. now the bread that was offered to our table came in a small basket and was filled with a variety of their house made breads. the pepperoni bread was amazing! i mean really delish. this alone i would have given 5 stars. the service  our server was...well....im not sure what he was quite frankly. annoying?confused? hyper?  he appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time. bouncing around the table, asking the same questions over and over, forgetful, spastic, etc. at one point one of my colleagues said, is he on crack? we chuckled, but seriously! he forgot to even ask us if we wanted dessert, which was too bad because we saw some amazing looking offerings in the cases as we were leaving.overall  if i were in the area again i would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go, as they do sell it by the loaves. however, i think i would try somewhere else to dine.
ok a few things. first we walked in and asked for a table and was told it would be 5 mins. so after 10 mins, we were seated and there was 10 tables that were open! why the hell was there a wait??? the older man that took us to the table could have done nicer. the bread was great and that was about it. the food was not bad but it was not good.
i wrote a letter to the papa js, but did not receive a reply therefore i will share my experience online.tonight a friend and i dined at your location. we were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk, which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials. our server took our order of a gingerale, fried zucchini appetizer, side salad, wedding soup , eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata  correct spelling.we thoroughly enjoyed the bread  wedding soup.the side salad was rather bland and unexciting, lacking flavor  texture. the spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce, a single slice of tomato and one black olive. i would have expected some additions such as onions, peppers, cheese, cucumbers, croutons, carrots and the like.   we enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer, but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal, so we asked the server  bartender  about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to put it in. he offered to put it in at this point, but advised us that our meals would be out soon. we decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to.    the main dishes were acceptable, not outstanding. the eggplant was very tasty and well prepared.  the chicken piccata was flavorful, but not as expected.the chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked. it had no signs of being coated and sauteed  to a rich golden brown. the chicken was just pale white.the sauce was a simple lemon flavor, it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken. i tasted no garlic or shallots. the sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers, which were absent.  no pasta was served with the chicken. the side of vegetables were well cooked, buy again lacked any real flavor. the would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars.  once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another 20 minutes for the check. the server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers. the total was 43 and change.i would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order, but no such offer was made and i saw no manager come around and check on the customers, as is customary.i am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience.  i hope this feedback will be beneficial to your business.
typical starbucks coffee chain. 2 things i dont like about this starbucks: 1. ive been there twice and both times the place has been dirty, compared to the other starbucks i have been in.2. if you have to use the bathroom, they give you a key thats attached to this nasty bottle. im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly.aside from that, good coffee and fastfriendly service.
if there was ever a get your coffee and go starbucks, this is it. right in the center of the waterfront, this starbucks has no sofa, comfy chairs, only table seating. i love the baristas here, but i dont like the location of the building.
this starbucks is teenytiny!seating inside is very limited.  this is a starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the waterfront.baristas are friendly and fast.
im not a huge fan of this location. i think that it was oddly built the small, alleylike front makes it difficult to get past people on your way tofrom the bathroom or tables when its busy. and theres hardly any tables to sit at. furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult especially in the winter weather. the staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time i was there. and the coffee that i had was cold im sure it was probably the bottom of the batch. id probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area.
this particular starbucks was especially pushy with offering extra espresso shots when placing my order. this has never happened before and it took me off guard.  the barista came off dishonest and unfriendly with the up sell push.  i will avoid this one at the waterfront for awhile.
for someone who straddles the line between sometimes crafter, this store can seem vast and confusing.  theres rows and rows of baskets and bedazzling jewels and paper and...oh my...scrap booking!  when i want to find boring old felt....its like...where do i start?  im in a hurry, as always, and i rush in and the first thing i look for is an employee.  no one to be found.  i could call out and my voice would come echoing back.  i run between rows of paper, wood and gosh darn scrap booking....no felt!  where do i find felt!  where do i find an employee!?finally, i find one after 15 minutes of wondering around.  shes incredibly nice and leads me to the felt.  this is not the first time ive been hard up to find help.  i tell her she was hard to find, and she tells me that theyre low on payroll and cant have any one the floor but her!  in that whole store, just her!  thats ridic!not a month ago i was, again, in a slight hurry and stood in line for about 15 minutes to check out, with 2 employees at the register and 6 people per line, i gave up and walked out.  hey michael, do you pick up what im putting down?  youre not making any money because your costumer service sucks....in fact, theres no service to be found!
the one good thing i can say about michaels is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. theyve got items for woodwork, painting, knitting, kids crafts, scrapbooks, you name it. the problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal. theyve got lots of cool items all over the store that youre convinced that somehow you need. because it is soooo cute, and you could totally do something with it. right..? the store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. however, if youre looking for something specific, good luck. its not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. its that when you find the right section, theres either nothing in stock, or they simply dont even carry what you need. i stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. i ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. plus the prices at michaels are significantly more than other area craft stores. i usually only stop there if im already at tend waterfront. id recommend checking other craft stores first. unless you need glitter. especially fine glitter. michaels has the best glitter selectionquality of any store ive ever been to.
well... as steak n shake locations go, this isnt the best one aroundbut it is burgers and fries that are open 247.the milkshakes are good!pros: always made fresh, when you order;cons:greasy but its burgers;takes longer than typical in drive thru but thats bc theyre made fresh!;service on a scale of 110, 10 being awesome is a 4.
in general i do like shake n steak, but this location is a hit or miss location!  you never know what kind of quality or service youre going to find here.  a friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there ever!  you cant entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire place...poor scheduling on the managers part. however, while she cant be accountable for the slooooow service, she was accountable for both orders being incorrect.  the burgers were over cooked and the fries were soggie and the milkshake was runny at best...by far my worst visit to steak n shake!
rather typical sns.  had a good lunch crowd.  milkshake was good but not as good as enp down the street.  it took to long to get the burger for some reason, 25 minutes, i realized cooked to order but this is a little long for sns.  ordered the guacamole steakburger and it only had a small portion of gauc...not your usual amount..kitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason.  definitely did not look like the picture on the website.  oh well!
this place is s l o w....like so slow i have got up and left after waiting 30 minutes and not even being acknowledged by a server. the food is okay. def not worth the wait. milkshakes are just okay as well. booooooo.
i really like the chili. burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad. pretty hard to mess up a side salad. as others have said you never know what kind of service you will get. store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair. the staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude. all in all what you pay is what you get. cheap and crap service.
the food is good. unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. the main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and its pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints.
this place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star review.  ive had pretty good experiences inside, its usually the drivethru where things fall a part.  its the rare place i can get a frisco melt well, the only place i can get a frisco melt!  and that steak burger alone is worth the risk, walk in or drive thru.just take a gun on weekends, youll be fine.
its okay. food is cheap but portions are small. for example i order the chicken tenders, and i got 3 little tiny tenders, and a decent amount of fries. also the restaurant is not really clean either.  this restaurant is not my number 1 choice.
i like to eat here because the food has always been good and kids eat free on the weekends which is great. but this location is always woefully understaffed, with five or six tables sitting unbussed while people wait to be seated. whether youre inside or at the drive through the wait is incredibly long. fortunately the staff are always friendly despite the ridiculous staffing levels the management maintains here.
slow service. food is very cheap though. the milkshakes are huge thick and yummy. sometimes when i go here, they completely ignore you when your the only person in line. the burgers were good and the menu is pretty small. food takes about an hour to come when no ones even there! i would go here if the service was faster and better.
another store which has gone the way of the dodo bird. actually there was nothing basement like about it. what will be done with the empty space that is the question?
9.75 for a red bull and vodka? im sorry, i thought i was in pittsburgh, not new york city. sing sing, a dueling piano bar, is fun, but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if i could have more than one watered down drink before i warbled my way through paradise city with the rest of the crowd.
in my opinion, sing sing is really not worth it. it gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put 5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put 10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. i wasnt really into it when i first got there but as the night went on and lager went in i started to warm up to the place. i feel that if i have to drink in order to have a good time, its not worth it. but again, thats just me.the 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the rock bottom brews they serve.
this place has gone significantly down hill.  ive gone to sing sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  when we started going there you couldnt get a seat unless you got there early.  it was always packed.  however, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  i was there last saturday night 8412 and there was about 2030 people there.  very slow and boring.  it appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  this was likely my last time at sing sing.  save your 7 and skip this place.  a real shame because this place was once a lot of fun.
i went here with a bachelorette party. we had reservations, which was good because it was packed that saturday night. the performers were very talented, but the acoustics were strangely off.   the theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, you bitch, you slut, you whore and  twinkle twinkle little slut, why dont you take it up the butt which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... you get the idea?  perhaps if i had not been the designated driver, alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth, sixth, seventh time. or maybe not.
this place is overrated. a friend and i were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. theres nothing wrong with this place i just dont understand the clout around it. there should be no clout.
theres lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place, but the food was average at best.  we were there on a pens playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  our orders were somewhat mixed up.  the potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  i tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  the crust was delicious and homemade.  if you are going to order something, i would go with the pizza.  we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also.  if you are looking for good food, homestead better choices at blue dust or tin front.
ive been to dukes three times now. when i first came to pgh, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.they have an excellent new tap system. last time i went, they had thirsty dog leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. the system really elevates already awesome beer. plus, the selection is awesome. it is a sportsthemed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud tvs and plenty of yelling. im sort of into that, so it doesnt bother me, although i do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. service is often slow, and they give the waitresses zero training in the beers that they offer. this is not a good place for trying something new, as they cant tell you a thing about it. the biggest downfall of dukes, though, is the food. ive had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; a burger, a cheesesteak and chicken tenders. the first was flavorless and cold. the second was passable, but nothing special. and the last were absolutely awful. honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, i had to call it an early night. i ate two of the 7 tenders seven! and had to quit. their fries are very good. and so are the wings.id say dukes is a good place to drink, but thats about it.
db is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy. they are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. you feel a bit milked afterwards. also much fatter.you pay for games using credits from magstripe cards. this lets db give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. menus for drinks and food have no prices. 6.05 for a banana split cocktail? 3.40 for a michelob?  i have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology like anchors and so forth.waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.the games are all violent shooters or racing games dont appear to have changed much since 2002 when i last went to db in california. hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.not a pleasant experience, but at least its different from going to an ordinary restaurant.
think chuck e. cheese for adults.  skee ball, video games pool tables.  clean environment.  good fun.unfortunately, i went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  i ended up settling for spinach dip.  sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  blahhhh.  trying to get something healthy, i ordered the apple pecan salad.  i swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  i could barely eat the salad.  too sweet.my mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  the steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried again!  yowzer!  artery clogger for sure.  i like the atmosphere.  i like the bar area.  perhaps next time well just stop by for drinks instead.
dave and busters is an enigma, is it dining, a bar, or  playground for video game lovers? let me get the bar part out of the way first, its overpriced, and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill. next, the food. just like all the chain places at the waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesnt? pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. the games, i swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. i guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.overall dave and busters is unique to the waterfront, but its time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century.
not much of a review for this one, but just a few tidbits of info...pool on fridaysaturday is 14 per hourim pretty sure its 10 through the weekmixed drinks are way too pricey for the location.the food is crap.the games are fun and the pool tables are nice theyre the big tournament stylesize, not the shitty barroom, tiny pool tables.that is all.  :the pricing is based on my recent trip.we shot pool for a few hours, i had a bar tab that wasnt out of control and my night ended up costing me 60
when did dave and busters become a daycare?? everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6pm on a saturday. i couldnt even walk through the place without someone shoving me. ahhh!i get that dave and busters is an arcade and that youre going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. when i last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while im sure we got into some shenanigans, i dont remember children running wild there. we were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. this time, it was ridiculous. it isnt chuck e. cheese, yet thats how parents seem to be treating the place.on top of that, the customer service sucked. the place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a saturday at 6pm, the hostess told us after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. i suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until youre table is ready, but the food at dave and busters is not worth a three hour wait on any day.the hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. next, i engaged in the most rudest thing ive ever done i began stalking tables where people were finishing up. i would walk up to people paying their check, ask if i could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and i should get in line.finally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. it wasnt because we ordered a lot of food it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. he seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. after that, he seemed to come around a lot less. i had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. the fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. for 14, it wasnt worth it. after dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. all in all, i didnt like my experience at dave and busters. i remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, cant recommend this place. if anyone asks me to go back, i may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.
not being from the area, i traveled an hour to come here from uniontown, pa. i was excited! i havent been to this dave and busters since i was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! i went with my cousins, mind you, we hadnt ate all day and were very hungry. so, we decided to do the eat  play combo, naturally. heres where it gets bad. first of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. her name was ashley. we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. she said shed come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. mind you, our food still hasnt came yet. i see other people getting their food that had come in after us. i was frustrated. after waiting 45 mins for our food, i asked to speak with a manager. one of the servers who i asked replied rudely with well, hes really busy right now. i doubt hell be able to come out and talk to you. finally, 15 mins later...thats one hour, folks. we get our food. what do you think the next problem was? yep, the food was cold. i was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed i was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. the manager never came to speak with me, and we didnt even receive our meals for free. the only compensation we got were 10 game cards. wooptydoo. the only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. so, in conclusion...i do not recommend the waterfront dave and busters of homestead, pa. it was horrible, and i will not be returning for a very long time!
my boyfriend and i are in our 20s, and have visited this db multiple times. after our visit yesterday, however, i dont think well be back. when we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. at first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! the girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. we stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. it was a saturday! after we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. it took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. the floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! i had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms i used have no toilet paper in them, but there was tp all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. my boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didnt work. all i have to say is get your crap together. we could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on saturday compared to what it used to be, and im i have no doubt its due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. for how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. its a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will not be returning anytime soon!
ok! let me tell you about my bad experience first. i went to db last night for a post wedding party  which, side note, is a great idea!it was around midnight and the bar wasnt really populated. there were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. the two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. kind of counter productive if you ask me. i stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when i am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. i made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. i finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  i was standing right in front of them smiling and they didnt ask if i need anything. i finally said, are you working? and they gave each other a weird look. i felt like i was the crazy one. i asked for a beergot the beer.in between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. she took a fry from the plate right in front of me and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. what the hell! i felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks  not an established db. i was just really turned off from that experience. the good is that db provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. i remember going here with my grandparents when i was a kid and it was the best treat ever! we would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. this place holds some really good memories for me. its a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards i held for it.
i used to love db when it first opened in the waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. the games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. it takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! the atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games fruit ninja and 3d experience rides. with such games, you cant even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! last time i went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. i would go to db to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.
i recently stopped there with my girlfriend and her kids to celebrate her daughters 21s birthday. i ordered the fish and chips. dont order the fish and chips unless you want to lube your insides for months. i know i probably got the one that got away and they refried it 3 times. the outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste. the fish itself was bland. after a few bites i called over the waiter who was very nice and funny and complained by showing him how hard the fish was by tapping the fish against the plate making a loud thud noise. he grabbed my plate and took it to his manager. but before doing so asked if i wanted something else i said no i had lost my appetite. the manager came out looked around and walked right out of the area. i was thinking he would have stopped but didnt oh well. the waiter took my meal it off the bill. i have eaten there before and the food was good. sometime you just get one that isnt.
my sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together. this place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms. all of the food looked great on the 16 page menu. when our food came though, everything was below average. they have a huge selection of games for the kids to play, but you pay dearly to play games here. the food is  overpriced and the drinks are drastically overpriced.
4 stars for the fun factory, games, and all around experience, but 2 stars for the disgusting food and horrible service!i was so excited to come here for my boyfriends birthday. its always fun to play games, win tickets, and have fun with friendsfamily. we decided to eat here before we played. i keep seeing commercials for their new menu, so hey it couldnt be bad right? wrong! only thing that was really good was the coronarita  but thats hard to mess up. first off, service was horrible. i didnt feel like any of the areas were that packed to make the service so slow, but apparently i was wrong. it took about 15 minutes, minimum, to get our first drinks. at least an hour for our food. i have boneless buffalo wings, which are hard to screw up, so mine werent bad but they werent the best. my boyfriend had their philly cheesesteak and he couldnt finish it. was so salty and just not good. for the price of everything, it was not worth it all. better off going somewhere else in the waterfront for food and then coming here to play. youll save , time, and frustration! i guess they are also remodeling their price area so for now there is a makeshift area to cash in your tickets. everything was pretty picked over, which kinda sucked. overall it was still fun, and i am sure i will be back to play some more games!
can we get a maintenance man?  and a janitor?  and a manager?   no?  ok...i had a good time at dave and busters, but that was based mainly on the company i kept and not the venue.   we went right when they opened for the day, with the intention of playing some pool.  we located the pool tables in an area that looked closed off, so we went to the hostess stand to ask.  she radioed for help, got none, and finally went in search of an answer our question.  when she came back, she said she couldnt find anyone, but a manager would be out to talk to us.   we wait...and wait...and finally just give up and go off to play in the arcade area.   all but one of the card purchase machines were rebooting, and the one we could use didnt work.  it takes forever and finally gives up and directs us to a nonexistent ticketing attendant.  so we again go off in search of someone to help.  we flagged down a server, who issued us a card 56 for 375 tokens and served us a few cocktails average prices, though my rum and coke was teeny.   and we are off to play some games.  about every third game we tried was broken in some way.  either the token swipe didnt work or the game itself was messed up.   it also wasnt the cleanest place ive ever seen.  they have tables around the place to set your drinks on, but most of them didnt look as though theyd been wiped from the day before which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all day.overall, they appeared completely unprepared for opening computers booting, employees not ready to work, soda gun at the bar not assembled, etc. and not well maintained or managed at all.  the broken games were sort of comical after a while, but definitely not in a good way.  if you are really looking to do this type of activity, id try a different location for sure.
over priced, over hyped but a hell of a time regardless.  i think if you have a big screen tv at home and a wii you could order pizza get beer and have friends over and have the same experience without the price and glitz.  ive yet to eat something here that impressed me.  the arcade is a bit dated but i like playing the big trivia game more than anything again, you could just invite people over to play trivial pursuit.  the new tv set up is pretty cool, but dave and busters is just what it is, an adult chuckie cheese not worth more than a visit a year, if that.
i ate here for lunch today with my wife and 2 kids. server was prompt getting to the table, took our order and then disappeared. our food took 25 minutes yet there was only 4 table with people who were dining. grilled cheese, salad and a quesadilla shouldnt take that long. games were fine. mens room didnt have any paper towels to dry hands with. huge fail for this type of venue.
i have been to dave and busters multiple times and i feel its a 2 star place.i can say the food quality is sub par.  in my opinion the food prices are expensive for what it is and quality.  they do offer a nice bar,but then again the prices in my opinion are a little higher.  service isnt too bad, but could be better.db is a great place for adults for sure, but the prices for tokes or game play is a little ridiculous.  some games charge 6.9 credits to place.  thats almost saying 1.50 a game and some of those games are addicting where i know most of us keep playing.  i also thing db isnt the cleanest place either.  the bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion.  doesnt seem like they keep up with it.  to me, thats a big factor in rating restaurants.   all in all, db is an ok place to visit, but not a place i would frequently waste my money.
the food here is awful.  i came with a small group of people for dinner one night before heading out bar hopping at a few places at the waterfront.  we gave the server the benefit of the doubt because there were about 8 of us, which can be challenging.  i think the long wait time to get the drinks and then the food was due to the bartender and kitchen, but the waitress really tried her best.i only gave it 2 stars because i liked my mac and cheese.  everyone else at the table hated their food.  they all had sandwiches or other dishes.  the one girl resorted to eating only the toppings off her sandwich because the bread was too hard to bite through.  the kitchen probably made her sandwich right away and left it under the heating lamps for 40 minutes while preparing the rest of our tables food.i was tempted to stop and play games for a couple minutes, but after my husband came out of the restroom he told me how about 5 other guys walked out of the restroom as well that had not washed their hands and immediately went over to start playing games.  all i have to say is no thanks.
the food was good but we waited an hour for our drinks then 1.5 hours food then an hour for our bill. wont be back! not busy at all so not sure what the problem was. id hate to be there when they are busy.
eh i was disappointed. the food wasnt so good and the place had a weird smell to it. at least the waitress was pleasant. probably wont be returning anytime soon unless they make some changes
summary:if i was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, i might come back for beer and appetizers.good: decent beer... original pretzel appetizer.  you take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip. huge portions.  most of us had leftovers.  the rb appetizer sampler was multistory and way more food that we could handle.  the half order of ribs looked like a full rack. attentive service with quick seating and frequent drinkwater refills. amusing name.bad: lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  i guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no ones awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place. none of the food was super awesome.  nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  ive had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries. kind of dead on a monday night with 34 of the place empty.come if you want bar food, but keep your expectations low.
microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when theyre better than the beer i would have drank otherwise.  one waitress i had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as kind of like coors light.  if i wanted coors, ill pay half as much and have one.  the food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  head next door to sing sing for drinks, though.
lately, the rock bottom is hit or miss. the beers are always good and the uppity jagoff ipa is one of the best india pale ales ive ever tasted. the low point lately has been the food. i will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. that said, i ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. the filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. i suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the rock bottom.
i always feel like i am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, i feel the bar is raised for places like this. it seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. unfortunately rock bottom is one that falls into that category. lets be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. if it was only about the beer, id go buy a growler and take it home. so, about the beer....excellent!!!!! the jagoff ipa is with out a doubt one of the best ipas i have ever had! they only i can think of that i think is better is dogfish head, but thats a matter of opinion. the beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. you cant go wrong, theres bound to be a beer everyone will like. as for the food.......its pretty much a crap shoot. sometimes its good, sometimes its terrible. my biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. one time its perfect, then maybe its cold, or its burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. thats pretty much it. this place fixes its food consistency, and its a five star place. till then, its hit or miss!
i must admit, i do like the brews.  i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  other than that, meh.  the food is pretty forgettable.  another brewery that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  with the restaurants upping the ante on 8th ave, you may want to kick it up a notch rock bottom.  but how would anyone know to?  its a chain.  whomp whomp!
i went to rock bottom this past weekend, and it was nice to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. while the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isnt good and the food is average, at best.it was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking theyd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didnt work either. if we hadnt really wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at the improv, we wouldve just left. it definitely wasnt busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so i cant overlook it. of course, the service has always been spotty at rock bottom, so it was hardly surprising.combine the weak food and poor service with rock bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula thats kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.
slow servicebelow average food ill pass
rock bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just ok.  the restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. they have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. i have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. their food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. i have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really werent anything to write home about.i feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but i would probably describe them as the chilis of brew pubs. if you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the burgatory opens!
went here last night to meet folks for a friends birthday party. docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise id be fine giving this place a 3.our waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall  i had a plain ol burger and a delicious berry sangria  and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...youd think this would just be another average place notgreatbutnotbad and id be ready to go on to the next review right there.heres where i ran into problems. id checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since i do my best to pick items on menus that arent, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when i asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that its a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didnt recommend it. then why tell us on your website that youll do it??? additionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurants ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. obviously whatever error occurred wasnt the waiters fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had. on a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; ive started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that i get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.final verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the foods nice enough. i was admittedly left a little underwhelmed.
so after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the waterfront, we headed to rock bottom for some late night grub.  the place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  as nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  so finally seated i look over the drinks and being the huge ipa lover that i am i went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  the hubby had the red ale which was also rather good.the service was ok, not the best not the worst.  but moving on to more important thing, the food.  talk about missing the mark hugely!  i ordered the mini street fish tacos.  you get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  they were just strokes away from inedible.  i love fish tacos, i mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? the shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when i picked them up.  the sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  if i wasnt so hungry i wouldnt have eaten them at all! lesson learn on that.the husband had the bbq chicken pizza.  it had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  my husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizzas and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  for instance, he would usually just say, chicken bbq and cheese, nothing else!  i refused to let him do that this time, because i was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  and boy was i jealous when it came out.  it blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  should have stuck with something simple.  furthermore i could care less if i come back to this location.  the beers were good but hell you can get a decent ipa just about anywhere anymore.  and the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  i know this is a chain, but it still doesnt have to stink...
the food is standard american farea bit overpriced in my mindand the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  the kolsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  the service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long generally 2030 minutes even for just beer and apps.  ive been to the one at the denver airport as well, but i was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okaybutnothingspecial pizza from rock bottom it was.  since its a recognizable national chain, i think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true pittsburgh craftbrew experience.
the beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at all. ive tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a foodie palate, dont even bother, because you will be very disappointed. if you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch which, nothing wrong with that! you will most likely enjoy rockbottom. the only entree i did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas minus the repulsive beans and rice and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. otherwise, you are better off skipping it.
for this occasion i was with my girls, we were looking for a place to have a good lunch.  we looked around and chose rock bottom, we have eaten then before and enjoyed ourselves.  the server was a very nice person and was very attentive.  she when over the specials and took our drink order.   going through the menu one thing that caught my eye was the bbq brisket stuffed burger.  that just sounded so good.  unfortunately the reality didnt match the idea of the burger.  the favor of the bbq never came through and the smoked gouda flavor was none existent. it was like having a standard old boring burger.  i was very disappointed.  for 14, i would have expected a lot more flavor.  i would not recommend this burger unless they do something to bunch up the flavor.
overpriced. food is ok, but way overpriced. quantities are small....much smaller than the picture in the menu. the beer is average. but yes, you guessed it, thats overpriced too.
was hoping for a great end of a day experience, but...... things happen. waitress seemed to have forgotten about us, entrees came out prior to our appetizers. entree of fish chips was a major disappointment, fish was soggy and the chips were cold and grainy.starters were comped but i doubt wed go back. sad because it has the potential to be a home run hitter. two stars and thats it.
rock bottom: a cautionary yelpers tale.you might say, ive never heard of rock bottom, theres no way that they are a chain restaurant. beer? apps? bros? sounds like a good time, but be careful or youll end up on the rock bottom.after a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a buffalo wild wings, we were finally seated. we could feel the tension from other diners that something wasnt right. the manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps. we immediately ordered a few apps but just like got, and now our watch begins.we waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. the food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary. the only reason why i am giving them 2 stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20 of our meal due to the terrible service. so if you have decided to take a seat at rock bottom, take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain.
while this is certainly not my first meal at rock bottom, this is my first meal in a year or two . the wait was minuscule, and the greeter was pleasant. as always it is a haircut weekend so the twin carnivores, the mother in law and i decided to tie the feed bag on at rb. our server matt was easy to work with and informative. i started off with the tortilla soup. spicy and thick it went down easy enough. however let me say that the price at 3.50 was rather steep for the serving size. did somebody say ouch!! thing one and thing two each had the small fry steaks  with fruit cantaloupe, melons, and grapes and steamed broccoli and at 6.75 each, i think i was buffaloed if  you get my drift. the steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of .... hmmm. they say that kids say the darnedest things well thing one noticed that his steak was very very gristly, and thing two noticed that his was rather dry. not the best dinner they have eaten. they say you get what you pay for or not!!  my meal consisted of the chicken bacon mac  cheese  and at 14.75 i had no complaints. it was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon. how can anything be wrong with that much bacon!!! the final dinner consisted of chicken fried chicken and at 13.95 my mother in law was sated. over all this meal was a wash. if anyone from rock bottom corporate reads this... you may seriously want to rethink you portion sizes. as you know i vote with my feet and dollars, and neither will be there again any time soon!!
this is another one of my favorite places that had deteriorated dramatically. corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck. the menu has gone from something for everyone to a couple of overpriced entrees and a bunch of small plates that are ok but not great. the service has also suffered tremendously. we are abandoning this restaurant.i dont expect this rock bottom to be around too much longer.  in the past, on nights when the pirates were playing out of town, the bar and the restaurant would be packed.  last night, it was only slightly busy.  you can usually tell when an eatery is suffering by the amount of staff on a given night and the conditions of the bathroom.  the staff was overwhelmed and the bathrooms were filthy and in serious need of repairs.  alas, i dont think that rock bottom will still be in business in six months.  hopefully, if that happens, black rock bar  steak house will find its way into pittsburgh.
stopped in for dinner an bellied up to the bar. the bar tender was quick to get me a beer the 3 pepper ale which was really good but after that i was totally ignored. tried to get the attention of the two bartenders for about a half hour while nursing my beer. they seemed to be more interested in changing dollars for quarters and washing glasses. i got feed up, finished my beer, paid my tab and went to unos. glad i did... got great service and my meal came quickly.verdict:  sit at the bar for a beer if thats what you want but if youre hungry and want dinner take your chances at a table.
service is good, staff is friendly and knowledgeable. beer and cocktails are good as well. food...not so much.  my boyfriend and i shared the jalapeno pretzel appetizer which was pretty good, but our entrees.... disappointing.  i got the baja chicken sandwich and he got the bison burger.   both were super dry. i could not even finish half of mine. he had to drench his in ketchup to be able to get the bison burger down. if i were to go back, it certainly would not be to eat.
meh is the only thing i leave here feeling.  i ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me.  for a side,  i requested the seasonal veggies trying to be healthier and was told its a squash mixture  great i love summer squash!  i received a poorly seasoned burger. the bun had the most flavor which is a sad statement.  it was topped with an olive and a mini pickle... odd.  my squash side was lacking squash. instead all squash was replaced by peppers... which i cannot eat.our server was nice.  the beer was simple.  with new breweries and restaurants popping up in and around homestead, perhaps rb should reconsider their flavors.
overpriced. food is ok, but way overpriced. quantities are small....much smaller than the picture in the menu. the beer is average. butbyes
the place does what it does best  comedy.  the food, however.  blah.first off, if you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  this means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are required to choose two items each.    second, the sodas are not free refills!  i learned that one the hard way.  get water. third, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasnt already taken her cut out.  even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many diet cokes, i thought that my bill was rather high.  upon further inspection, i noticed that my server had taken an 18 gratuity.  the menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we werent even drunk.  i found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18 even though i typically tip well over 20.    overall, i dont like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  i can see why they do it, but if i were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time i went to the movies, i would be far less inclined to go as i am not inclined to go to the improv again.
the pittsburgh improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution some specific examples at the end.the setup is nice, a delightfulif a bit sterilereproduction of what youd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough tv.  the interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and its an ok atmosphere to see a show and laugh.its too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for pittsburgh comedy.  most of the big names that have recently come through pittsburghjim gaffigan, louis ck, second cityall perform elsewhere though they managed to get bob saget, to their credit.but the biggest problem is the food and drink.  theyre very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  the prices are well above what id consider reasonable given the quality, and id begrudginglyor even happilyjust shrug off the cost the same way i would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  youre forced to either a buy extremely overpriced drinks 3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refillsor ten dollars for one with refills, or b buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldnt want in the first place.  i thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in i decided id rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.still, i think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.a few specific drawbacks which could be very easily fixed:1  a lot of the drinks didnt have prices on them.  i know this isnt uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own showviewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, its an incredibly poor decision here.  make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  its not that hard.2  put the drink prices on the website too.  an improv representative has personally responded to many of these yelp reviews, and she once said our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!  im calling shenanigans.  not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.3  reminding me to tip my server during the show and adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like youre trying to trick me.  its kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to ones customers.4  since the 3.50 soft drinks dont come with free refills, the servers shouldnt ask would you like a refill on that? or anything of the sort.  they should ask would you like another one? instead.  they should also respond to requests for refills by saying we dont offer refills, but id be happy to get you another one.  just because theres a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesnt mean people all figure it out.  most patrons dont even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere like a cola or diet cola, and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.
my husband and i went to do something fun. the comedy was great!  the food, however, is mediocre at best. in addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. i could not see a thing. when we received our check, they had added an 18 gratuity without permission or notification.  i will not be returning anytime soon.
we came to the improv for the first time on friday night for my wifes work holiday party. we arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozenthenthawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. i took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and i can tell you it was downright tragic. dinner arrived and since there wasnt any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. it was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. it looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. the pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pureed canned tomatoes. i saw traces of onion in my dish but didnt taste them at all. i was so hungry that i salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. yuck. i didnt make a dent in this crapfest. for dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which i ordered. the chocolate cake had freezer burn. inexcusable! it wasnt edible. the cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. i know people arent coming here for the food, but if you are forcing them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements two drinktwo menu item minimum then at least make some halfway decent food. it doesnt even have to be memorable...just not offensive. which it was!! had i paid for any of this i would have made a huge stink, but i tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. the comedians were good. the venue was niceish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our event. not always the best thing in a comedy club we only got picked on a little bit. but damn, i was hungry! i found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy waterfront restaurants and how id rather be there...how id rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how id rather have a giant bowl of captain crunch...how id rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.my car was also violated in the parking lot. i had an adorable german license plate on the front of my adorable german car which was stolen while i was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face i wanted when finally retreating to my car. i feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.the improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. i truly believe thats the only thing that can save this place. do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. well, two i guess. other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so id steer clear of those. unless there is a cant miss type of comedian here, i cant ever picture going back to the improv. id give the comedians 4 stars, and the food zero stars.
so...we got here and seated by 635pm. orders placed. drinks served. now it is 752pm. one of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich. i hadmy shrimp diablo. it was as described. spicy and good!!! but hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. we also sent an order of chicken fingers back...dryer than sand. and my fiances chicken caesar salad chicken was as dry as the chicken fingers. barely edible, in fact, she didnt eat more than 3 pieces of it. upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better.
its sad that this the only place locally to see national comedy acts other than the big uns in the cultural district. i hate this places m.o. the space itself is fine...only a few blind spots, nice intimate venue. they bring decent acts in, although they have a lot of repeats and need to bring in more new acts. but the two item minimum just infuriates me. overpriced, shitty food and drinks. we went to see lachlan patterson last night hilarious show, very nice guy, signed our cd and posed for photos with people. we dropped 40 on a chicken quesadilla, 6 hot wings, and 2 yuengling drafts. the whole time i just sit there thinking about all the amazing places i could have eaten for 40. burgatory is right down the street. hell, tgi fridays would have been better. ive been to other comedy places in other cities and they often have minimums but everything is either a lot cheaper or a lot better quality.  the improvs saving grace is that they often have free or very cheap tickets.
let me preface this by saying, i generally compare all grocery stores to publix, maybe even kroger. that being said, the one thing giant eagle ge has going for it is the quality and selection of items. there is no question that it has everything you could want. thats where the praise ends. lets just do this numerically...1. prices are outrageous. if you walk 100 yards over to the target next to it, youll find some of the same items for 3040 cheaper. a bag of gevalia coffee is 7.99 at ge, the same coffee at target is 4.99. and its not just coffee, and not just target. giant eagle has little other grocer competition in pittsburgh. this being the case, if youre not near an aldis, target or walmart, you have to go to ge for stuff. theyre banking on this lack of competition. 2. parking lots are thrashed every day, all the time. now, maybe you dont care. but when i go in the morning, theyve been open maybe 30 minutes and there are shopping carts littering the parking lot and the sidewalk in front of the building. they clearly dont bring them in at the end of the night. they also rarely have any small baskets near the door, youll need to hunt for one. its just laziness and a lack of care, on both accounts. they dont care about the appearance of the outside, nor the convenience for the customers. 3. i dont normally mind the selfcheckout, but only if i have a limited number of items. if i need a full grocery order, im going to have to wait in line for one of the two cashiers working the registers, on a saturday. the lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious. im already paying exorbitant prices, but i also have to ring up and bag my cart full of groceries too? walmart doesnt even make you do that!so thats about it. if you dont mind paying much higher than average grocery prices, ringing and bagging your cart full of groceries and generally being an afterthought as a customer, than giant eagle in waterfront is awesome!
barnes  noble, its like the walmart of bookstores.  beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike.  im not quite sure whether im in a cafe, at a newspaper stand, a book store, a cd shop, a movie house or a flea market sometimes.  with all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge its a bit hard to figure it out.  feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee.i dont know about yall, but id rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this.
i stopped here yesterday with rob and matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing the hangover at loews across the street.  incidentally, the hangover is one of the funniest movies ive seen in years and worth the 10 to see it in the theater.  okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  there are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  its spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  we sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  i ordered a guinness as usual, rob ordered a long island iced tea and matt had a miller light.  make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else youll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  i sampled robs long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  the next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  the bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  i dont remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  we ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  we started with the chips and salsa.  the chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  i tried one it was okay i guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  he asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  this pretty much sums up my experiences at the bar louies ive been too.  they kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  maybe im being too critical... i tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... so, i settled on the hummus appetizer.  this was surprisingly pretty good.  the pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  its probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  matt had the hot wings which i tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  all in all this place isnt that bad.  if you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and youre more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.
i had the exact same experience as john r. went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. the place was near empty and there were three waitresses. got seated and waited on immediately. ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. this should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. she said our food would be out in a few minutes. another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. we flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. she finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. she says she didnt even realize our food hadnt arrived well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didnt. after speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she definitely put our order in so it must have been given to someone else by mistake. because they wouldnt have noticed that that wasnt what they ordered? seriously?the waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. all that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. how generous! we shovelled what we could into our mouths, did not leave a tip thankfully, we didnt have the added gratuity that john had, and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. worst part? i opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. of course.however, i gave this place two stars instead of one. thats because my food, when i finally got it, was perfect. i had the greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how i like it, with delicious toppings. i really wish i could come back here for the food but...hell no.
let me just say that this used to be a place i loved.remember when youd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months youd go back and have it all again? well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you cant describe and the place is no longer familiar. to me, that is bar louiei cant say the food is bad. i had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. i will say i still ate them so shame on me. my  sandwich the mario as always was very good.now here comes the bad:1. there were fruit flies everywhere. i felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. at one point i had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. i understand that the establishment is an indooroutdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.2. the place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. the girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.3. because of number two our service in general was not good. i cant totally blame the girl she did the best we could. i mean. ive played diner dash on my ipad, i know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.its sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. i think im being very generous by giving it two stars but because i used to love it so much i cant rate it that low. part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father itll just let me down again.
this is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. friends and i went here for happy hour starting at 5pm. they claimed to have 1 draft, 5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. when we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. we ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. i only had appetizers here so i cant really judge them for their entrees, but i will rate according to my eatingdrinking experience.  i got the spinach artichoke dip. it was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. for a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. i dont know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...i felt like i was chewing grass. overall, i would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. food was way too average for the high price.
i am normally a bar louie fan  my husband and i love the one in tampa.  this location needs a lot of work.  we went on a friday evening before a show at the improv.  we were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  we never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  we got there at about 6:406:45 so happy hour was wrapping up, but i would say that the bar was not even 34 full.  there were also plenty of empty tables.  this should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  but we grabbed a table.  i am not a clock watcher, so i am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 57 minutes.  then we got our drinks at 7:04.  the only reason that i know is because i was looking at my phone because my husband and i wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of happy hour.  that went out the window.  when our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  we finished them and left.  the server was nice, that is not the issue.  the issue was how grossly understaffed they were.  they had two bartenders on i think and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  the server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped.  that is a sign that you need more staff.  i have never had this happen at any other bar before.  get more staff.  we ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get hh pricing.  even though, in my opinion, they should have honored hh pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:507:55.  we ended up going to the improv and got food there.  bar louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.
the food was okay. the noise levelwith 10 people in a huge roomdeafening. awful acoustics!
eh, this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowdoverall experience for a saturday night.bobby and i came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. when we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5 minutes in our original seats. it wasnt all that busy, either. most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. it seems that bar louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decorneon blue lightingextensive martini list. maybe im just salty about the wait.
really the only thing good about this place is the happy hour. no one wants to pay 8 for a glass of wine that is a short pour and bottom quality.
i dont frequent bar louie, and i really dont plan to change that any time soon. ive eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and i just havent been super impressed by the place.the food has been decent  a few years back i splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that i am  but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never wowed me. and while i enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that i think most of the drinks i personally like dont qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. once i stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me 10 here. not even a large one, either! sorry, but i find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since theres cheaper places to get drinks in the area.still, the food and drinks are definitely aok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind if i could hear myself think when i eat here. but good lord, theyre just so loud! i always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. not cool, bar louie. not cool.so while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places  and given the other options we have at the waterfront i dont expect to be back in any time soon.
food was 7 out of 10 for this type of bar  restaurant. service was extremely poor and bar service was also extremely poor. untrained and understaffed bartenders will keep me from coming back. no reason to not be able to get a drink when sitting at the bar.
good drink new old fashionedfood was so so shrimp tempura app, but service was not good and i think it may have been amateur night in the kitchen. food took a long time to arrive for a simple fried appetizer  approx. 20 mins. with zero acknowledgment from my bartender.  shrimp were cooked well, but sauces were extremely salty  sweet to be paired with tempura batter.  the bar is drafty and customers other than me were complaining with no noticeable change. im not staying for a main course
i wanna love bar louie, i do. it seems like even on the deadest of nights it takes 20 minutes or more for a waitress to even show up at our table and get a drink order from us. the food is good, but the past 3 or 4 times ive come theyve been out of tater tots by 9 pm, and im always told after my order is put in and the kitchen decides its now time to tell the wait staff theyre out of something. it may be time to start frequenting a different location besides the one on the waterfront.
i absolutely love the ambiance of this place. the bar area is very large, and there is even some upstairs seating with nice couches and whatnot. a solid beer selection at reasonable prices makes you want to come back! it doesnt generally get very crowded even on friday and saturday nights, so dont expect a south side type of environment. all that being said, there is a reason why this is a twostar review. even though this place doesnt get crowded, it takes a very long time to get served. i have waited up to 30 minutes between rounds while sitting at a relatively empty bar.
i only go here when i cant get into burgatory and because i enjoy the outdoor area with the firepit which is a pretty cool atmosphere.  their really unhealthy food options like the loaded fries or loaded tots are pretty good, but their healthier food options are really lacking.  i tried to get the blackened fish tacos and the fish was really dry and overcooked and of poor quality.  the tortillas were completely stale and hard and had large gashes down the middle.  they have a decent beer selection but when i asked what their seasonal great lakes on tap was they said the christmas ale its the last week in april now. i knew that if i ordered that draft it would be quite stale as its probably been in there for 6 months now, so i got a southern tier instead which was good.  the service is ok but rather slow.  overall im pretty underwhelmed by this place.
the evites are in the mail for the 2 for 99 special! you will have to spend 24 on a parking pass. i signed up last year for this promotion and dont think i got the passes worth. the waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day. there are just too many misses in my book though.1st off all traffic is a biatch! be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. next remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place. im not a mean kid hater my experiences have been bad at the sandbar pool. if you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that will push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they wont use them because they run around the park all day. i actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid. i was like im an adult and you need to have some respect. he pushed me and took all the chairs. i only needed one and his mother did not correct him. i was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because i moved the chairs over...that no one was even there to sit in at the time. damn! for real!sandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak. plus they are so sugary. if you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes. an adult area would change all this. i dont even care that im getting splashed all the time i do realize that im at a pool but its hard to relax.if you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go. if youre trying to go on the weekend forget it! the weekdays are bad enough. im looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer.
its fun, but not as fun as kennywood. the boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that makes for a lot of shoes onshoes off events. the lazy river could be much better. i did like the water slides and the potato patch fries, as well as the scenic location.
i have the season pass and go atleast once a week and each time ive been in the last week ive been.disappointed. two weeks ago they threw a rubber baby in the wave pool and entice panic and claimed iy was a training exercise. disgusted. and today twice the pool with mushroom and waterfall in it was shut down due to adults pooping in the pool or puking dont know cant get a strait answer from any of employees. just sad there customer service sucks.
this was my first time back in about 12 years.  i havent been here since high school so its hard for me to compare 12 years ago to now.  i do know the prices have gone up but i can remember paying 19.  i think the best thing you can do is purchase the tickets at giant eagle or even looking on the sandcastle website for deals.  my sister for a deal for 19.99 and day in the 2015 season.  i  paid 26.99 at my local giant eagle.  thats not really a big deal.  i am definetly shocked that there was a 6 or 12 fee to park.. i mean its ridiculous we have to pay what we pay to get in and another fee to park is crazy.  we opted for the 12 fee to park real close to the entrance bc of having a 7 year old with us.  it is worth that extra 6.  i learned that you should get there and line up at the game fairly early if you want a good spot by the pool... people with plow you over and run to get a prime spot.  that is a downfall.  plus this means that there are a lot of rude people.  we got there early enough to ride all the rides we needed too.  we didnt do the lay river however because the lines were ridiculous.  the wave pool was a hit for my son but just watch all the people there.  people are rude there as well.  some horse play and such. i must comment on the food, i def love potato patch fries but the prices are crazy... i ordered 2 chicken tender meals with fries and the costed me around 35 with drinks.  thats is bs.  sandcastle is an ok place to visit, but its just not worth the money
fried rice super bland.chicken was slimy.service was indifferent. no repeat visit for me.
meh, ive experienced better is an understatement.fridays is like the fine dining chain for every yinzer in pittsburgh...1.  when we were seated, it was quick which was a surprise.  somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why.  i was happy about that.2.  i ordered one of their skinny margaritas, blackberry to be exact.  it was a nice size, however, at 6.00pop, that was half of my food bill.3.  the waitress started off attentive, but after our food came out she was gone.  i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  loaded mashed potato on the side because i wanted heartburn ha!4.  food came.  my burger had lettuce on it only.  waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  i had to wait to ask for my pickle.5.  the loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what i was expecting.  disappointment.6.  the waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check.  never again will i eat at fridays.  i will, however, go should a happy hour arise...
this place.. is ok if ur grabn something quick .. but they do have a great happy hour tho
im not opposed to chain restaurants but this tgi fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the chain expectation. i order the jack daniels chicken and shrimp with just fries. the fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. the shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. the chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. even the water tasted weird.fortunately, we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly. id recommend the tgi fridays out in south hills village over this one any day.
i had a gift card so i decided to use it for a to go order. the food tasted frozen and microwaved. nothing special just around average!
went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner. the server was very friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed. maybe they were short handed.  the food was to me not even average. i ordered a burger, which very overdone and dry. had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it.  my friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle, then put cheese and one jalapeno slice on each piece. imagine 6 halfmoons of taco shell.  not like any nachos ive ever seen, and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them.
i understand its a chain, and pretty standardized everywhere you go, but i found this location to be especially bad. first, when you walk in the restaurant has a very stale grease smell that permeates throughout the restaurant, nothing visibly dirty, but smells like the entire joint needs degreased. second, the service, the host was a typical younger girl, efficient without too much professionalism, not a big deal. the waitress, a professional , but unfortunately not in the way of experienced great service, but moreso as experienced in efficiently moving things along.  our food took a long time, and she saved herself by telling us that she didnt know why our food wasnt ready yet, but would check again, and of course, hot plates with lukewarm food came out soon after. she reeked of cigarette smoke, so im going to make a dumb assumption and guess thats where she was.  the food, typical tgifridays food, good enough, for a chain restaurant.  extremely unlikely that id return.
fridays seems to have gone down hill. i was quite surprised when we went and there want a wait. i thought we had lucked out. we were seated quickly and our server came over quickly. there was only one other table that had people in the section we were in. i ordered a jack daniels burgercooked medium. our food came quickly. my burger was well done and dry. without the jack daniels sauce there was no flavor at all.  the fries were pretty good.i was sad to see how far down the quality of food had gone.  thankfully our server did a nice job.
i dont care what cub and bulls fans think, this steeler and penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that. first, the crust tastes like a biscuit, and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza. i will give unos a thumbs up on its flatbread, its better pizza than some pizzerias in the area. when i look over unos menu almost nothing excites me, this place is a dud. guess what? chicagoans dont know how to eat hot dogs either!
i really dont know why i bother with chain restaurants anymore.  now that my palate has matured and i no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, i really cant find anything to eat in a place like this.  my husband and i were running errands at the waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  we decided on uno because pizza sounded good to us.  my husband is a meat lover, so i agreed to let him order us a meatcovered pizza.  to counteract this a little, i ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so wed at least have some vegetables in the mix.  when the salad arrived, it did not look like the picture.  the menu description is thus: chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.  this description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate drizzling of balsamic syrup.  it looks light and yummy.what we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, completely drenched in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  it was disgusting.  there was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  i suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about 10.  10 for complete inedible slop.  the numero uno pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  it was ok... very mediocre.  the crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  i have been to chicago many times, had real chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesnt even come close to the real thing.  the only positive i give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  it would be better if theyd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  they are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  im sure theres still a lot of room for improvement, however.  if youre listening, uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food  not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers lowfat cheese, lowsugar sauce, less sodium, etc..   their hearts will applaud you.  and lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement i dont know about?  its baffling.
i really love deep dish pizza. the thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. the spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. the mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. that being said, i really dont understand why people go to pizzeria uno. this chain has done to the deep dish pizza what mcdonalds has done to hamburgers, pizza hut has done to pan pizza, dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and taco bell has done to texmex; it has made it almost unpalatable. on our menu:french onionchicken bitespizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romanolooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. dont get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza i have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good. i really never want to return.
food was ok had a steak w shrimp side ass mashed potatoes. everything was ok not a lot of flavor.
pizza ok on its own nothing great . definitely not worth the restaurant price.  definitely not like pizzeria uno in chicago. are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark.
the menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive. for 2 personal pizzas the size of pizza hut 2 beers and 2 salads, we paid over 50 bucks. the personal pizzas alone were 11 each... if you want pizza and beer go somewhere elsepasta appetizers, or sandwiches... this place is good.
was very disappointed with the food. it was overcooked and not seasoned very well
nice place but some of the items on the menu are not available unless you get a 2 for 12 but thats not what the online menu states. and its a salad come on..
the only reason to come here is because its a fun place to eat. it sure isnt the food. too much dressing in a salad that didnt even fill the bowl. like so many before it, unos is making me leave hungry. it was a salad with walnuts, goat cheese, and blueberries, and while it was good, there was absolutely no value in this meal. one of these days i will learn to stop eating at big chain restaurants, kind of like not shopping at big box stores. its a nice atmosphere and generally crowded and loud. some would call it fun and i think it is. but, sometimes its worth a little extra to get what you really want and need in a meal. thats what adds value. in the future these places will be relegated to the last ditch effort when nothing else is available. only in a pinch.
redo!i went to pf changs several years ago and was not pleased with the food that was presented to me.  my issue: i thought i was getting chinese food.  my resolution: try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented american food with names of those chinese dishes i actually like to eat.so we returned to pf changs for lunch to try this american food in this caricature of a chinese restaurant.  there were very few people in the restaurant.  the two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  when our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:coca colaiced teapan fried pork dumplingssesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soupchangs chicken with white riceour drinks and my soup came out immediately.  unfortunately i was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before i had a chance to say anything.  i could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could i get her to come back to my table.  i tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  i didnt know what it was and didnt want to know.  almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  i asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. i didnt expect to get the stinkeye.my egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  the server really wasnt that into the experience, but again gave me the stinkeye when i told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since i knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  i mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. i took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  i ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  it was thick and gooey and the flavor didnt wow.  i saw no reason to continue.  i moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  the skins were a bit thick and doughy.  the meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  the sauce tasted a little odd so i tried to remix and it was still off.  i tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  we finished our dumplings.our lunch entrees arrived.  i had ordered mine extraspicy, but i guess it came pittsburgh hot super mild and had a lackluster flavor at best.  the meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  i tried some of changs chicken and was equally mollified.  this was supposed to be their version of general tsos chicken.  now i have never had a generals chicken that was the same at any place.  it is always different.  many of them are good in different ways.  this food, though, it wasnt good.  changs chicken fell into the same category as the sesame chicken  since it tasted mainly of soy sauce  with the addition sugar.  i just dont understand how anyone can like this place.  even the yoshida sauce you get at samscostco tastes better.
stars are for the food only.    2.5 ratinggot there at 8pm on saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me nowfyilove the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory.  i had the singapore rice noodles.  this was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  the fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   some good notes were the dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. the service was annoying.   we were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  i had to sternly say at one point that i will let you know when i am finished.  i found it rude especially since  there wasnt even a line at this point.  i think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  the result never quite met the anticipation.
sadly ive been here a few times because its a crowd pleaser when my girlfriends parents come down to visit. theres nothing really wrong with it. the portions are big and the food is alright and the interior gives you the superficial impression that youre encountering fine dining.the food is sooooo bland though. everything you get at p.f. changs you can get elsewhere in pittsburgh at a much lower cost and itll be made with more precision and have better flavor. the honey chicken at p.f. changs was so mediocre all i could think about while eating it was heading over to wai wai in bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.last time we were there the server was horrendous as well. i dont think ive ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. he brought my girlfriends father don his unsweetened tea then told him he didnt bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. he then got all huffy when don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. when he came back to take our order don ordered for himself and his wife and before janey my girlfriend and i could order he had already started to walk away. we actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either after that he must have thought we were terrible diners i dont think ive ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or anyone for that matter and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. it was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.obviously the attitude of one idiot who cant hide his bad day well doesnt really have anything to do with the restaurant. but its soooooo bland! go somewhere else for chinese! look up chinese on urbanspoon and itll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.
the service was lackluster. coffee was warm but delicious. limited to one cup, apparently, as the waitress never offered a second.daughter had sweet and sour shrimp. wife had spicy chicken. i had wonton soup. dumplings as an appetizer for the table. all arrived warm. the brown rice was dry as sand and the white rice was delayed by rice cooker problems. also dry as sand. i guess that is how they serve it.the base flavors for the shrimp and chicken were nearly identical. i had expected them to be more diverse. in all, expectations were not met for what is advertised as upscale. id rather have the local chinese cuisine which more flavorful, and much less expensive.
i really enjoyed my mongolian beef and pork pot stickers, but there was no presentation of pfc mixing sauces. one of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill non franchise is presentation and experience.  i was extremely disappointed by the lack of presentation. reservations:our party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations.at 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party . obviously someone dropped the ball here.....when we requested silverware for the table. our waitress blamed it on the hostess. yes, thehostess should have provided silverware.. however it was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck. as a patron i could care less whos fault it is; just in fix it. defiantly took away from my pfc experience.my hot and sour soup is usally served withnoodley things that i drop in the soup. we werent given any noodley  things . not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isnt selling food as much as they are selling an experience. this experience is what sets this restaurant apart.
let me start by saying that i do like their food. last night i went with my wife and two guests. the apps came out fast and were fantastic. dinner on the other hand, didnt come out quickly at all. the rice was undercooked, and we told our server. he set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. by the time i was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice.is that the way rice is prepared now?i ordered the chocolate cake. i asked for a container to take half home. the server brought out a small container and when i asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. she then realized that a larger one would be better.4 people, not crowded...2 hours total.
ok so ive eaten here more than once but just thought to write a review on it. now, ill be honest this is the only one ive ever been to, so i dont know if theyre all the same but every time im underwhelmed. i get there, look at their giant selection and get excited. then i get my meal and remember that ive never had anything too great. dont get me wrong, its not bad, but for how much they charge, they really need to step it up or at least give me a huge portion. just saying...
our last few visits have left something to desire, one of the things i always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees. these people look miserable, no one smiles or greets you appropriately, its more like get in, get out, turn the tables,the food has remained consistently good... when we can order it. the last time jb and i came for a quick dinner, the place was not busy yet we were passed by 6 frowning waitstaff without getting drinks... for 15 minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table hint, hint so we left and most likely will not be returning.
if you look at other reviews you will see that i am a very positive person, but tonight was an utter disaster!!  we sat at the bar and the female bartender  was miserable. we ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did.  she spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took 3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty. we ordered appetizers and they never came out.  she actually brought us our check and we never got our food. by the way we were the only people at the bar.  finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed. we payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready. we finally got seated by the windows. do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. we ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks. after our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. nothing was comped and no manager was available. this pf changs needs new management!! we will never return. i will give it 2 stars because the food was great, but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders. steer clear until changes are made. its not worth the headache.
i seriously dont know why people love this place so much, the food here is horrible. the rice is never cooked properly.. and its not even asian food. its fake asian food. i never come here anymore.
this place has gone downhill and i dont expect that we will be going back. in fact, i dont expect it to be in business past christmas. they raised their prices, changed the menu, and removed several of our favorite dishes from the menu. the veggie dumplings are gone, the jasmine iced tea is gone, and the minidessert are gone. the food is meh. my broccoli was mushy in the ginger chicken and the sauce was like candy because it was too sweet.
disappointing : i expected more out of pf changs. all i can say is that there is better chinese at a non chain place, and it is cheaper. wouldnt go back. i you want chinese go to how lee, or china palace.
ive had bad experiences here a few times now.  i wrote panera bread and havent heard back.  bad service all around!!!  basically, we ordered our food, they ran out of what we wanted, so just decided to make us something else with out telling us.  when we got our food, we asked why they made us that instead of what we orderedoh it was the closest to what you wanted.....hmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay, and how about you give us our money back.  really, you dont get much for what you pay for at panera.  its not very good at all.
panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant i have ever been to. i have posted two pictures of the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. the first one looks delicious the second one looks like they couldve used a smaller bowl. it did not even look appetizing.
the problem i have this experience compared to my last is that the examination lasted 3 minutes.  the vet checked the ears, teeth, and nails then called it a day.  i came home looked at his teeth and saw my pup had a slab fracture  which was still attached to the gum.  the vet didnt mentioned it during the exam other than telling me to buy a finger brush to brush his teeth.i was primarily there for a vaccination shot but if theyre going to charge me for a examination, they should do a proper examination.  i just felt i was rushed out of there. i took my dog to another vet where they told me about the slab fracture, gave me info on how it usually happens, potential problems that it can cause, and recommendations on ways to fix the problem.
