We checked this place out this past Monday for their wing night We have heard that their wings are great and decided it was finally time to check it out Their wings are whole wings and crispy  which is a nice change of pace I got their wet Cajun sauce and garlic butter wings The Cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin The sauce was also thin for the garlic butter  but that is more expected They were better than average  but I dont like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat I would definitely come try this place out again to sample some of the other items on the menu  but this will probably not become a regular stop for wings anytime soon
Decent range somewhat close to the city  The mats are pretty solid; however  the grass range needs to be tended too  Its like hitting out of US Open type roughnot very amenable to practicing  Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf rangeStill gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game  but are somewhat short on time having a job kinda sucks sometimes  no?
Have been coming to this gym for many years now mainly because of the proximity to my house and low ish price   Pros:  engaging  diverse range of classes that get switched up often I have seen tai chi  cross fit  kettle bell  etc they make an effort to keep up with fitness trends and the teachers are often inspiring and sociable Going to spin and aerobics classes at EF can feel like being part of a community if you want it to   functional equipment  various types of elliptical machines Some things are old but some are new    Cons:  inconsistent with providing free sweat towels Sometimes they are there sometimes they arent Not the hugest deal in the world   NO SOAP IN THE WOMENS BATHROOM EVER Seriously disgusting at a gym to know that no one is washing their hands with soap    no pool  yet still costs as much as LA fitness which has more facilities However I understand it is a family owned business so I support them regardless
Good for cheap drinks and wings  they offer daily specials which is nice   Doesnt look like much from outside but the inside is friendly enough  the bartenders have been there for awhile and do a good job Dont expect to have a HUGE selection of alcohol   Their wings are good as are their salads If you are gluten free this is not your placelots of fried food and sandwiches  Offers a quick lunch
Good beer selection Understaffed for a light Monday night crowd  it wasnt her fault she was the only server But it took about an hour to get our sandwiches Mine was one of the best reubens Ive ever had
We met a couple of friends there on a Friday afternoon about 440 pm  based on the Yelp reviews Ive relied on Yelp in over a dozen different cities  never came away with anything less than a positive experience until today   We ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down  there couldnt have been more than 20 people in the place  counting the people on the patio  Took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad I tried the fish sandwich  came out fried extra crispy on the ends  if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified  it was just ok Ive had better at almost any church that fries fish during Lent   All 3 of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten Bread french fries and onion rings were good though Iced tea was good  though Ive never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack Asked for sugar but never saw any  they dont carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff  I may give the place another try in the future for a Reuben or hamburger  assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that Waitress was pretty good  held up under my multiple requests to find out if they caught my fish yet  hardly ever rolled her eyes :
The bar is nice enough the servers are attentive enough the food is good enough Their is absolutely nothing wrong with this place but the problem is it is not a place that will stick out from the crowd Its kind of lost in the crowd Pittsburgh is a city full of bars this one is relaxed Its a great neighborhood bar And I would come back but it is not a wow that is a great place  Its just good enough
Friendly local bar with great service and good food   wont be disappointed if you like bar food at a reasonable price  Good place to go for Friday fish sandwich 
Im not by any means a gear head  Im lucky I know where to put the gas in my car I have Triple A in case I get a flat  because I have no idea where my jack is I took my present car back to the dealership the day after driving it off the lot to have them show me how to turn on my hazard signal  also  to show me how to release the parking brakes  and how to turn on the rear defoggers Yes  the owners manual was in the glove box  but there was way too much reading involved  and I learn quicker by hands on training  Advanced Auto is a God send for me  when I needed windshield wipers  the ones on the car sounded like a cow being skinned alive each time I turned them on So  I didnt use them often  which isnt good in a driving rain storm I walked in and went up to an associate and asked him where the wipers were Not only did he get me the wipers  he saved me a ton of embarrassment by putting them on for me at no extra charge I gave him a nice tip which he refused  but I insisted I also picked up a nice leather steering wheel cover proud to say I figured out how to put that on without a mechanic and a gas additive to clean out my fuel system   This place has everything  and if youre not a gear head  theyll either show you how or do it for you Great customer service
I actually stopped at the one at the Crafton Ingram shopping center but they are all basically the same   I had been here earlier this year to get replacement wiper blades The man who helped me not only gave me his recommendation on what would be good for winter driving but also put them on my car  Todays visit was to purchase some general car supplies as a holiday gift They carry basically everything you need for self service Im not overly sure on their pricing but since it is convenient for me I visit it  So far Ive been pleased with my purchases
I have never seen a restaurant that has a frowning brownie aka Frownie as their icon  mascot  or spokesperson  Kings Family Restaurant has surprised me with this  I think it might be in direct dialogue with Eat N Parks smiling cookie   funny funny odd  not funny ha ha  We were seated rather quickly by the manager  Very nice people work here  I was happy to find that even though they had closed a section  the server was willing to stay longer to serve us our dinner  We chatted with the server a little bit   she was quite engaging   and then moved on to order our meal:  Tea Pepsi Open faced Hot Turkey Sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy Buffalo Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n cheese  Our drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area  She would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed  Eventually  our entrees arrived   both piping hot  I went straight for the macaroni and cheese  It didnt taste bad  but I swear that it is made by Stouffers  I didnt feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat  I tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but  again  they didnt taste bad with the brown gravy  I moved on to the main part of my meal   the buffalo chicken strips  At least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild  I contented myself with eating them    I tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it was not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated  I finished off my dinner and was happy in the end  No  it wasnt the best food in the world  but the service greatly helped the perception and it didnt taste bad
So back in the late 90s  there used to be this super kick ass cinnamon ice cream  like an apple pie ice cream without the apples or the pie crust  SO DELICIOUS  However  NOW there is some shit tastic replacement that tastes like vanilla ice cream with last years red hot in the middle: totally gross  Fortunately  our server was nice enough to warn me about the change and bring me a sample  so I only had to suffer the death of a childhood memory rather than also having to pay for it  The portions are big and filling  just dont come for the ice cream
Breakfast Time  I stopped by the Kings Family Restaurant prior to grocery shopping    I have never been to a Kings Family Restaurant since moving to Pittsburgh   There are several local establishments  This particular location has pretty good food at a great price   It is similar to a Cracker Barrel and  or Bob Evans   I ordered something very hearty   Country Fried Steak   Eggs  and Cheesy Potatoes  The food and coffee were good    The service was excellent   I will go back    Breakfast runs from $5 8     My breakfast cost me just over $10   very comparable to Cracker Barrel  Bob Evans
Not bad for a Shop N Save  most are privately owned  so availability of items might differ from place to place The only time I frequent S n S is when the have their huge two day sales usually held on Thursday and Friday at least once month  Good bakery at this location too
Unfortunately  I only have one complaint about this dry cleaners It was well kept and clean inside The man waiting on me Im guessing the owner was very nice  both dropping off and picking up  even though I lost my ticket Turn around time was OK for a cleaners that dont do cleaning on premises Whats my problem then? Price My daughters dress was $18 to clean I think thats close to what I paid for it My ladies shirts were $6unit Maybe Im not calibrated on Pgh prices but this seems outrageous My search continues for a neighborhood cleaners BTW  they do mens tailoring there on site and it looks like it might be a big part of their business I would try them again for that after I check costs
Typical BP Usually pretty crowded in the evening due to location on Washington but never had to wait to long Staff is pretty nice and always pleasant Cant comment on the coffee or anything else because I only ever get gas
I have been to this place a million times over the years Have been there during the years it was less than clean  to the present where it is almost clean This place is a neighborhood standard that for some reason compels you to return  even if your experience was less than stellar Fancy it is not Gourmet it is definitely not Every item on the menu seems to come from a can  bag  bucket or box The wait staff is often clueless and changes like the wind I have never had the same server twice But the fact is you get a decent meal for a decent price and always have a little to take home Yes  the salad bar is very basic Not every item is a fresh as it should be The iced tea often takes on the taste of Lord knows what However   the fried fish dinner is one of the best I have had anywhere in Picksburg Their meatloaf is terrific as are several of their hoagies In a nutshell  this place has a lot of flaws Like we all do A few upgrades like a better wait staff  fresh gravy instead of their gallon bucket brand  homemade sauce instead of whatever canned stuff they are using would jump this review to 5 stars Rockys is worth going to You will definitely find something you like and you will definitely go back Decent food  decent price  good portions and an overall pleasant experience
If you want a true understanding of Pittsburgh in the morning  come here This greasy spoon is always packed  and is one of the better of its kind south of the city  They serve waffles in halves  which is great The eggs and toast are good  the homemade hot sausage is excellent The drawback are the barely cooked potatoes  If youre hungry  get The Mixed Grill Gab and Eats brand of the kitchen sink breakfast that all Midwest places are about
OK  what is with all of these CASH ONLY places in Pittsburgh? I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their storeresturant  but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past  this would deter me from eating at this place   Looking at a standard breakfast menu  I decided to go with a tuna melt instead What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal  but to no avail One day later I cant even remember what my side was I suppose it didnt leave much of an impression on me  I have to say that the dessert was really good The cherry pecan pie I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome The cherries were not the sweet canned variety  but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar I think I want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree  My first impression is Eh  I am learning how crazy Pittsburghers are over breakfast Seriously  waiting 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows:    2 eggs and toast $xxx 2 eggs  meat  and toast $xxx 2 eggs and pancake $xxx  Id rather go to a Dennys and order the create your own Grand Slam
Really just OK It was chaotic and no one alerted us to whether we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated  and when we tried to ask a woman working behind the counter  she gave us a dirty look like we werent welcome there Eventually we just sat down and someone came by to take our order The server was nice enough  but wasnt very quick with the coffee refills   I finished my first cup slowly and then it sat empty for about five minutes Food was ok  but not amazing We got the mixed grill and a pancake  and both were solid but not outstanding  Not a bad place to go  but we probably wont go out of our way to go here again  either
This place is divey but cute The food is obviously not five star  but its a great place if you want to get a good  hearty breakfast We went there for lunch and got burgersoddly enough the server said that they dont sell French Fries on Sundays? So we had to settle for home fries I thought it was a little weird at first  but damn  those home fries were good I didnt even care after that The coffee is great too Its a unique little place Its basically one long strip of a kitchen  then booths set up right beside it They also have a pretty cool breakfast bar where you can sit and watch them grill all of the food to order The coffee cups didnt match   they were all Christmas mugs lol   they have a wall in the back where you can sign your name with a dry erase marker  and they have little trivia boards on the wall just for fun Its definitely a place of its own kind The prices are very reasonable  and I would definitely go back again
My husband and I tried this place for the first time today It was easy to find and no problems with parking Its Seat Yourself  but there were no signs stating this  so we stood there looking like fools for a minute It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and Im guessing that this was Barb She apologized and said that one of her workers called off today No big deal and her apology was appreciated She came back with our drinks  dropped them off  and left again We didnt see her for another 20 minutes Ultimately  we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order This was aggravating to me I dont mind waiting for my food if I know its going to be awesome and theyre making it with love  but come on now We ordered the hot pepper omelettehome fries toast and chocolate chip pancakessausage The food was alright  really nothing special A new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive We may or may not go back
For the price I ended up paying  this place was fine There was a full kitchen  king bed and TV I was just surprised at the lack of amenities at the hotel While I have stayed at other extended stay hotels  I was surprised to find a sign in the room at this one stating that you only got your room cleaned once per weekif you wanted it more often than that you would have to pay for it If you needed fresh towels  youd have to go to the main desk to get them They also only provided a small bar of soap in the roomnot the typical soap  shampoo  lotion  etc This didnt bother me too much as I was only staying a couple days but again I found it surprising not to have these basic things   The hotel in general was easy to get to and very easy to get back onto to freeway from The hotel was clean and the people who worked there were very nice
Front desk gets 4 starts  However  if youre looking for a good night of sleep  you may not get it  The refrigerator made a lot of noise at night every time the compress kicked on  Likewise with the air conditioner  If you didnt bring a hair dryer  youll have to get it at the front desk  Theres a sofa bed but no extra pillows nor blankets
3612  visit    i am from san francisco bay area and if u want a dive go to china town in san francisco   this place was dirty like chinatown dive but some of the best food i have every tasted came from a dive the food was really good and my group ordered a bunch of different things it was all good  a  taste  prices are reasonable a      they dont speak english very good and got my order wrong sweet potatoe fries a+ pizza    a eggplant hoagie b+ greek salad b+ gyro a+ if they scrubbed the place down and the lady spoke better english 4 star 
Are you are really looking at the review for LJS?  Its fried stuff  with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat  You will regret eating it 30 minutes after you finish  but it is delicious
I agree with Paul on this one But I had to stop here on my way home from work tonight  I think I feel my heart yelling at me again   The gal at the drive thru window was just soooo sweet   I just might go back and ask her to marry me  But then again   she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online  Maybe she just wanted my positive response Ok Sarah B you got it  now wheres my free coke ?
Don Don is a restaurant I find myself missing now and again  its probably my favorite restaurant in Carnegie Simple setup  just a small restaurant with a few tables and a TV Oddly enough I think my favorite thing to eat there is the wonton soup  never had better The food is average but I always enjoyed eating there  great service and a cheap place to get Chinese food
I came here with two friends prior to visiting Apis Meadery next door this past weekend  I ordered the General Tsos chicken  and my friends ordered the sesame chicken  crab rangoon  and another appetizer egg rolls?  They ordered the combo with less meat  and I ordered the one with more the names were very similar  which I found confusing The food took quite a while to come up ~15 min  so Id suggest calling ahead if youre in a rush  While we were waiting  the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in Chinese  and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery probably the same person  To be honest  Im not much of a fan of Americanized Chinese cuisine I lived in Singapore for 3 mos and have visited Hong King and Japan; its been awhile since Ive had it  and this dish reminded me why  I dont care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce  nor do I care for the pre cut meat in the dishes I like to cut up my own meat  thank you very much  so the flavors and textures dont do much for me  Having said that  my friends claimed this was the best Americanized Chinese fare theyd had in PGH and they live in Squirrel Hill  so if youre a fan of this cuisine  you can take that into consideration  If nothing else  this meal provided us with some much needed food to absorb the alcohol from the mead  which I appreciated
Dude its Dennys Its excellent drunk food  packed on Sunday mornings  not very good but not really bad either Its Dennys When you walk into a Dennys you know exactly what youre getting into Why the heck are you even reading reviews about a Dennys? Thats like looking for reviews on an ice cream truck  youre getting the same thing no matter which one you choose
Ive been to Papa Js twice and had mixed experiences  Both times I had the banana pepper appetizer  which is great and goes really well with the FRESH and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal  For entrees  me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience  Ive had the fish sandwich very good and the eggplant parm sandwich okay  My girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it  but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing   The service is also a mixed bag  The first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even MADE me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich  The second time  the server was lackluster  didnt know anything about the menu and wasnt able to take proper care of us    I would return to Papa Js  but I my terrible experience last time isnt enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around CarnegieRobinson
Had dinner at Papa Js with a group of 6  I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows It felt like a neighborhood restaurant On a Saturday night  the restaurant was full but not crowded  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress  While she tried  I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table  People ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down  while my lemon drop was made nice  The bread was delicious  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis  We ordered a variety of dishes  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good  The marsala sauce wasnt too thick  and the chicken moist  Hard to tell if the deserts were homemade  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one   On the whole  I was on the fence with my overall impression of Papa Js  A ok probably is the best way to describe it
Service was great Apps delish  specifically the stuffed banana peppers & lentil with ham soup I think I chose the wrong entree though because I ordered a cod with crabmeat special The cod was completely tasteless with some crabmeat layed across the top It all reminded me of boiled fish Yuck Note to self Order the pasta
Talk about overpriced $18 for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously frozen chicken chopped up over it The latter was terrible  thin and flabby and rather unappealing The pasta itself was ok  as was the sauce The desserts are pretty good But honestly  that is a $10 dish whose price has been inflated
I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my wife and 3 other couples  Another couple in our party had made reservations before hand and when we arrived a couple of minutes after that time  we were immediately taken to our table  Whenever you first walk into Papa Js you immediately head past both their dessert case and bread making area  That is pure genius on their part as both their desserts and bread look good  Then to get to our table we also walked past a bar and up a flight of stairs  After that I didnt really see much else of the restaurant  After our whole party had arrived and our waitress had taken all of our drink orders she came back up to our table and promised us that she would be back shortly as she had some desserts to take to a table  After about 15 minutes or so she finally did make it back to our table  For my dinner entree I decided on having the Romano chicken  It came out a short time later with a side of broccoli  The chicken had a nice golden color to its breading and tasted pretty good although a bit salty  I can take at least some credit for that though as I may have used the Parmesan that was on the table quite liberally  Meanwhile the broccoli was over cooked for my tastes and seemed mushy whenever I bit into it  The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future  I wouldnt be the person to recommend it but I also wouldnt turn it down  I feel like the prices were fair for what you got and only wish that the service was a little better
This is a tiny Starbucks and it locations like this although cute makes you wonder if your really meant to hang out or just grab your coffee and leave Leaving is always a good idea at this location anyway since you have a nice fountain in the back with benches and it is a central part of the Waterfront Shopping   Starbuck isnt my favorite coffee chain by any means Is it just me or do all Starbuck coffees taste a little burnt and bitter? No matter how trendy  cool and upscale their establishments are I cant get around the yicky tasting bitterness of Staryucks regular coffees Talk about over roasting a beanMaybe something has changed with their regular coffee but I have not drank it in about a year I am not one for soy caramel latte foofy stuff Still Ill give the establishment tres estrellas for the fact that their espresso is acceptable and doesnt taste half as bad as the regular coffee bean
Mmmpeppermint mocha  In my quest to visit every Starbucks in the USA I have stopped at yet another location  This one is located in the center of a circle road   very cache and in a newer part of the area
This is a typical Starbucks The coffee is good but the store is suprisingly dirty
I have to agree with Joe on this one  The baristas are extremely friendly  and the service is great  but the fact that there are no comfy chairs or couches is very unwelcoming  I do think however that the building is beautifully ans strategically located in the center of the shopping  I just wish they had better seating
I just realized they remodeled this one recently ish Well  in my world recently because its been a while since Ive been here  Theyve added more seating which makes it way more conducive to having a meeting here Which is my concern during the week I imagine during the weekend it just fills up with tweens getting their sugar rush before hitting the movie theater   The coffee  or tea for me Is still same old same old I dont imagine one single Starbucks will break the mold and make original drinks
As far as Starbucks go  this is a pretty nice one  The baristas are friendly and while I was here  a lot of regulars must have come in  because they bantered away with almost everyone  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasnt overflowing in the canisters around the store  The pastries looked fresh  but I didnt partake  The noise level was also at a nice working level   not too loud  music just barely audible  I do wish there was more seating  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers  but it doesnt replace more tables  Im sure this isnt as much of a problem in the summer when theres the space outside  There was a treat receipt promo going on  but the barista didnt tell me about it  which I found odd  Usually when they have promos like that going on  they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1  I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that mornings receipt  Overall  nice working or socializing environment  Very friendly and inviting  Its what Ive come to expect from Starbucks  so points for consistency
Starbucks is a chain coffee and tea shop you will find most everywhere They offer free WiFi They sell their coffees in bags if you like They also serve sandwiches and pastries Some of the Starbucks Ive seen offer drive through services Prices are reasonable  I stopped in here since Ive been hunting all over for a gingerbread man cookie They told me they are getting one in and ugly sweater design but they dont have it yet I plan to keep checking since it appears that no place I have been to has my holiday favorite so Ill certainly be back to one of their locations
25 rounding up only because of the other places on our stop were so bad   First stop on the Munhall Beer Crawl 2011 It was just a local dive with local beers No microbrews or imports
I have been frequently shopping at this Michaels store over the last couple months since I began taking a cake decorating class and hosted a large baby shower at my home The store has typically had the supplies that I need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies This location is pretty average compared to other Michaels   its exactly what you would expect when going to this store Its not a large store  but its not a small store   just average  I do enjoy using the Michaels coupons when shopping I definitely save a lot of money Instead of toting around the paper versions  I actually have the iPhone app that has coupons available to use from the app   My only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to check out at this location I dont normally have a problem   usually only one or two people ahead of me   but sometimes it can be much slower Today  for example  there were only two customers ahead of me  but one of them was having issues with a coupon The line began to get longer and longer  and though a couple associates were lingering up front  they kept calling for someone else From personal experience of being a manger in a retail store  do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register Whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customers  it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient
Its your typical chain craft store  And let me reiterate that Im not a crafts person I walked in because I needed dial rods for some signs I had Now for being a chain store I was a bit upset because even though they had a decent selection  the amounts they had for each one I wanted were scarce  Imagine me standing there with different sizes of wood in my hand and just staring in disbelief  And for a piece of wood  the price was a bit steep  I will provably come back here  but only for an item that I cannot find elsewhere Or if Im too lazy to drive further out
I dropped by this Yankee Candle store on Saturday to purchase the annual Christmas present candles for my mother in law Between Christmas present purchasing and people wanting their house to smell like balsam and cedar  cinnamon sticks  or caramel pecan pie  the little store was packed However  I was greeted immediately when I entered and was easily able to find the same salesperson again when I had a question Since I was only purchasing votive candles  I was initially pleased to see an entire section for the store devoted to them but quickly became frustrated I couldnt smell some of the votives through their thick  outside plastic Since the votive candles werent all displayed with their scents  I had to walk from the votive display to the fragrance display to better smell the scents and then walk back Outside of that layout frustration  I had a pleasant experience in the store
Its clean  open 247 with hot shoe string fries and creative milkshakes What else do you want in life??
Ah  Steak n Shake  you hit the spot after a night of drinking Open 24 hours  drive thru or dine in  with wonderful  cheap greasy burgers  chicken fingers  breakfast sandwiches  and shoestring fries Youre faster and cheaper than Eat N Park Plus your employees wear those adorable bow ties Granted  if we were at a fancy party  I might act like I dont know you  but deep down inside you know I heart you
Fast food done right  what more can you want?  A throwback to old timey diners  steak and shake is where you get a decent meal at a good price   My sisters and I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon around 3pm catching their 2 4 happy hour  which we read on the door upon entry; a lovely surprise This meant that all shakes and drinks were 50% off   I ordered the western BBQ burger  which was 2 thin patties  cheese  bacon  BBQ sauce  and fried onions It came with shoe string fries my favorite  all for the low price of $479 Are you kidding me? Whats not to like The food was actually pretty good I liked it a lot Since it was happy hour I also splurged on a chocolate covered strawberry shake It was meh Could have gone without it The overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off  but the hot fudge saved it But  how can you really go wrong with hot fudge?  All in all  3 meals and 3 shakes came to $20 A steal Also the food is good I enjoyed it Id come back
Steak n Shakes food is pretty good and the prices arent bad for the quantity of food I ordered a grilled chicken salad with no dressing The salad looked thrown together and was $549 for 2 croutons  tomatoes  carrots  cabbage  lettuce and chicken breast They forgot the cheese The staff wasnt very friendly or helpful and seemed like they didnt want to be there There usually is a long wait at Steak n Shake  but if you catch them when they arent busy  you will breeze through  drive thru that is I do like their food and you can eat healthy options  but the staff isnt helpful and the quality isnt always there
I am not a fan of this chains food or this locations service  However    Steak n Shake milkshakes totally rock  Very thick  regular is the perfect size to get me home from the Waterfront
Drive through service is better than going inside if you want takeout Food is always served hot  inside it just takes a lot longer than it should  both to get waited on at the counter and for the food to come Also  the lids on the milkshake cups are awful and fall off easily Make sure to hold on tight
Really enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would  The drinks were on the pricey side  but I didnt head here to get smashed
Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square  and they died out Then when the chain restaurant magnet waterfront opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery  When it first opened it was pretty cool The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations I know  I was there From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird  Stayin Alive to Shes My Cherry Pie  Elton John to the Boss  they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out  songs only you though you knew  and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song  sounding like the band whos song they sung  But today  Sing Sing seems like its stuck in the early part of the 21st century The whole dueling piano  shout out a song to stump the band  Sing us a song youre the piano man has run its course I dont hate Sing Sing  but I could never come here more than once a year Its a been there  done that kind of place
Came here with a group of girls and didnt have a reservation We paid the cover  walked in and it was absolutely packed There was nowhere to even stand One of our friends was having issues with an expired license and when we found out that not all of us got in  they let us get our $7 cover back without issue   I recently went with a big group who had reserved about 50 seats People who were not in the group kept coming in to the reserved area but the staff was very helpful in dealing with the group   They brew their own beer so do not expect to see any known brands There are only about 6 beers on top  so if you are more of a light beer drinker you might not be too happy with the beer choices They also have mixed drinks and wine The mixed drinks around about $9 and they have a limited number of bottled wines despite what it says on the menu   The entertainment was great and I would recommend it for a group outing But definitely make sure that you have a reservation
The musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd  so I cant say they are all bad  However the minimum for a song request is $5  I spent $20 on a song for my girlfriend and they NEVER played it  They were playing songs for $5 and $10  but my $40 got me no where  Even if they didnt know the song  which I doubt  they could have picked one they knew and improvised   my tip  save your $$ on the requests  Otherwise its fun for special events every once in awhile
Pretty fun place to go every once in a while  but  believe me  by the end of the night youll be ready to go The show lasts around 5 hours  by the 3 hour mark youll be sick of sitting there in the crowd with your $9 a pop drinks listening to the same dirty jokes over and over and over again
My best friend took me to Sing Sing for my bachelor party I had a blast The musicians dueling pianists made fun of me in a bunch of songs They also were really good at playing requested tunes rock When the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected Rock Bottom restaurant for some grub We all had so much fun that we went back for my buddys bachelor party  There were some drawbacks though We went on a Thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty And of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty But its not our fault the place is empty on Thirsty Thursday  if their drinks werent so damn expensive maybe more people would show up And sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious Also there was no table service  and the only bartender was a bitch Ill probably be back  but only for a special occasion when I can afford it
Talented piano players  but I found it annoying they kept pushing for tips all night long We got the message Server was nice and songs were good It was super loud in there so be prepared Super crowded Saturday night so make sure you come early
Typical  but new    You see all of the people that are walking in and out and  I must say  the customers look like they work for a living hear  I swear one of the guys was covered head to toe in soot  That is amazing    Ran around the store looking for those few items that I needed to satisfy my need to build and create  Minimal help from the small quantities of employees  but some of them actually asked if I needed help   after I had found the item
Your typical area big box hardware store  Its convenient to go to because of the proximity to other stores and how close it is to so many communities  Cant really say much else about this place other than with the self checkout lanes its a breeze to run in and then out without having to deal with a single associate
This local Lowes serves its purpose for my husband and me   a convenient home improvement store that we run into every month or two I am most impressed by the lawn and garden section of the store I am not sure how it compares to other Lowes stores  but when shopping at the Home Depot in North Fayette last fall  their flower selection was dismal compared to this Lowes
35 rounding down Its been a while since JB and I ate here and I would consider going back but we just havent gotten around to it The beer selection looked great but the first 3 beers that I wanted hadnt come in yet they were in the middle of expanding their offerings  this really bothers meif you dont have the product  dont put it on the menu  Its not necessarily vegetarian friendly  I got a pizza and it was good  not fantastic  only good Justin was satisfied with his meal Its a good place to eat if you live in the neighborhood but I wouldnt recommend going out of your way
Stopped by on a Mon evening after trying to dine at Smoke Taqueria which is closed Mondays Parking on street in front or behind off Hay St Super friendly bartender In warmer months they have huge outdoor area & big screen & upstairs cornhole game area Okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection Tried the italian club which was really good   two of us split one Also tried sweet potato fries   amazingly good Home made chips w bleu were overpowered by sauce Bathroom was in need of plaster and wall repairs & was grossed out by toilet brushholder on a shelf near toilet at eye level Bet its a fun place in warmer months
Im reading on here that the food is really hit or miss Ive only gone to Dukes one time  but the food was good It wasnt too busy so our service was very attentive and it didnt take long to get our food at all  The place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area We sat in the dining area because the bar area was pretty full The dining room area definitely fills up with an older  have lived in Pittsburgh all their lives crowd  while the younger crowd is in the bar area   Ill definitely be back since I live in the area
Came back tonight after a hiatus and missing out on getting food from the Franktuary truck at Voodoo Homestead I was going to get a burger until I saw on the back of the menu that they do prime rib on Saturday evenings For $19 you got a large cut of meat  which was pretty tasty  a large side salad  and I chose a loaded baked potato for the side They were a little chintzy with the sides The prime rib came with no horseradish sauce or au jus I asked for a horseradish sauce  which they had  but the container was so small I had to ask for another It was a similar situation with the large side salad It was pretty big  and required at least a second side of dressing The food was all pretty good  with the prime rib taking the lead and the baked potato bringing up the rear As always  the beer selection was pretty solid and I really enjoyed my East End Brewery Monkey Boy
I went to Dukes Upper Deck Cafe recently and overall really enjoyed my visit  I went there to watch an Elite 8 game  and felt a little out of place as I was the only person in the bar that didnt seem to know everyone who was there  However  that quickly went away because the regulars and bar staff were extremely friendly and made the entire game more enjoyable I was cheering for my alma matter from outta state and they all encouraged me to enjoy the game and not worry about bothering them if I was loud    The drinks were very fairly priced and feature a full bar and some great craft beer options The food was just OK  I ordered the wings  which were very good in a unique way  The sauce is a mix of ranch and buffalo sauce and the wings come submerged in it Initially this threw me for a loop but after trying them I can see why people love them  messy but delicious I also ordered the pita pizza  i would not recommend this as it just wasnt very good    I am looking forward to returning to Dukes this summer when I can sit outside and enjoy some craft beer and those delicious wings
The chili dogs rock  The portions are huge so come hungry  Big selection of appetizers that go beyond the standard bar food list  Great selection of draft beer  Noise level is good for lunch but may be loud for dinner
Had corned beef sandwich Meh   Onion rings were horrible Extremely breaded and doughy Greasy as all get out I hope the chef will take the hint when all of the breading comes back  as I had to peel it away to get to the onion
This was actually the first time Ive ever been to a Dave and Busters  Walking into such a huge space  especially coming from the often narrow venues in San Francisco was strange  Un nerving actually   Because Dave and Busters is all about excess Almost obscenely so  As far as food   their stuff is standard Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out   not very healthy At all actually You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options  But most people dont come to Dave & Busters for food They come for the games  And while Ive never been that into video games or arcade games   my brother and sister always have  I was apprehensive about having a good time here    but after awhile   my siblings enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself  Especially once i realized that I have mad skills at Skee Ball And proceeded to dominate  Trust
Because I have significantly younger sisters  I go to Dave and Busters about twice a year Its fun for them and nostalgic for me It can get expensive and the prizes are cheap but it make for great sister days   As for the food  weve eaten there once and never again Its just blah frozen and fried The veggie burger was put on there as an afterthought just so they could say they offer it A frozen Boca patty thrown on a bun Thanks I could have ran to Costco for that Drinks are rather expensive but thats to be expected   So go for the games  fun and laughter and maybe stop somewhere else for drinks and a bite to eat skip the bountiful chains that span the Waterfront and try Blue Dust on Amity Street
A table for 16 please   That is what I had to ask for and knew that D&B could accomodate  I happen to be in the Homestead area for work   I really wanted to dig into my Yelp bag of tricks provided by local Yelpers and introduce my team to the Shock and Awe they deserved but  the shear numbers would made it hard  When I started thinking about how we would have a manageable lunch   The only idea I could come up with was the Golden Corral   I knew that was not going to work for me  We decided to do something local and walking distance   D&B was it  It is what you expect   quiet for lunch video games and a bar nearby but I had to forgo any festivities   it was a work lunch   I was pleased they had a under 600 calorie menu   I am trying to maintain a normal diet due to my stretchy pants being out of style and not wanting to look like a character out of Family Guy  The waitress was very friendly and organized    I ordered the Cabo style Chicken   Chicken Breast lightly seasoned and char grilled  topped with pineapple pico de gallo and served with spicy rice and steamed fresh vegetables  It was eh   The chicken was cooked but the pineapple pico de gallo was bland  The rice was bland  The vegetables were cold   I really blame it on the fact I was with 15 compatriots for lunch so I am giving it a fair rating  Everything was edible  My team went with deep fried foods and burgers   They seemed pleased  Service   very good Food   okay  not great   My meal was $13 Ambiance   well it was clean but there were not really any people in D&B  There are so many other choices for lunch that are local and close  I would definitely recommend another in Squirrel Hill   I suggest you use Yelp to find you a better one then come back and play ;  
Dave and Busters has to be split up into separate experiences to rate it   Dining: 2 stars  I had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time  and arrived early They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess  after taking my name  never spoke to us again She did not tell us when we could sit  how long it would be  or any other information And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us Mind you  there was no one else waiting  and the table was ready  and we were ready to order But they didnt tell us this; I didnt even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait I still have no idea why we were forced to wait   When my full party was finally seated  we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice BUT  our service was rather haphazard People would order drinks and food  and get things at wildly different times One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink I know there was chaos to a big party  but it got a little out of hand  The food is pretty standard American chain food  comparable to Applebys and Chilis   not offensive  but nothing to knock your socks off It has a decent selection  and a few good desserts and appetizers  and everything was competently prepared Overall  it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices  but some of the service standards are poor In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&Bs for games  Bar: 1 Star  Drinks are predictably expensive  but there is a wide variety The problem is that about half of them dont even kind of resemble what is on the menu  and most dont have enough alcohol to even taste Worse yet  while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade  the staff is either completely non interactive or just rude You have to track them down  and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life  Arcade: 4 Stars  There are a lot of great games here to play  and many that are fun with groups or pairs It is a great place for a large party  because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games If you are a couple  there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems  and are typically polite The ticket prizes are cheap as expected  but kind of fun  and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help   Overall: 3 Stars  If you want to hang out here  I would suggest eating somewhere else  and then playing games and having fun here  but only order beer at the bar and dont expect a smile
Chuckie Cheese for grown upsYeah  that could sum up my review for sure but Ill try to make it a bit more interesting than that  First let me say that this isnt my first trip to a Dave & Busters  Second  I actually experience all of it while here  We will start with the foodservice  Staff  you were wonderful  You were polite  you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door  gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery  Food  you were not wonderful  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat  There wasnt enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like which I hoped would be the best part of the dish  Im a bit of a potato freak  but alas  I was let down sad face They were cold and such a tiny portion  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of its container  Oh food  how if I didnt need you to survive  I wouldnt complain about you  The building right now is in disarray  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room  Speaking of the game room  by far the best part  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card the best part of the meal  super charge it for $3 more and its even better  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well  One good thing is the games  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun  or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play  I will return again  but only after I eat elsewhere first
Not really sure what to add  So Ill bullet point my experience    Expensive poorly made drinks   Friendly but slow service   Ok food considering Had the Philly Steak and Cheese   Over run with kids before 10 that seem to have zero adult supervision   15% of the games were out of order Air Hockey  Big Bball Game  12 of the skee ball  random other arcade machines   Expensive games   Fun time overall with the wife
i had fun here fun big kid games for me O But the bartender Melissa was a SUPER bitch and RUDE  Hope they fire her
First time at Dave & Busters and although I didnt go for the games  I was slightly disappointed I went with a group of girls for dinner and drinks The service was slow but the food was decent The portions were huge but they are priced slightly higher than the average chain         We went before 9 pm and there were a ton of kids there on a Friday night I do suggest if you want to avoid the children to go after 9
DAVE & BUSTERS  Its a nice place to eat  have fun and drink  All ages can enjoy this place  I was so EXCITED to hear them announce that after 10p  all children whether accompanied by a guardian or not had to go  It made for a nice evening for adults only    Everytime we go whether we play or not we enjoy ourselves  I didnt give it FOUR STARS because every time Ive went I havent been able to eat in the restaurant area of there  I know I still get the same food that everyone else does wherever you sit  Sometimes  I like the nice relaxing atmosphere of the restaurant  I havent as of yet  been seated there    Not to mention that the servers around the bar  are a little slow at responding to customers as well  So all in all  D&Bs is a good spot to stop at for food and entertainment  Just dont expect to be seated in the restaurant portion  and expect to wait awhile for food service in the bar area
Was impressed by the new menu and new decor   Our waitress was nice  knowledgeable and attentive  However  the rest of the staff was less than stellar  There was a power outage less than one minute while we were paying games sunny and calm outside so not sure what happened My family and I were playing a trivia game  we lost about ten dollars of credits and all our bonus tickets when the power resumed   The games were down for about 20 mins after the outage and staff was not friendly when we inquired about what happened or when the games would be working again  After the outage  two people in our groups could not get their power cards to work When we asked staff for assistance they just brushed us off and said we must have been out of credits  Kinda a bummer we lost so much money on malfunction game play tonight
A fun place and lots to do but a bit pricy $2000 will buy you a hundred points which will last you a little over an hourI recommend the bowling game  ball racing car game and connect 4 also there are several games that can be played in groups of 4
ehh  35   I cant rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits Speaking of that  Ive been here a few times  but never wrote a review for D&B   Im a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games However  there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits  but no game began There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit each scenerio  Its hard to find a worker walking around and for half price games  you kind of just take your loss with the 13 credits for skee ball hmph  The food  it really isnt anything too fancy Ive had okay food  but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example Its your basic sandwiches  salads  appetizers & a few pastas I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card Besides the game card deal  if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food but to each their own  Try it once I suppose The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying 2 brownies  2 scoops of ice cream one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries Oh & whip cream  Drinks  pretty weak We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes 2 each that is which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didnt really catch a buzz Oh welllll They do have a happy hour from 5 7pm Id go during that time for the best deal I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine Ive never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol   The prizes  as others have noted  the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they cost However  its cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug  cup or shot glass Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic style dart board 1 300? a coffee mug  a D&B glass our plastic one bit the dust & a D&B coffee travel mug I might be missing a few odds & ends  Overall its a fun time but can be pricey Its best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining   I cant lie though  I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours woah  seemed longer than amount of time :D  Speaking of which  in that time frame we played 250 credits cost= $40 but it was half price games
My wife and I went here around 10pm on a Saturday night The food was not spectacular  about the same quality that youd get at an Applebees or some place similar   good but not great  My steak was tough  but my wife enjoyed hers Staff was relatively unorganized we ate at a table next to the bar  and had to wait awhile for a server Food was prompt
Its fun  but much smaller than some of the others Ive visited  Its clean  staff is friendly and its a good way to waste time before a movie They do have good  food Gets a 3 stars because I get bored easily at this location
Fell asleep last night before I got a chance to do my review this place is pretty cool its just an arcade with a bunch of games they have a bar & u can order food as well the prizes have gotten better however there a few games that werent working
Wednesdays are half off game night Menu includes some meals that also provide ten dollar game cards Its loud and crazy but thats what is to be expected The kids love this place Its ok Not my thing but I understand the fascination
Had an awesome time here with my hubby the food was amazing but the games cost so much an the prizes where ok but all in all a good time Ill be bring the kids with next time
I was sad to see of the bad reviews below because I love D&B However  I was just there this weekend and has dinner then went to the midway The food wasnt bad but our service was overwhelmed so we didnt really have a server  and there were a couple small errors with our order The bathroom was a wreck  like always The trash can is always full  floors filthy  and smells strongly of urine Half of the games I played wouldnt read my card on the first try  Bartenders were slow & didnt seem to care  except for the manager   Ill be back for sure but this place needs some serious staff updating
I thought this place was pretty decent My friend and I were both still reeling from thanksgiving dinner so we ordered salads and they were HUGE and tasty I liked my salad though it was slathered in way too much dressing My friends was even more slathered so she didnt dig it too much Wed also ordered chips with guacamole  the guac was pretty good my friend enjoyed her beer I enjoyed my coke I know  Im lame  so yeah wasnt bad  wasnt the best  but it was okay
Not the greatest ale house in the city but certainly not the worst  I like the food and I have tried all the beers  Theyre just OK as far as beer goes  Large portions Friendly staff
everytime i come here i stick with the nachos add chicken add side of guac and ive never been dissappointed  i sit in the bar  grab a drink or 2 and eat those nachos  the bar has a pool table and plenty of flatscreens  rock bottom is a chain but its one of the better chains in the area  ill pass on chilis or fridays and come to rock bottom instead  oh and typically i walk over to target   work off some of those nachos
Little slow on the service and didnt have the beer I wanted on the menu But you get those things when they brew their own beers on site   But the stadium pretzels are good  The cream stout is tasty  The burgers are good and big with the little skinny fries  Im not a fan of the skinny fry  but hey the burgers would choke a horse   and almost did  :o
Even since Rock Bottom opened 7 years ago??? I have always thought it was a dance club  I am not really sure why but I thought it was along the same line as throw back Hi Tops but I did I think I always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space   Well I was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the Improv and Rock Bottom was close   Part of this is my faultI always order healthy items at places that specialize is greasy bar foodthen I am upset when the meal isnt 5 star    I started off with one of their wheat beers  it was alright I nursed it all through dinner so I dont think I was head over heels in love with it  I got the Catch of the Day  Off the Hook  Fish Dish  Sailors Delight or somethingI forget it had some cheesy fish themed name  It was cod meh  that should have been the sign not to get it with roasted asparagus and lemon rice  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading annoyed and the portion of fish was tiny The rice and asparagus were great though   My friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic  The fries were probably pre cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor  Pros: A lot of tables no wait  brew special beers  big menu  could hear the dueling piano bar next door  Cons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside  most of the food was fried  cheese filled  cream based  or wrapped in bacon  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time I do every once in awhile but if you eat out a lot you cant always get the spin dip  burger  and ice cream sundae  I would love to but its just not in my cards I do like like when causal places offer some healthy options
Went with a group after work for dinner and a brew  We ordered a few appetizers first  The wings are good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip was fun  Had a burger  you can create your own from veggie  turkey  or fresh ground beef Had a fresh ground beef and the meat was fresh and cooked perfectly with a fresh bun  The brew pub is nice and was surprised it wasnt busier
Heres the trick to enjoying a meal at Rock Bottom: dont get fancy with your food order  Stick with the sandwiches  salads  burgers  and bar food; and youll be OK  Ive had bad experience will all the fish dishes including the fish and chips  Also  Ive found the service is generally better in the bar area than the dinner area  Join the Mug Club  even if you dont go often  and rack up points for free mugs and beers  Thursdays are Trivia Nights and the DJ is playing the music loud  so go if you dont really want to have a conversation with the person youre with :
I was SO ready to like this place  Turns out  not so much  It was okay  No better than TGIFridays  but better than Eat n Park  The deets  The hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats  We ordered drinks  He a wheat beer of their brewing  me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable  but wouldnt go out of his way to come back just for another oneyes  he DID order another one just to be sure  My Bloody sucked  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind  let alone any other seasonings  Even a good standard mix would have been better  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender  Nope  no better at all  That went back and I went with a you cant screw it up Amaretto sour  It was fine  Hub ordered a Reuben   why  Ill never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long lamented Gazebo in Shadyside  You younguns wouldnt have a clue of the establishment of which I speak  He said this one was fine  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much  Packed a punch of heat and flavor  but the sides were uninspired  Steamed veggies  Any flavor was steamed out in the process   eh  Cheddar mashed potatoes   there was cheddar in there?????  No way  The tab was reasonable   we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off  so our check was for $12 and change  not including tip  Not bad even with the $15 cost of the LS Deal  but had we paid full price  it wouldnt have been worth the experience  Well hit the Improv again   we have before   but  well head somewhere else afterwards
Dined in twice  food ok  atmosphere good
The only reason Rock Bottom gets 3 stars is because of the brews Food was eh  not many vegetarian options and hostesses who will ignore you because they are too busy chatting about who didnt text them back This place has the potential to be great  but sadly  it falls way too short in almost all areas
Watch the fat girls in here They will try to steal your buddys chair in a sec if he goes to the bathroom & then the indignent fat girl had to get yelled at in front of everyone w in ear shot Everything else including the burger & beers I devoured was excellent
I just came here with some friends to hang out and get some appetizer  and I have to admit that I was pretty satisfied with what we got  Though I couldnt find any fried pickles or onion rings on the apps section  there were some blue cheese nachos that really hit the spot  The atmosphere of this seems pretty cool  especially in the pub area
Its not bad Im not into chain kind of places  but if youre with a group that doesnt do anything more adventurous  youll do fine here I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars but the house beer I had will make sure I come back from time to time
Nothing special Just like Applebees  Chilis or Fridays Stick to the bar food burgers  sandwiches  pizza  wings and salads and you will be okay   This was our second attempt at trying Rock Bottom on Fathers Day The first time almost ten years ago We went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks How do you do that on Fathers Day? This time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush  My wife got and loved the Berry Bash Sangria She just said it had too much ice in it Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea  but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasnt sweet enough  We started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app It took at least 15 minutes to get them You get three sliders and they were very good  My wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all  Our daughter got the kids burger and fries No surprise there  I ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste Longhorn has a much  much better quality of steak though The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average   The kitchen sounded like an live episode of Hells Kitchen The waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times The kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there  On a different note  our waitress Susan was very good Come here for drinks and the bar food Skip everything else
Normally the food is outstanding  no more salted bread sticks  but they did bring back the ball park pretzels  Not very good  cool to low warm Hard  dense  Mango ice tea is wonderful  Will see how the chicken comes out  To be continued
Tom and I decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a Saturday night He is a beer buff  and neither of us had ever been there  so we gave it a go  We walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area About 25 minutes later  our table was ready Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table  Our server  Jackie  approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start She was very attentive and funny  and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise  didnt care for it Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits He loved all three  and chose the most bizarre and expensive beer Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Toms choice  and charged us for the less expensive beer Very nice of her  We started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh  not to mention huge We only ate one and took the other to go Very good app though   Tom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger  and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken  which was a pounded chicken breast  breaded and fried  over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw  Toms burger came with a small handful of fries  and my meal was very spread out on my plate  like something was missing Not very good presentation at all The food itself was okay  nothing to write home about The potatoes were my favorite part Tom said that his burger was mediocre  Another note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building  so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides to be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party Yuck  Overall  we might come back for the beer and service  but not for the food And DEFINITELY not to use the bathroom
This place is quite big with a bar area  dining room area  and patio area We decided to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many TVs They also have darts and two pool tables  which I really enjoy When you are in the bar area you can see the beer being brewed through the window which is really cool   I ordered the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend ordered the white wheat  both of which are brewed by Rock Bottom They both tasted delicious and were exactly what I needed for a hot day My friend ordered the Fried chicken entree which came with mashed potatoes and of course she gave me a few bites since we always share It was a pretty delicious meal  but the fried crust fell off a few pieces which I am not really a fan of I ordered the Sante fe salad with grilled chicken not fried The salad was okay I was expecting more flavors overall  but I didnt really get them   It was a good experience and will most likely be back when I am around the waterfront area
This is  a Okay place to eat  The food is nothing special  I guess what they have going for them is the beer  Order the  Guacamole for the starter which was okay but for $850 and the portion was not worth it  Rice Cajun Taco was not cooked well  Would I go there again maybe  If your into beer and watching the game  then yeah go there
Nice enough chain restaurant  Have ordered the fish tacos appetizer and the dinner entree of cajun fish tacos which comes with black beans and rice  Both are ok  though I think Id order something else next time as Im pretty picky about fish tacos    The appetizer tacos were rather dry  The cajun tacos were much better but executed oddly  They come in 2 shells   an inner hard shell and an outer soft shell  Why might I ask?  Why add extra calories for something that seems so unnecessary and doesnt add to the dish in any way    Oh  well  Cant speak about beer here as Im not a beer drinker  The space is pleasant and our server was efficient even if the meal wasnt the quickest to come to our table even though it wasnt busy  Would I revisit?  Probably; it was decent enough with many other menu options  Keep in mind  however  that there are many options nearby worthy of a visit
Standard issue Rock Bottom  We ordered the nachosthey could have easily served 6 people  I have never seen a more massive platter of food  Bar service was okayguy working there was nice to talk to about sports
My visits here are generally pretty consistent  I love getting the beer sampler even though Ive drank all the beers twice over  I wouldnt say I have a favorite dish here yet but the food was always generally good  I guess one thing that sticks out is the chicken mac and cheese and the Reuben    When I go here though  Im going for the beer more than the food  Definitely worth a trip for dinner
There are few local restaurants as popular as this place  the food is consistently good and the service always great I meet people regularly at the bar  we usually have dinner but lately thats not always the case The biggest complaint is that it seems the chef is intent on putting black pepper or some type of hot spice in all menu items
Its been a couple years since I first reviewed Rock Bottom  and while I still dont love the place theyve definitely improved since then They admittedly still arent my first choice food wise because  by design  theyre a pretty generic eatery for the most part  especially compared to other options in the area Their local brews are really the only thing that sets them apart from other places in the Waterfront  and Pittsburgh has so many breweries and so forth now that even that isnt the biggest draw anymore  That said  their brews ARE usually quite good and worth trying Plus  they ARE improving in terms of service and quality of food  and that deserves a mention Sure  I may think their menu of burgers  pizzas and American eats is pretty average  but I also think the quality of the dishes is improving For example  my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked  and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty Some dishes are even more memorable now; I actually really like their veggie burger  which is packed full of flavor that even I  a known carnivore  can appreciate And their fresh pretzels and dip? Absolutely amazing   exactly what youd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven   I was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named Mark  who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated He never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night If Rock Bottom hires more people like him  there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place  I guarantee it  Add in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the Waterfront   a MAJOR plus when planning big outings with friends in the area   and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie  shopping  etc for food and drinks And for that  Rock Bottoms earned another star in my book
For a chain  it is better atmosphere than you would expect  The menu options all sound delicious  but the food quality is not great  Just mediocre
Apps were good  service was average  and the certified angus beef tips were awful  They were severely overcooked and the sauce they were in had no flavor  The picture on the menu made it appear you get a good amount of tips  However  I was given only 4 tips  which in the end I was thankful for  because if I had any more  I would have had to rest my jaw for a couple days due to the extreme toughness and amount of chewing required to swallow those flavorless tips
Loved the American Blonde and grams oat soda IPA  Good service    Egg rolls were very good  Our bar tender was very attentive and helpful in selecting the beers
If your in the market for a beer or two this could be an option They have a nice seasonal selection and its all tap which I prefer I also like that most of the seating is booth On my visit the service was lack luster I have no idea where the waitress went for half the meal and her listening skills left much to be desired I went with a beer sampler It was nice being able to try everything they have I of course went with the pumpkin beer For my main dish I had stuffed peppers which I honestly enjoyed They had a great flavor My only issue is the rice that came with it was a bit under cooked If service was better and my rice was cooked I would have given this place a solid 4 stars but that unfortunately wasnt the case on this particular visit
Came here on a Saturday night Waited over an hour for a table for 2  but enjoyed some great beers from the bar while waiting Ordered the calamari appetizer to start which was very good My fish and chips entree was cold  but my boyfriends 2 am burger was phenomenal
Good club for a good laugh High food prices most comedy clubs are  2 item min The food was less than stellar I wouldve enjoyed Burger King more   Service was decent  I believe the waiterswaitresses could hustle a little more or the club should hire more waiterswaitresses I get grouchy when my glass is sitting empty for more than 2 mins
They have good acts coming around here  and often give out free tickets  particularly ine summer Ive never actually paid full price for a ticket here   The two item minimum is bit bothersome to me thoughI dont mind the requirement so much  but the quality isnt good and the prices are high Our four items total came to about $30 two appetizers and two beers and the apps were really nothing to write home about and the servers arent even very friendly Also bewarethey have a lot of rules here They wont seat till the whole party is there; if you get dinner reservations everyone in the party HAS to order dinner  automatic gratuity added to the check  etc etc  The box office is also weirdyou get your tickets at this window complete with microphone and slide under slotthen you walk into the club and the box office is completely open and the workers are just sitting right there  so I dont get the whole hoopla with the window  All in all though  the seats are comfy enough  the atmosphere is pretty nice  and the acts are good
Came here to see Charlie Murphy  Parking was nightmare I would expect nothing less on a Saturday night The 15 minute wait to get inside was torture They need to implement a system where if you purchased tickets in advance you dont have to wait outside Once inside you we were seated pretty quickly Seating is first come first serve  The Server was pretty quick to take our orders I misread the menu description and didnt realize my BBQ sandwich came  with cheese  I dont eat cheese  and had send my order back The waiter was gracious and returned with my modified order in about 15 minutes Ive never heard of throwing cheese pulled pork sandwich  maybe its a northern thing  We got our checks quickly  and without issue
Im HUGE SNL fan  so naturally if someone whos been in the cast is touring  Ill come here to see them Some have been really greatJim Breuer Some have been surprisingly very badTracy Morgan But its always been a pleasant experience at the venue  Theres not a bad seat in the house and its small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage  Beware if you sit in the very front  you KNOW whats going to happen  A couple downsides   Waiting outside in a line in the dead of winter  The lobby is so small youre forced to wait outside until the first show starts or the first show lets out  And if you want a good seat  you may be waiting in line for a while  BURR  The two drink minimum I kinda get why they do it  to make money  of course But this means they jack up the prices of watered down drinks Better to stick with beer and wine at these places No frou frou drinks for me   Also  as to be expected  the foods not that great In a perfect foodie world  places that served food would make it fantastic Since thats not going to happen  you just go into those places hoping for the best Ive never had anything great here Nacho platter too many re fried beans  to little nachosannnnnd Im out   So what did we learn here? Good venue  stick to beer and wine and eat at a better restaurant beforehand The talent is really what youre there for so  enjoy the show
Ive been here twice now  and like the others you really only come to Improve Comedy Club for the show Very reasonably priced for shows  though they have the two item minimum so would suggest they all be drinks  The food leaves little to be desired We decided for the sake of time to grab dinner at the venue since the show started at 7 Having a free appetizer coupon we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip along with the sauteed grilled chicken Spinach and artichoke dip was good though cheesy rich along with cheese sprinkled on top of the chips Sauteed grilled chicken   hmmm I think the chicken was frozen   definitely not fresh   and the guacamole was artificial with a glop of cheese It looked like a mess with big ole pile of fries A lot of food for $10 Service has always been pleasant though they do automatically tack on the tip for you at 18%
Theres nothing like a Saturday night filled with some good laughs  a few chuckles and a couple of good guffaws thrown in for good measure  Thats exactly what we enjoyed on Saturday night  We hit the comedy club for an evening of Tammy Pescatelli   the hubby and I have enjoyed her routine on TV and on the occasional DVE morning show  She didnt fail to give us a good evening of laughs  The big surprise  was Gene Collier   yep  of the Post Gazette sports writer fame   as the opener  What a great opening act  He cracked wise about the perils of being 58 and a baby boomer  We could relate  The sightlines were lacking  There was a rather large woman at the table in front of us with massive Pittsburgh BIG HAIR  All night long my own head bobbed from side to side as I attempted to actually watch the show  and not just listen to it  as she reached repeatedly and unceasingly for her tableful of snacks    With a 2 drink minimum  my first drink was weak and the 2nd was quite strong  All in all  the two balanced each other out  But then  you dont go for the drinks  do you?  An enjoyable evening
Tom Green was appearing here on Jan 22  2012 He was hilarious   The Improv is an excellent comedy club  in past shows Ive seen Jim Krenn  Margaret Cho  Billy Elmer  and so many more I forget Much like Live from the Improv on TV  the brick back drop makes it feel like the NYC Improv   Hint: eat elsewhere  the food isnt so great  have an appetizer until you get to another restaurant  most comedians head over to the Rock Bottom after to imbibe Dave Attell is a regular at both places Two drink minimum  drink them slow and go elsewhere after the show
Decent  clean as far as I could sense in the dim about on par for what youd expect for a higher end comedy club  That includes the $10drink  two drink minimum  automatic 18% gratuity  and the comic spouting out the obligatory  dont forget to tip your waitress  Trying to judge the place on its own merits and not on the entertainment value of the comics  If the latter  since we were here for Frank Caliendo  Id have given the place the full 5 stars if only for him alone  Total cash bled out of my pocket brought it down from what could have been a 4 star experience for us  $80 for tickets online included $10 service fee and tax we had to: this was a sold out show  Add $25 for drinks  gratuity  and more tax  Were talking 3 digits of $$$ for less than 2 hours of entertainment squeezed in between other patrons and glass wielding servers while you sit on rickety chairs  Thats what a headliner act will cost ya  Will you see us here again?  Probably but cost makes it unlikely to be a weekly thing for us
I love the Improv I think its a great way to start or spend a night Nothing like a laughter filled night I think its great that we get so many great comedians coming our way Owen Benjamin  Pablo Francisco super funny Tammy Pescatelli not so much  Things you should be aware of: The staff is really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drinks I kinda wish their menu was a little bit more extensive Their service is spotty  The wait staff is a little iffy I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not Most recently our waitress was rude  didnt bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us Also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity If our waitress was nice I would be more than glad to add to it but this time I was like no way  ps when I used my groupon I didnt have any trouble
Who doesnt love to laugh? The improv is a great place to go for a good show a few times a year The venue is clean The comedians are good  for the price  and many times you get a steal and can see a great comedian for a low price ieTommy Johnagin However  be advised  if you attend more than one show every couple of months  you will see some of the same opening acts repeated This is my biggest gripe with the Improv Ive been to the Improv about 3 times over the past 4 months and have seen the same opening acts a few times I think they cycle through the same 4 5 comedians Are there not more talented comedians in Pittsburgh? As noted in other reviews  another area of improvement is the drinks and food I always attend the late showing so that I can eat elsewhere The food is mediocre bar food at best Nothing more needs to be said about that I definitely dont mind the two drink minimum Ive been known to consume more than two drinks in one setting but  the drinks are insanely overpriced $5 for a Miller Lite  $4 for a Snapple  $10 for a fountain drink with refills Youre better off having your two drinks during the show and going over the Sing Sing after for a draft    or four In addition  since they started offering a large Groupon discount  the Improv has been packed Be aware that if you only have two people in your party  they may seat strangers at your table who are 6 feet tall and block your view
Spent New Years Eve at the Comedy Club to bring the new year   I am new but it was a good time   We had unlimited champagne  fruit and cheese   The comedy was good  The service was great  The atmposhere was okay but it was a comedy clud :      You should check it out   Comedy clubs bring a little spice to the city :   Enjoy
I love that we have a great comedy club in Pittsburgh with a great location at the Waterfront  Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand  I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron What a deal def check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office  People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom Once they opened the doors 15 minutes before show time the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back  It is not huge inside so there arent really any bad seats  They usually have an MC for the night who starts  warming up the crowd This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron  My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous  $950 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers  The soda was $350 Yikes  At least we didnt pay full price for the tickets
My husband and I love going to comedy shows and have seen some pretty good acts at the Improv Ticket prices arent bad either I am very particular about where I sit  and the person who seats you is willing to let you sit where you choose  especially if its on a Thursday or Sunday night  since those arent particularly busy nights  I did have one bad experience  which is why Im giving this review 3 stars instead of 4 it only takes one poor experience  people My husband and I went to see one of our favorite comedians on a Thursday night There is a two item minimum  so we decided we would just eat dinner at the show Well  we were mistaken First of all  our waitress was rude and slow After sitting there for 5 or 6 minutes without service she finally comes over and asks what we want We both order a drink and food  to which she tells us that the kitchen caught on fire earlier that day so all they have are salads and desserts I was annoyed that she even asked what we wanted instead of starting out with this important fact  At any rate  I order a Caesar salad and a beer It comes out and its iceburg lettuce with shredded cheese  tomatoes  and other veggies In other words  a regular salad I inform the waitress of this and she seemed totally confused I suppose she did not understand the difference  which was odd   Overall  I felt that there was no apology for the fact we couldnt eat  let alone everyone else in the place Salad or dessert arent the greatest choices when you are expecting to eat dinner at the show I think the Improv should have waived the two item minimum on this occasions  even if it cost them money   Afterwards  I emailed the Improv with my concerns Never Heard Back  That being said  I will most likely return to the Improvbut not for the service Because its a great place to see comedy shows and isnt that expensive Customer service is terrible
If The Improv chain didnt bring in such amazing comedians  this place would be totally screwed   I always have fun watching the comedians  but I cant help but leave with such a bitter taste in my mouth from how much of a rip off this place is  First you buy the tickets  but if you buy online you have an outrageous service charge The real kicker is having to buy a minimum of 2 items during the show  beers are $5 or $6 and the cheapest things on the menu  I believe Cocktails are $11 $13 I think glasses of wine are around $8 There is a pretty good selection of food options   The improv does have a lot of great comedians who pass through Even the opening acts are generally great Line up early if you want a great seat right in the front   The point is  a night at the Improv will be fun  but if you arent prepared for it  it can end up being a pretty unexpectedly and unreasonably expensive affair
The food is why I give them three stars  Burger was processed and 12 raw  loaded fries where some random cheese  Comedy depends on who you see
Weve been to the improv comedy club twice now and both shows were amazing; even the opening acts   The only downfall is the two drink minimum  which I understand  but their prices make it ridiculous We stuck to beer because we knew it wouldnt be watered down Our waitress was horrible We did not have an opportunity to order our second drinks until the other waitresses were bringing out checks If our waitress was more attentive  the club could have made more money off of us Oh well   I would recommend eating at a restaurant before the show because the food menu is limited and overpriced   The only other thing Im not a fan of is the seating We were fortunate enough to get there early and have the back of a booth The last few people who arrived got the turned around seats in front of us I feel that the club should invest in long  thin tables like bars have so everyone has a surface to put their food or drinks   Overall  we love the comedians so well definitely be back
Roxy was very funny Would definitely come back to see her
Positives: They regularly bring in national acts  I have seen many of my favorite comics here  Also  you get an opportunity to briefly meet the entertainers on your way out  Negatives: Drink prices are high  and food quality in respect to the price is disproportional  Entertainer wise  there is a local comic who opens up for many of the main attractions  I have seen him open up no less than four times over a span of 3 years  and his act is exactly the same every time  I have it almost memorized  Continue doing the things you do well  and try to improve the things that almost everyone on Yelp complains about  and youll be looking at 5 stars from most  No one wants to come to the Improv to get Straint Up see what I did there  Improv?
I love a good night of comedy But recently i have gone to a couple and they were not all that funny one was a special event too I would recommend eating at another restaurant prices seem to be a little over priced
Nice Giant Eagle  not as nice as their new Market Districts  but you can look at this Giant Eagle and see how they came up with the Market District Idea and rolled with it Fresh made sushi  good cheese selection  awesome bakery
Wahhhhh Theyre remodeling this one and its frustrating I swear I dont mind change I really dont~  I should have seen this coming  There were telltale signs of this happening First  they switched the pharmacy to the other end of the store where the now defunct Iggle video was Thats A ok with me  I didnt use the pharmacy anyway   But THEN  THEN they moved the whole toiletries section over there They put my spaghetti and ethnic food section by the way  I love that ethnic food includes spaghetti to where my Tylenol was My kitty food is now where my spaghetti once was Can you tell how exasperated Im getting??   Did I mention I dont mind change? But heres the thing  I really hate grocery shopping Its kinda sorta my own fault because I must read every label to make sure Im not eating something with 25 grams of fat and 5000 calories even though ice cream may go into my cart from time to time So going to this Giant Eagle frequently was nice because I KNEW WERE EVERYTHING WAS Now I dontwahhh   Ok  Ill stop crying I know Ill eventually be back Im sure ?? it will be an even better more magical grocery shopping experience once theyre done But I cant take it for right now Ill be forced to shop at the Ghetto Bird down in the Southside until my former 1 store is all shiny and new again
This place has amazing selection when it comes to some things and zero selection when it comes to others  We popped in here a couple times over the weekend I spent in PIT and both times they didnt really have what we were looking for  Visit 1: Liquid smoke  Visit 2: Hawaiian rolls  I know these items must exist in PA just not G Eagle    They did however have crazy selection when it came to things likecorned beef brisket or anything that has potato in it  My californian mind was boggled by the variety of brands and cuts of corned beef that were available  Too bad that wasnt what I was there for
I drive near this Giant Eagle on my daily commute  so I shop at this location approximately onceweek The location is pretty  and the beer selection is descent They carry my favorite lambic  so I really cant complain They also have a very nice health and beauty section Overall  they usually have the products that I need  My only complaint would be wait time to check out They never have enough cashiers at peak hours The store has like 20 checkout lanes  but generally only 5 8 open at a time I always dread checking out  and whenever I see that checkout lines look relatively clear  I hurry around the store and quickly gather the products that I plan to buy
Ive stopped by here a few times most recently tonight to pick up random groceries  This store is located next to one of the bike trails that I frequent  hence its convenience despite being fairly far from my apt  On the positive side  I appreciate the size of this store and the selection of products  In terms of size  its larger than the Shadyside Market District my normal grocery store  hence my standard of comparison  and Id say the product selection is very similar  Unlike the MD  when Ive visited  the aisles have seemed fairly empty of customers  which may be due to the times of my visits usually between 7 8pm  as well as the size of the store  Because its not a Market District  the prices are a bit less expensive  which is nice  On the negative side  the checkout always seems to take forever due to slow customers andor employees  despite that Ive only purchased a couple of items at a time  The express lanes move at the speed of molasses  and the self checkouts are even worse  Speaking of which  this store has way too many self checkout lanes about a third of the lanes  and the non express ones with the belts are unintuitive  Prior to tonight  I would have awarded this store a rating of 4 or perhaps even 45  However  checkout tonight was even more of a PITA than it usually is  None of the normal express checkout lanes were staffed with cashiers  despite that I saw at least one employee loafing around talking to another  So  I was forced to use one of the many self checkout lanes  Normally  I dont mind this  esp when Im only purchasing a couple of items  but the empty self checkout lane that I spotted was one with a conveyor belt  and I couldnt figure out how to use it not that it mattered  since I had only one item  but the self checkout lanes must be operated using a very specific procedure see below  So  I moved over to one of the express self checkout lanes similar to those in the Shadyside MD  which I knew how to operate  However  I still managed to bungle the process since I forgot to scan my one item before I put it on the scale that doubles as a bagging station  so I had to wait for one of the ever so slow employees to come over and key in an authorization code so I could pay  Im not sure if the self checkout stands that GE uses are standard in the industry  since Ive never used them anywhere else  but I hate the whole weighingbagging process  In order to use the self checkout stations  each item must be scanned and then placed on the scale  and if the weight isnt correct for any reason including using your own bag  an employee is summoned to check it  I assume the intention is to prevent people from shoplifting  but 1 its a major PITA for both customers and employees; 2 most of the employees including the one I dealt with tonight dont care  and just key the code without even looking at the error message explaining why they were summoned; and 3 I doubt most shoplifters pay for any of the items theyre pilfering they most likely just stuff them into their purse  clothes  etc and walk out  rant  35 stars
I dont know why  but I just cant like this location very much  I lived in the area for a little over three years and would always go to another GE before this one  Maybe its the way its set up or maybe its the way that the lighting seems so very dim  The selection is typical for any GE  broad and expansive  Some prices are a bit steep    This location  like many others  has expanded their pharmacyhealth care area  Which is nice  it saves an extra trip to a drug store
I still cannot believe that Pittsburgh has no independent bookstores  As a result of this I have ended up spending a fair bit of time at this Barnes and Noble location  As with all Barnes and Noble stores it has a cafe and a decent selection of popular titles  I am a bit surprised at how smallish it is compared to other stores in this chain    The bargain section seems to be perpetually picked through  The selection is ok in that it is well stocked but sometimes a bit disorganized from other customers pawing through the books  less popular titles are a bit hard to find  The customer service here is pretty good  They could use more chairs
Great Barnes and Noble location  and they have plenty of books thatll help you pass the time
I have to agree with Matthew U on this one I do enjoy Barnes & Nobles but sometimes i get lost just trying to find a darn calendar I went here after a dinner date with some neighbors and couldnt believe how packed it was We had to wait 10 minutes just to find enough chairs to seat 4 people We ended up stealing them from other tables Not to mention my hubby stood in line for 15 minutes just to get an Ice tea lemonade  So amidst all the books  newspapers and magazines they have an audio and video section The prices arent anything to rave about I can buy the same movies online for a lot cheaper theres just the waiting period I do shop here sometimes for there discount books I found a lot of great recipe and mystery books for really cheap  like under $5 Thats a pretty good deal but considering there is a half priced book store who has a great selection of books for literally half the price of retailers  how can you beat those prices   B&N is more of a hangout spot with books in case you want to buy one right there and then But everything is kind of confusing you always need to ask where something is Id rather shop online for anything i really want Its just not worth it to buy it wholesale
This bookstore is absolutely packed full of stuff They have lots of books  a display of Nooks  DVDs and CDs  miscellaneous items like notebooks and calendars  and a cafe Though a large assortment is nice  I feel like the space is very cramped I have purchased a couple books from here   which were pretty easy to find   and have purchased food items from the cafe   The cafe is not very impressive Ive been pretty underwhelmed by all the food items that Ive purchased here I got a slice of quiche here last night when I only had 10 minutes before a hair appointment at Ulta across the street Not only did they take 5 minutes to microwave it  but it also came out smelling burnt and burning hot   A little band was singing and playing a variety of instruments while I was here I wasnt very impressed until I realized that they were high school kids I thought it as really nice that Barnes & Noble would let them perform in the store and a great way for B&N to get a lot of their family members in the store  too
Are B&N not allowed to have lounge areas anymore? I used to love studying and doing work in their comfy chairs and sit there allllll day but I feel like within the last 4 years or so  I havent been in a single B&N that had such areas anymore I love books and have always felt that B&N can give you a good deal But Im not a fan of this particular location because its not that big Although  it is pretty clean  The Starbucks area they have is okay The starbucks employees in these types of locations are always not the bestbut I dont go there for the coffee obviously I do find it annoying that they dont take Starbucks giftcards though   I believe they take B&N giftcards and you can also apply your B&N membership discount  Also  their bathrooms are pretty atrocious If you can hold it  I would advise you to hold it  Parking: the location is within a shopping areaso I wouldnt say it has its own private lot per se  but its an open lot and not actual street parking
It seems every time we go to Waterfront we end up coming here every time I like the store but it seems rather daunting in that its so huge  Pretty much every time we come here if we havent already hit up the Starbucks in the middle of the walkable part of the Waterfront where many of the retail stores are well go to this one which isnt that far away  Theres much more seating at this Starbucks than the one in the middle as well as it just feels less cramped  The store hasnt changed much  most of the special and clearance stuff is at the front while the alternative entrance at the back is where all the music and movies are  The store is pretty organized though by type whether its childrens  fiction  magazines  games and toys etc theres pretty much something for everybody    The Nook section is pretty much right when you walk in through the main entrance  I do like this store however I wonder how long it will exist with everything like Amazon and e Readers changing how people get their material these days
one of my favorite places to go in pittsburgh with friends good place to chill  eat  drink and watch the game  and maybe some pool afterwards the food is not bad  they have pretty good deals for those who are on a budget dollar burger night where you build your own burger is fun  but the patties can be dry sometimes  so remember to get them sauced iceberg wedge salad is a good salad to have  the wings arent as good as you would like  i had tried the spicy killer ones and didnt even have to drink water but overall its a nice place to go because its cleaner than most bars you will go and it serves better food than other places as well
Nice venue   good food  great beer  awful service  Staying at the Sheraton here Ive patronized Bar Louie a dozen times recently and they screw up the order in some fashion every single time  without exception
An absolute must if youre going to a movie and want a drink $3 drafts and $5 special martinis and some half off apps on a weekday from 5 to 7 However  we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini No gin or vermouth was used  its mostly purees and champagne floats with flavored vodkas  Anyway  the small plates made for good upscale bar food Half price apps make for a cheap  but nice  dinner and a movie   great  great specials However  I would not buy a full priced dinner here Nothing aside from the apps grabbed me for the outstanding price The baked goat cheese was small but delicious  and the tempura fried shrimp was just right but the sauces didnt match up exactly  Be warned that the seats make you feel like youre going to be swallowed by them Seriously  the booth was like sitting in the mouth of a whale
The Pros: Great view of the city and river in good weather   Lovely for loud large groups Varied menu with some original items Great place to watch a game inside with a huge bar Fun location Good place to take out of towners  The Cons: The food when I went yesterday was not great  We got the wrong sandwich  our order wasnt as described because the kitchen was out of lots of things  Tell us when we order  not when you deliver the meal without elements on the plate   Can be loud not a place for a romantic date The bathroom condition was really bad  The server did comp up an appetizer  and they were friendly enough they just failed to wow   The view was great  and we did enjoy walking around seeing the fountain dance to Pour some sugar on me  seriously???  Yes   Classy eh?
Went there on Saturday night following a movie at loews  We sat at the bar and watched the olympics on their  multiple large flatscreen tvs   Ordered the calamari and shrimp quesadillas   The calamari was crisp and plentiful the quesadilla however missed the mark   It wasnt crispy and it tasty sauscy instead of gooey   The menu is large and reminds me of epcot with all the different ethnicities represented   gordan Ramsey would probably comment on the lack of focus at first sight   Miller Lites are $4 a pop which was a big downer as i got my $85 bill for two apps and multiple miller lites    Great atmosphere and probably a fine place to watch the pens game Food looks like its hit or miss  All in all would rather drive down the road to the south side for a post movie food grub and tottie
Service has always been good and the food consistent  we usually come for happy hour when apps are half off and theres some great deals on drinks as well  Things that stand out to me: veggie wrap  fried zucchini  hummus tabuleh and tzatziki platter  and house salad with ranch their ranch is so good I could eat it with a spoon
Food was ok Waitress was a huge air head Waited 25 min for my $700 beer Only got it after I reminded her It is just another disappointing chain restaurant disguised as a local commodity
Although I wouldnt  travel out of my way to have dinner here  this is a resturant that I enjoy having a meal at  when I am in the Homestead water front On all of my visits here I have enjoyed the tempura shrimp The dipping sauce are to die for  Ive found myself craveing the tempura shrimp  and the accompanying sauces   The first time I ever had dinner here was as a birthday dinner with me and my big sister So this resturant has sentimental value to me I attach eating here to having a special night out in the Waterfront   Bar Louie has some very flavorful and fun dishes for bar food  that is
It was the first time that I went to this location  We sat outside and it was a beautiful night  I had the BBQ Burger with fries  For the price of the burger I expected something much better  It was a very thin burger when it came to the meat  As a whole it looked large but that was only because of what they piled on top of it  In addition  their drinks are expensive  Just one cocktail could run between $10 $12 and they arent very large  Our waitress spent more time talking to her friends at the next table than actually tending to our needs  There are enough restaurants at the Waterfront that I dont know that I will come back here
I personally enjoyed my recent visit to Bar Louie with a friend but completely understand the poor reviews on help The restaurant is pricey for what it is  and our waitress was a bit lackluster  So why does Bar Louie get 3 stars? Happy Hour and a nice patio  Happy Hour is on Monday Friday from 4 7pm and offers lots of different options   $3 Drafts  $4 Wines  $5 Martinis  and 12 Price Select Appetizers and Flatbreads My friend and I ordered 4 Martinis and 3 Appetizers between the 2 of us  and our bill was less than $40 total Not bad  I ordered a Strawberry Peach Bellini and a SMores Martini  and both were tasty We shared Bruschetta Pomodoro  Spinach & Artichoke Dip  and Roasted Vegetable Flatbread The food was also good  and I would order all three items again in the future  My recommendation is to understand what Bar Louie is good at Happy Hour and only frequent the restaurant at those times
This place was pretty good food  but the service however was just horrible As a friend said they hire for looks  not work ethic Plus the fact that it took forty minutes just to get a couple appetizers was ridiculous Our server seemed more interested in the table full of girls than actually waiting on us The couple behind us came in the same time and wasnt even attended too until after OUR appetizers were being cleared off   The food was pretty good  but because of the service I wont be returning
As far as chain restaurants go  Bar Louie is ok I really like their appetizers and their salads  but I dont care for their burgers or pastas Their drinks are ok Theyre normal corporate restaurant drinksie  Applebees  Service is hit or miss Last time I went  I had just fine service The time before that was also just fine Sometimes the server is a little spazzy and seems new or doesnt know wtf hes talking about Once  I went and ordered red zinfandel and he brought me white zinfandel and argued with me that it was red zinfandel I had to explain to him that white zinfandel can be confusing because it is  in fact  pink I still dont think he believed me It wouldve been amusing if it werent for the fact that it was actually annoying   Things I like: calamari  pretzel sticks  wedge salad  some of the sandwiches Things I dislike: frozen burgers they sell for $1  Great to stop in right before a movie at Loews  though : 
My sons a and I came for Tuesday Dollar Burger Night You can gat a burger beef  chicken  portabella  or turkey in a bun with lettuce for a buck Then you can add toppings to complete your burger at a small cost cheese 75 cents  veggies 50 cents  Artery Cloggers 75 cents  sauce 25 cents Those are the headings and they have items listed under them like 9 different cheeses You can also get a basket of tots or fries for a small price as well  My burger was $225 after I added toppings Is it the best burger Ive ever had? No But is it the best $225 burger Ive ever had?  Yes Its kind if a Russian roulette as to how your burger will come to you cooked Mine was well done and one if my sons burger had pink in the middle We probably could have sent it back but we dont mind a little pink  I love the tater tots  They are crispy and have the right amount of salt Yummy Our server was great and well definitely be back
Great environment at night Songs going on very lively The food of my friends who ordered burger and fried shrimps was not that great But I ordered chicken flatbread which was really delicious Absolutely loved it  will definitely go here again just for the flatbreads
I went this evening The chop chop salad was awesome The shrimp tempora was too bready The bartenders were awful
Came here for happy hour and a bite to eat on a Friday evening  They have some great happy hour deals   $3 drafts with a nice selection and half off flat bread pizza I believe there are three or four different types of the flat bread to choose from    My friend and I sat at the bar and I have to say the service was just ok  We werent given plates or silverware with our pizza  the servers didnt seem to know what the other was doing  and it was a bit haphazard  I ordered a burger medium rare that came out so rare I could have milked the cow  However  the tatertots served with it were delicious  Located at the Waterfront across from the movie theater Bar Louie offers both indoor and outdoor seating and is a decent option if you dont want to wait around at the other restaurants Burgatory is directly across from it    This will not be a go to destination for me but it is a decent happy hour choice
Ive had a pretty wide variety of experiences at Bar Louie  Sometimes I go and the service is decent and the drinks are good  and sometimes I go and the service is really slow and the drinks are flat or just plain bad  The one thing that is usually pretty consistent though is the food  Any food that I have ordered has always been pretty good  Ive never had an amazing experience here  but I do still go back for food and drink specials and because of its location near the movie theater
My boyfriend and I came for $1 burger night and the food was delicious I am not a huge bread fan; I usually eat my sandwiches open faced but I loved the buns My boyfriend ordered a $1chicken and a $1burger  and got both chicken That wouldnt be a big deal if the service made up for mistakes We love the atmosphere and taste of food but the service is horrible This review is not based on a one night experience Out of three different times we have experienced bad service  very inattentive Managers need to review the importance of service with their staff  If some one likes you and you are attentive to their needs  they are less likely to complain Bit when you are ignored and they make mistakes  most make it a point to bring it to a managers attention
Sandcastle is a mixed bag for the kiddos  On the one hand  there are plenty of waterslidespools that are a good fit for young riders  on the other hand  Sandcastle  like any city amusement park  attracts more than its fair share of highschool kids looking to spend some time away from their parents and assert their personhood    Unfortunately that element doesnt particularly care about censoring speech for 9 year old ears  and worse  in the Mon Tsunami  about personal space  since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and showing off for the fairer sex  and that can be a little dicey for the littler kids  Having said that  its still a good day at the park   cheese fries  a cool dip in the pool on a hot day  some fun slides     I think in rating Sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park  It is NOT policed particularly effectively  if you take small children you have to be a diligent parent and be aware of your surroundings  paying attention to the group of 17 somethings thrashing around in your near vicinity  accidentally bumping into people for a reaction from their group    MOSTLY its a good time  Mostly
Were lucky to have a waterpark in the Burgh  I have to keep telling myself that when I want to complain about this place  I DO think its a great place to take the fam or even  in my case  spend a day relaxing if you can    Lets do the compliment sandwich  Positive   negative   positive    The negative I feel like Sandcastle is the forgotten redheaded stepchild of Kennywood  They keep pouring money into K wood  but Sandcastle stays the same year after year  Now  granted I havent been there in YEARS  but everything seemed the same as I left it other than one new slide  I havent been there in about 9 years  One new slide in 9 years?  Hmmmmm  I see major places to improve  Especially the pool  I honestly think the slides are great  although you could always add more  theyre still fun  The pool its just packed  So packed that youd think theyd add a second pool  Looking around it looks like they have the extra space  Maybe an adults only pool?  Swimming with 20 zillion kids  plus adults drinking yes I like that you can bring your bevvie in the pool but its kinda weird being around so many kids and you start to wonder how clean the water is  I mean  20 zillion kids you gotta expect a good amount of kiddos are peeing in the pool    The sidewalks are also scalding hot  Id assume since many of the people are walking around barefoot youd be able to custom order some kind of non sun absorbing surface  And Im NOT investing in those dorky water shoes  sorry    Im ALWAYS happy to see a Potato Patch stand  Just as good as K wood  They also serve chicken tender  which is nice if you want a little meat to add on  Nothing more is needed for me  Although the frozen drinks looked tasty and tempting  it was so hot out I was just downing water by the gallons  Youre also allowed to bring in your own snacks and food  which I think is nice for families who want to save a little mola    Again  Sandcastle is so awesome to have in the Burgh  it would be nice to see improvements  It always seems packed in the summer months  so why not keep on improving it?  Or maybe they think dont fix whats not broken  I just may stick to a cleaner  less pee filled community pool for my water fun fix
okay  so its not as fun as kennywood but i guess its still cool   i planned ahead a day to go for me & bobby his first time it was supposed to be nice day  but the weather changed in 2 weeks   we picked a nice time since it was literally supposed to rain all day  there werent any long lines we literally rode every water slide in one hour then we went to head to the lazy river   & it was closed they said it was closed due to not enough attendence  but i mean come on we still paid $70 for 2 people to come in this park where i just rode everything in one hour keep the lazy river open so i can kill an hour aah the cliff hanger was also closed  like always   so we just went and rode everything again the Dragons Den is sweet and the blue tubaluba is as well bobby had a blast on the speed slides i have to admit though  i do miss the regular body slide   another reason i chose august 3rd to go to sandcastle was that the park was open until 7pm rather than 5 or 6 like regular days well actually at 4:45 we recieved a 15 minute warning that the park was closing at 5 due to rain ugh  a little more time wouldve been helpful   i couldnt hear the warning and asked an employee who said they were closing in ten minutes due to the weather and being under staffed to stay open until 7 it started to rain at 5 and literally at 5:20 the rain was over  the park couldve just shut down the rides until the rain cloud passed   but due to being under staffed would rather hand out rain checks which is fine because we get an another entire day  but i mean it would be a terrible inconvience from someone out of town who planned a family day   overall  the smile on my boyfriends face was priceless  but i truly wish we couldve enjoyed the lazy river and the park until 7 hopefully next time things go as planned
So I moved to Pittsburgh from Los Angeles I know I know I know Anyway so theres absolutely no places in Homestead that delivered Chinese so I decided to walk down to the closest Chinese foodrestaurant to my house   The family that runs the restaurant is very friendly I read a review about them on Google that said the  mom looks like she might want to cook you alive Dont believe it  On this visit I ordered the Steamed Dumplingsrecommended by some reviewer on googleTHAT LIAR and the Vegetable Chow Fun I generally enjoy steamed dumplings but these dumplingstoo much dumpling little meat werent so good Theyll probably be sitting in my mini fridge tomorrow and Ill force myself to eat them when I have the munchiesstarving to death The Vegetable Chow Fun on the other hand verrrrrrrrrrrrrry yummy Definately most have next time anyone decides to stop by   But all in all the verdict is you typical Chinese Take Out Place  puts the menu on the fridge
Not bad for neighborhood corner Chinese food The Szechwan is not good Too muchketchup?? The wonton soup is good  Very good curry chicken with onion and happy family  Egg rolls are hit or miss Sometimes they can be a little underdone  Is this the best place? Nobut it does the trick especially for a hangover cure
If I were to describe this place in one sentence I would call it a mediocre  and cheaper version of Bettis 36 on the North Shore  My wife and I won a gift card in a raffle  We went for lunch on a Saturday It was not crowded  We entered the restaurant and were promptly seated by a nice server  The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated and did not feel run down or old in any way  Our server took our drink order and returned promptly  We got the pretzels with beer cheese appetizer and we each got a hamburger  Our food arrived promptly and the appetizer was fine  10 years ago I would have called it good or better but time has marched on and expectations are higher then they once were  The same goes for the main course The fries were unremarkable but decent as were both burgers    The bill was also fair  The meal with two drinks and an appetizer was reasonable for what we got The server was pleasant and attentive All in all this Fridays as a good but likely quickly forgotten experience  I would return here for lunch like I did today
A TGI Fridays is a TGI Fridays You either like it or hate it This location is pretty standard; it has the expected mash up of decorations around the walls that try to give the place a laid back lounge feel and theres nothing outstanding about the menu or what they offer food wise and like other Fridays  its not particularly easy to eat here if youre anything other than a meat lover  Honestly I wasnt expecting to eat here any time soon; I had called a few days before eating here while planning a day out with friends and asked about reservations for a large group as it says on the TGI Fridays website that its ideal to call ahead when you have a large party However  I was told on the phone that this location does not accept reservations So my friends and I looked elsewhere  and finally walked across the street to Fridays after discovering just how darn long the waits at other restaurants were At least Fridays only had a 15 minute wait  Once we were seated our meal went by pretty uneventfully I remember that we had to repeat ourselves a lot to our waitress and I had wondered why she was having trouble hearing us  but at least she was willing to ask questions and clarify things as opposed to taking a potentially wrong order back to the kitchen Kudos The food  as I mentioned earlier  was standard TGIFridays Nothing particularly wrong with it  just not that exciting either I had actually found one of the only low calorie items on the menu at the last minute   a steak and vegetable dish   and standard or not I was honestly pretty happy with it My steak was surprisingly juicy  came out fairly pink and was not overcooked at all Id ordered a medium temperature steak  and the simple and tasty vegetables offered a nice alternative to some of the other excessive dishes I saw on the menu Not that that mattered after I ordered a rum punch cocktail  which mixed so much rum  fruit juice  sprite and other sugary beverages together that my teeth probably rotted a little bit in my head It was worth it  though   that drink was a sweet  tall cup of Heaven  This TGIFridays really fits my exact definition of an a ok place   its not terrible  nor is it not exceptional Its just a decent place to grab a bite or to enjoy a drink Id consider coming back again  but admit that they wouldnt be my first choice so much as a solid back up plan for when other Waterfront eateries are super busy
Service was very slow from the beginning It took a while for us to get our water I ordered a blue raspberry slushie which also took awhile to be served It tasted okay But the mango peach slushie was way better You can change flavours   We got the all you can eat appetizers for $10 but now you can only get refills on the same appetizer you ordered Whereas in the past  you could change the appetizers you ordered  So we got loaded potato skins which was delicious The skin was crispy and the potato was soft and the cheese was so good The bacon bits were crispy   We trie jack Daniels and barbecue boneless wings The jack Daniels were my favourite They were sweet and crispy   The potstickers were very hot when they were first served and after awhile  the skin of the potsticker was just really floury and chewy
This place is kind of a hybrid of Applebees and CPK  which isnt to say its bad  but nothing to rave about either I got their slider meal  which was tiny for me and my friend got their steak which was way tiny The food was fine and the service was okay  but really felt like an Applebees knockoff and Applebees isnt even worth knocking offing anyway   3 stars
Not quite authentic but good enough for Pittsburgh Its the only place that Ive found that even comes close to a classic Chicago style deep dish I also had the french onion soup that wasnt bad The croutons were still crunchy and it had just the right amount of cheese  My girlfriend really enjoyed her Caesar salad and said shed come back just for the salad  Overall  I enjoyed it and would come back the next time I get a craving for a deep dish pizza It wasnt authentic but it certainly was not terrible
Came here on a Monday night  Boy was the place dead  I was the only only Customer at 8:30PM  Ordered a thin crust pizza with extra cheese  pepperoni and mushrooms  It was pretty good  Could of used more cheese   I wasnt in the mood for the heavy crusted deep dish pizza This is my first time at this location but have been to several of the other locations in the US  It was just like the others  The Caesar salad with anchovies was very good  The service was very poor  My waitress spent a lot of time chit chatting with the hostess  It was a chore to get water refills from her    They have big screen televisions in the bar area which can be seen from the restaurant
I ate here at around 8:00 on a Saturday night  Reading the other reviews  it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant I was  Sure  it isnt a world class dining establishment  but it is decent considering it is a chain  You should know that going into any chain  really  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price  We were greeted immediately upon entering  and while the hostess went to grab menus  another server asked us if we were taken care of  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food    My fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it  I had the potato skin appetizer  It reminds me of a baked potato pizza that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo  It was delicious  especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce  Overall  it doesnt even come close to visiting an Unos in Chicago  but then again  when does a copy every live up to the original?  It wont be a regular location in our  dining rotation  but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish  Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago
Well this visit started off good I was seated right away  no wait Was given a good beer selection of some PA Craft beers Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza  but with no onions Now after we ordered  it just went downhill from there Was never asked if I wanted another beer  the waitress just gave me more water My pizza still had onions in it Which I stated right off the bat  that I didnt blame the girl who took my order I know cooks cant read I was one for many years Mistakes happen  and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill NO complaints  still ate the food and it was good Just not a fan of onions on my pizza   Now onto the bill  the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions I already said it was taking care of and theres no worries She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday  and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip  it wouldnt go unnoticed I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry When I hand over the gift card I had on hand  she comes back and again repeats herself  tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesnt have to claim it at the end of the night And again if I felt like leaving her all my money  she would just be so freaking happy Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it No server  and I mean NO server anywhere  should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip  yet alone  do it twice So out of kindness  which I shouldnt have left anything by this point I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for  Bottom line  the food was good for the price  but the service from this one person as I dont know how the rest of the servers are Was just horrible
I think the location in homestead has ruined this place Dirty dirty dirty  Bathrooms unkept  entry door handle and windows filthy  Pizza had too much sauce on it and was drenched Server was coarse  not refined  Serving items were old and rusty Temperature of food was not hot  Low quality  but probably ok with pittsburgher s
Pizza is a staple for me I love everything about crunch crust  a nice rich tomato sauce  and a thick layer of melted cheese I have never tried Chicago style pizza before and when we had to rescue our friends from car troubles  Unos was right there so we decided to try it out   Only a 30 minute wait for a Saturday is pretty good for any restaurant in the Waterfront We were seated at a booth in the bar area The tables were clean and it was a big booth so the four of us were not squished Only complaint  the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud Good news  only happened twice  The four of us decided to order two pizzas  the Pepperoni and the Farmers Market I also ordered a Caesar salad because I needed more vegetables in my life    The salad It was a big salad that I shared with my boyfriend The croutons were huge and very crunchy The Caesar dressing was not creamy  it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a bite to it as Chris kept on saying I thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy  but who am I to say  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like I requested   The main dishes came out about 10 minutes later I do not know what I was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as I was imagining Two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me But I was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection   The Farmers Market pizza had caramelized onions  spinach  SUN DRIED AMAZING TOMATOES  regular tomatoes  eggplant  pesto as a sauce  and a blend of cheeses The crust was perfection being so crisp and light that I stole Chris extra from his plate The sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that I went looking for the slices with the most on them It was a really really good pizza We even ended up taking slices home with us My eyes deceived me at first with the size   Then our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza Cookie pizza? What sorcery is this? Matt  the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed This cookie came out in a really large  bigger than our pizzas  dish It had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream WARM  right out of the oven  fresh cookie pizza Oh sweet heavens  it was good I am glad that I had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness   Chicago Pizza  I would absolutly try again
Last week was my first visit to this place The raspberry tea was amazing We got the app sampler   it was very good except for the homemade guacamole I ordered a side salad  hardly any dressing on it  and not very fresh I ordered the stuffed chicken with broccoli & grilled vegetables  Waited along time for the entrée  The chicken was good but a small portion  The broccoli & veggies were water logged Lots of water on the plate Tried my friends fried shrimp  it was good with good flavor Might have just been who was in the kitchen that night so I would give it another shot
I am glad that Western Pennsylvania has one remaining outlet for the great Chicago style deep dish pizza offered by Uno  its pioneer  Dining here brought back memories of an excellent meal I enjoyed in Chicago last month at Uno subsidiary  Pizzeria Due  The restaurant is attractive and comfortable  and the outdoor seating by the river a delight  The tables outside  though  are too close and if all are occupied  one can hear every word of what is said at neighboring tables  The spinach and chicken pizza  appetizers of zucchini chips and spinach and artichoke dip were all delicious  but the zucchini was extremely salty  Our server was pleasant and attentive  performing many quality checks  $2099 is a lot to pay for a pizza  but the deep dish pies are hearty and plenty for two people $775 for a small glass of house wine is excessive  The $499 tariff for the single serving appetizers was fair for the quality and the portion sizes  The weak link was the young lady who seated us  She was glum  unfriendly  and without a smile  Instead of saying Enjoy your meal when seating customers  she says  There you are  How a customer is greeted can set the tone for a meal and this is an important facet of the front of the house operation At The Cheesecake Factory  the host staff is trained to engage the customer in pleasant conversation while leading the guest to the table The individual at Uno got us off to a poor start  A nice touch would be for a manager to provide a quality check and make the diner feel welcome
This was my first time at an unos in about ten years My kids ordered pizza which was just ok  I however was pleasently surprised with what I ordered  the bbq firehouse chicken sandwich was absolutely awsome  Two big thumbs up for the sandwich  Wait staff was friendly and attentive
Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday   small crowed for 12:30 on a football day   our server was very friendly   took 5 trys before I found a beer that they had in stock but we made it   Im crazy when it comes to craft beers and trying the selection you have but keep them in stock its not that hard anymore   had the 2 for $1299   I had the Chicago classic and Italian salad both out standing salad was very large and pizza was just the right size for a lunch   all in all great place for lunch just buy some beer
Met my family here after work on a weekday Not many people dining here at the time but our dinners seemed to take longer then they should have considering not very busy As we were waiting on our pizza the waitress handed us a trivia game console to use We played 2 games of trivia and the game of life The pizza came and the crust was very dry and not much flavor to it When we were presented with our check we noticed a charge of $199 that we didnt know what it was for  When we asked what the charge was for they charged us for the games that we played on the console that they gave us while waiting for our dinner I have never heard of anything like it I wonder how many people used the games and were charged the fee and paid it without noticing it on the bill considering it was hidden discreetly in the middle of the bill Then when we were ready to pay the bill with cash We couldnt get our server to come and take payment Was very disappointed It will probably be awhile before I go back if ever
I used to come here a lot about 4 5 years ago But then I stopped for one reason or another  I came back again tonight after the long hiatus  and I was disappointed The deep dish personal pepperoni pizza wasnt very good   the sauce tasted bland  the crust tasted oily and a bit overcooked or stale  and there wasnt much flavor to the cheese I havent been feeling well and thought it might just be me  but my husband tried it and said the same thing He also said his chicken parmesan sauce tasted bland  I feel bad   it was a little like looking at an old Taylor Swift album you used to love five years ago  except now you realize the songs were sappy and she looked completely different I used to love Uno  but its not at all what I remembered it to be
Love the stores selection but HATE how the girls chase you around to tell you their sales If I wanted to know Id ask 
If the P stood for Philadelphia and the F stood for Flyers  then PF Changs would make more sense  because this is the most Americanized Asian food I have ever tasted  One of the special dishes offered tonight consisted of chicken  Yukon Gold potatoes  and some sort of sauce  YOUKON GOLD?  Do you eat those potatoes with rice?  My order of Singapore noodles had French fried onions on top  With curry powder I assume it was powder  because the menu promised curry but there was no sauce       The restaurant is half full on a Thursday night  but noisy with at least three decades of American top 40 music blaring non stop  The bar is large  the beer glasses are tall and thin  but theres not  a Tsing Tao or plum wine in sight  This is as US as a place can get       But heres the thing:  the French fried onions are crispy and spicy We order a $500 plate of garlic sugar snap peas and thats exactly what we get:  snap peas stir fried for not more than two minutes in a little oil  a lot of garlic and probably a pinch of salt  This is a fresh  simple  tasty treat and its matched by the broccoli that comes with the broccoli and chicken dish  The sauce is blandly acceptable  but the broccoli is emerald green and abundant         I hate the PF Chang ritual where they mix their own special sauce for you  as though you are incapable of mixing soy and chili paste yourself  Worse  it seems to imply that the food theyre serving will be so tasteless it will need all the help it can get from this spicy concoction  But once the wait staff departs  I just ignore the mess and forget my irritation  Because  much as I hate to admit it  the food  although about as Asian as the plastic chop sticks they distribute  is fresh  tasty and well presented  The staff remembers to re fill the water glasses  Id love to give this place two starts but I keep going back  so I have to give it three  or Im a chump  But Ill be damned if I call it an Asian food restaurant  PS    I probably must mention that Ben Roethlisberger was coming in to PF Changs just as I was leaving  With a good looking woman  Does that increase or decrease the stars to be awarded?
Wasnt terrible  But certainly wasnt great Save your hard earned cash
Went there for lunch and had a decent meal  While the Mongolian Beef was beyond excellent  the Moo Goo Gai Pan was average although I did enjoy the shrimp in it  Service was fine and decor is pleasant  For some reason Im just not in the mood to write a detailed review   please accept my apologies
Ive had PF Changs both in Pgh and KC and honestly  Im never been disappointed nor elated with the food Its upscale Ameri Chinese food You dont come here seeking authentic Asian staples; its all changed to some degree to suit American taste buds nothing wrong with that  imo Do I even know what authentic Chinese food is? Yes  sortuv  somewhat Will I stop putting quotes around everything? Definitely not  It was 45 min from closing time when we party of 6 rushed in on a weeknight; got seated  ordered and ate without feeling rushed by the staff  This particular PF Changs  on the Homestead Waterfront  had fast and friendly service  though he forgot our order of asparagus We sampled everything from the the Szechuan shrimp to the Mongolian beef to the Dan Dan Noodles Good flavors  nothing that stepped out in the crowd  I dont come here all that often but when I do  I invariably leave feeling satisfied and full
LOVE the food Try the bomb pop martini The service has definitely Gone down hill in the past year And when Ive  told the manger he just doesnt give a shit  Its either hit Or miss with service But food is ALWAYS GOOD
First time eating at PF Chang  thought the food was fine but Id rather go to an authentic Chinese restaurant any day It felt like a Chinese version of the Cheesecake factory    Anyway  it was a Saturday  late afternoon  and despite lots of empty tables we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and after that waited 30 min  for our food  I dont know if they were just short staffed the day we went but I wasnt impressed with the service  Some nice items on the menu include the lettuce wraps and the salt and pepper calamari  which comes with a separate dish of salt and pepper for dipping The sesame chicken was also very good  Other things were fine  just not memorable    I think this is an OK place to eat if you happen to be shopping at the Waterfront and dont mind spending a little time over lunch or dinner If you want to get in and out in a hurry  dont come here
I was unimpressed with my food and I am even more sad to see  now that PF Changs mass produces frozen dinners  This is about as far away from Chinese food you can get  unless of course you are eating microwaved warmed shrimp fried rice The restaurant is cluttered and the music was up so loud  I had to yell to carry on a conversation PF Changs in the Waterfront is a unmemorable experience Maybe I would have better luck microwaving my own meal at home?
I have mixed feelings about this place I wish I could give 25 stars  but Im in a good mood so Im rounding up today   This was my first time here and I honestly wasnt sure what to expect The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it Fortunately  there wasnt a long wait as we had made a reservation   We were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were meant to be shared My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Changs Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a heres your sauce kind of way I remember thinking  Thats very nice  but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce There was no explanation   just a little tray of sauces Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild  medium  or hot sauce We picked medium and  with a few scoops  she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didnt know what they were for   Forget the sauce though  my attention was now drawn to our meal For meals that were meant to be shared these sure are little portions I guess when you go for that high end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less The food itself was good in an ok sort of way I cant say it was the best Ive had  but it was good enough   Overall I thought the experience was lacking PF Changs tries to be classy  but does it in a cafeteria sort of way I was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room The music didnt fit the ambiance Our table felt like it was in the middle of the road The restaurant was loud and crowded The girls at the table next to us were taking those annoying duck face puckered lip pictures    I think our experience may have been different if we were seated at one of the booths along the side of the restaurant  but no such luck
Surprised how empty the restaurant was tonight   First time at this location  Great service  but wasnt hard to do  Had a combination Orange Shrimp and Chicken and Chicken Fried Rice  It was typical PF Changs Very good  You can get the Fried Rice off the kids menu for $295 versus $8 for a big bowl off the regular menu
Came out here with my parents to have dinner  I have to say that our meal was all around worth a 4 star rating  but the lousy attitude of the hostess and the man behind the desk who seemed to be in charge quickly lowered that rating    Our food was pretty good  The lettuce wraps are usually my favorite part  and this time it was no different  My moms fried fish peices and veggies was also delicious  However  my $19 Mahi Mahi was pretty much like eating air there was seriously no taste at all  and it was tiny  I found myself adding all the extra sauces on the table just to try to give it some dang flavoring  If I was you  I would order lettuce wraps for an app and lettuce wraps for your meal  If you have room  lettuce wraps for dessert  too  Oh yeah  and to drink  lettuce wraps
Ive heard its very much a chain and that its not at all authentic Chinese food  however despite all that I have to admit the food was good and the service was excellent  There is quite a disconnect with the loud Rock music played in the dining room and the serene Chinese decor  but I figure it works for somebody  I ordered the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli and the meal was quite tasty  The prices are quite reasonable  Just as long as you are not looking for authentic Chinese dishes  this restaurant will definitely serve in a pinch
Still good food but I find that more times than not when we go we have to ask for clean dishes or silverware I have found this whether we are at the Waterfront location or the Robinson location Maybe they need a new contract with a new appliance company
My wife and I came here a few years ago and you couldnt get in the door because of the line This was the hottest new place on the restaurant scene and everyone wanted to try it Fast forward to present day and youd never believe that was ever the case Changs is poorly set up as one large open room thats rather noisy Food came out quickly but was not as good as the Chinese take out we get from sesame inn Spicy chicken was neither spicy nor very flavorful and had a mass produced feel to it Took half home to eat the next day but ended up throwing it out a few days later Normally one of the great thing about getting Chinese is looking forward to the leftovers the next day   Another minus was noticing how dirty the floor was on the way back to the bathroom I dont expect a place to be immaculate in the middle of dinner service but this looked like the mcdonalds on Smithfield downtown The one bright spot was our waitress was very good and kept our water glasses filled We just came from kennywood so we went through quite a few fill ups during our time there Short of this  Id probably give Changs two stars Probably last time Ill stop in here unless I cant get in to any restaurants in the area and need a place I know wont be too busy
First of all  I LOVE pfchangs  but I  recently visited here and had really bad experience The waitress hardly paid any attention to us The hostess had to like help her I even wanted to order a to gobut I couldnt find her  so I just went up to the bar and ordered it  Im a server myself  so maybe I had high expectations but I still tipped her like 12 on 30 I still love it though  Im not gonna be an asshole and say Im never coming back bc I know i will  lol
Food was ok Soup was HOT    The server was nice but my coffee cup was dirty and sugar container had sticky prints of some sauce on the sides Yuk I dont even like sugar with my coffee And how did his shirt get that dirty over lunch Unless he was starting the dinner shift On Saturday even worse But he smiled  brought me a clean cup  and I wiped the sugar container clean pet pev   Otherwise everything else was ok? Some times its the service   A bad server ruins everything  If the server looks unkept  and their station is dirty   I begin to wonder what other aspects of the service I cant see thats neglected    OMG I dont want to think about it  Thank God I only ordered the soup And it was HOT
Since I have foot problems and am limited as to the type of shoes I can wear I generally come here Normally both of your feet are measured for accuracy  Most styles come in European sizes so I am familiar with the size I normally wear  They also sell orthotics which you can put in sneakers or special orthodics for dress shoes If you have a foot problem they will give give you 10% off your purchase of the orthotic once your mention your doctors name  I normally come here for sneakers  sandals and on rare occasion a dress shoe They offer a reward program for the amount of your purchase once you reach a certain threshhold  I have never had a problem with any of my orthotics and give them a high recommendation They do offer trunk shows which was the reason for my recent visit since I needed a pair of summer sandals and a waterproof sneaker for an upcoming trip Normally they sell New Balance for sneakers and their prices are relatively comparable to that which you would find in other shoe stores  However  the do carry some better lines so expect to pay a little more if you want the quality of a name brand shoe You are permitted to purchase the items and try it around the house to see if you are comfortable with it If unhappy then you have two weeks to return it at which point it becomes a final sale  Time will normally tell if I had made the right purchase or not I bought a pair of waterproof sneakers and an Allegra sandal which is versatile They were kind enough to stretch the sneaker to make sure it wasnt bothering my bunion  Located at the Waterfront parking can be a bit difficult but there is usually ample parking in the back of the complex
Had lunch here after getting my nails done in the Waterfront  Its your standard Panera   lots of seating and a sunny room from all the windows  Our food was made very quickly  even though the place was pretty busy lunch on a Saturday  Chicken noodle soup is tasty  but there was too much broth and not enough noodles and chicken  I tried their Sierra Chicken sandwich for the first time  and it was pretty good  Its very flavorful  I like whatever they put in their chipotle mayo  It was a salty meal though   definitely had me running to the fountain machine to get more water  If I have to get a quick  light meal and only chain options are available  Panera is my best choice  Its definitely predictable and usually tasty  But there isnt much special about it  of course
I like Panera bread but this one is a so so I always get my fuji chicken salad in every Panera bread I go All of the other use spring mix to make their fuji chicken salad except this one They just use regular salad and salad doesnt taste or look very fresh either I was kind of excited to find there is a panera bread around us but I am disappointed after trying it Dont know if we will be back again
It seems silly to rate a chain so I wont talk about the food   I just love coming to this Panera because its right by Barnes and Noble  I recently started getting into the Panera card Compared to the other Paneras I have to say that this one seems cleaner  bigger  and all around nicer  Of course I would never go out of my way to get here but if youre at Barnes and Noble and arent happy with the sandwiches there which I was I would venture on over to Panera
In general  I like Panera so rather than reviewing Panerai overall  Im going to compare this Panera store to other Panera stores that Ive been to  Ive been here a couple times and so far  no major complaints in terms of food and service The people are generally friendly honestly  they are probably the friendliest Panera staff Ive seen in all of the Panera stores Ive been to in Pittsburgh  although I havent been to them all Once  I came in after breakfast time and asked for a quiche and they gave it to me without any problems I havent had to wait super long  even if there are a lot of people   However  my biggest problem with this Panera store is that there are hardly any outlets and seating is rather a pain I like to go to Panera to eat and do work at the same time but its rather hard when there arent many seats and very few outlets  Food: 4 stars   just your average Panera food Service: 5 stars   as mentioned  pretty good experience Seating: 1 star   dont come here to work or come with a huge party Overall: 3 stars
Sometimes I use Panera as a lunch place and sometimes I use it as an office Either way I tend to spend a lot of time at Panera If I am meeting someone I prefer to sit in a booth for more privacy I like the homey feel of Panera and love it when I get to sit by the fireplace  The bakery items are always fresh Its nice that they keep the chocolate chip cookies warm Yum The food is unpredictable Sometimes its good and sometimes its not so good The serving sizes on their soups and salads have shrunk considerably in the last year They do have a good selection of food They keep adding healthier options Their recent addition is Soba Noodle Bowls They look good but I sense a lot of sodium hides in them  If you need a place to meet someone to chat or get some work done it is a good place Food wise there are many other choices to consider around the city for better food at the same prices
This Panera Bread location is ideally located in the Waterfront shopping center in the midst of several shops and a large parking lot The space itself is much larger than many other locations I have been to and has ample seating  which is always a good thing Unfortunately  the service is slow and unfriendly there was no line and it took a few moments for someone to notice there were customers trying to order I was surprised that I was automatically given a baguette with my meal rather than being offered a choice between the bread  an apple or a bag of chips Perhaps it is this location  or maybe it was just a one off oversight As I mentioned  there is plenty of seating  but our options were limited because all of the tables were disgusting with trash on them and in desperate need of a wipe down If it were over lunch or a rush  I would be more sympathetic  but there were only a handful of patrons in the entire establishment I was also upset that the WiFi was not functioning Despite my nitpicking  the food was fine and it is a standard Panera  just not a stellar location
It has been several months since I visited Panera Bread It is a bakery cafe chain with free WiFi Prices are reality the same although from time to time they change their seasonal offerings  Food is fair You order and you are given a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready They use real dishes and silverware The menu gives you a calorie count of each item you are purchasing  One of the popular feature items is you pick two where you can have half a sandwich or salad or soup in a pair of two of those items You also get with it a choice of an apple or roll and you can add a dessert for $100  I was disappointed to learn they had removed the French onion soup from the menu I asked about this removal only to learn there was something wrong with one of the ingredients The other disappointment was that this year they are not making gingerbread men which are one of my favorite holiday treats Instead they are offering a holiday themed sugar cookie  I normally eat here when Im in a hurry and dont have time to sit down at a regular restaurant They do use fresh breads and they do cater You can also order your holiday baked goods or breads for your parties
I mean  its Target It has everything You just need to know what to buy there  and not get sucked into the convenience of buying everything in one spot  Beware   though their merchandise looks nice  and its a good buy for a student  you dont want to make long term purchases here The zipper on a skirt I bought broke the first time I wore it Ive heard horror stories about disintegrating comforters during their first wash  That said  their store brand toiletries and other sundry items are fairly cheap  and they have a wider selection than Giant Eagle or CVS They also have a cool program with Flickrcom   you can upload your photos  order them online from Targets One Hour Photo kiosk  and pay by credit card when you pick them up  I love their cheap accessories   glasses  bags  jewelry Along with Claires and Filenes  Target is my favorite place to shop for those things
Its not the greatest Target of all time but it still meets all of your basic needs  If youre looking for produce  lower prices  and bigger selection in every department then head to the Target in East Liberty
