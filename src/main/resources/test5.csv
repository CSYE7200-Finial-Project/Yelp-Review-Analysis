excellent food superb customer service i miss the mario machines they used to have  but its still a great place steeped in tradition
yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend but other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food they also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good i had a banana split they piled the toppings on they win pennysaver awards ever years i see why
all the food is great here but the best thing they have is their wings their wings are simply fantastic  the wet cajun are by the best  most popular  i also like the seasoned salt wings  wing night is monday  wednesday night  $075 whole wings  the dining area is nice very family friendly the bar is very nice is well  this place is truly a yinzers dream  pittsburgh dad would love this place nat
i highly recommend this place the mechanics are really honest and im usually in and out with no issues
i am a big believer in first impressions  so when i go to a new business i pay close attention to how they treat me and how they run their business joe was very polite and friendly as soon as i met him  as was his shop assistant i needed a cv joint installed as well as a new transmission mount joe was nice enough to estimate a fair price to install both  he honored that price  was fast  very friendly  and treated me like he knew me for years its a great neighborhood shop and joe is a real nice guy who could have easily raked me over the coals  but he didnt i know quite a bit about cars  and everything he told me was true hes earned my repeat business immediately give him a call  youll be glad you did thanks joe
thank you rob i truly appreciated all the help i received from this agent today who was able to removed the extra charges on my bill that the pasadena verizon store on lake was charging me on my bill for upgrading my phone   when i went in i was having problems with my blacberry and had to switch to the iphone last week rob from the pennsylvania store who i was connected today was able to look at my bill and all the notes and correct the problem immediately great customer service he even set up a follow up phone call with me on july 5th to make sure the credit goes through on my billi cant thank him enough
this place was delicious  my parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from rick sebaks 25 things i like about pittsburgh and hes usually pretty accurate  his recommendations were to try the reuben  fish sandwich and open faced steak sandwich  we went early afternoon for a late lunch today a saturday and were seated right away  the staff is extremely friendly  my mom  i each had the fish sandwich  while my dad  brother had a reuben sandwich  the fish was very good  but the reuben was to die for  both dishes were massive  and could very easily be shared between two people  on top of being extremely large portions  it was incredibly affordable  the giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant reuben was $750  our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal  we will definitely be back  oh and a bit of advice ahead of time   they take cash only  so come prepared  but im pretty sure i saw an atm there as well  and i do believe they are closed on sundays  mondays
cant miss stop for the best fish sandwich in pittsburgh
this place should have a lot more reviews   but im glad it doesnt  they dont need to get any busier  its been there ages  and looks it if youre all about ambiance  dont bother if you pretend youre in a movie set in pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well the service is sometimes hit or miss most of girls are good  one is very slow  one is amazing they are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that youre happy everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen   busy times it can take a good while to get food   the food is awesome worth any little complaints i might think up before it gets there once its on the table  i forget them all   fish sandwiich  salmon huge and delicious  flounder  shrimp a few ways norfolk style is oily for my taste  and i never had it growing up in norfolk  hawkins st special  prime rib sized for two  watch it  the prices are low  the portions are large  and just about everything on the menu  is delicious im not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food  but if you like a good value and dont want to compromise on taste  this place is a gem
old schooltraditional mom n pop quality and perfection the best fish and chips youll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp a great out of the way  non corporate  vestige of americana you will love it
seen this restaurant on 25 best places in pittsburgh with rick seback ack went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner shes very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty
like a lot of recent patrons  i heard about emils from wqed  the food is spectacular  the owner chrissy and the staff treat you like family  the food is like something your grandmother would make   classic dishes that are always consistently great and memorable
after a morning of thrift store hunting  a friend and i were thinking of lunch  and he suggested emils after hed seen chris sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before  and i had not he said they had a decent reuben  but to be prepared to step back in time  well  seeing as how im kind of addicted to late 40s and early 50s  and the whole rat pack scene  stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burghas long as it doesnt involve 1979  which i can see all around me every day  and yet another shot at finding a decent reuben in da burghwell  thats like hunting the holy grail so looking under one more bush certainly wouldnt hurt  so off we go right at lunchtime in the middle ofwhere exactly were we? at first i thought we were lost  driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway and thenaha here it is and yep  there it was this little unassuming building with an add on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply emils   we walked in the front door  and entered another world another time  and another place oh  and any big burritosousa foodies might as well stop reading now i wouldnt want to see you walk in  roll your eyes and say reaaaaaalllly?  this is about as old world barloungerestaurant as it gets plain  with a dark wood bar on one side  plain white walls with no yinzer pics  good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables this is the kind of neighborhood dive that i could see frank and dino pulling a few tables together for some poker  a fish sammich  and some cheap scotch and that is exactly what i love  ohbut good food counts too   we each had a reuben  and my friend had a side of fries the reubens were decent  but not ny awesome a little too thick on the bread  but overall  tasty and definitely filling not too skimpy on the meat i seriously crave a true  good ny reuben  but since i cant afford to travel right now  what i find in da burgh will have to do but as we sat and ate  burgers came out to an adjoining table those were some big thick burgers a steak went past for the table behind us that was huge and when we asked about it  the waitress said yeah  its huge and really good  and he only charges $1299 for it  aint that nuts? another table of five came in  and wham fish sandwiches piled with breaded fish that looked amazing yeah  i want that  that  that and that  my friend also mentioned that they have a chicken parm special one day of the week that is only served until 4 pm  and that it is fantastic if only i could get there on that week day before 4  the waitress did a good job  especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a saturday  and only one of her she kept up and was very friendly   they only have pepsi products  so i had a brewed iced tea  which was very fresh  and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could as the lunch hour went on  they were getting busy  emils is no frills  good portions  very reasonable prices  very comfortable neighborhood hole in the wallkind of like cheers  but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950s fan freakin tastic i could feel at home here  you definitely want to hit mapquest or plug in your gps though i am not sure that i could find it again on my ownit really is a hidden gem i will be making my friend take me back until i can memorize where the heck it is  addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich excellent truly a pound of fish on a fish shaped bun as opposed to da burghs seemingly popular hamburger bun the fish was flavorful  the batter excellent  and for just $8 this may have been the best fish sandwich ive yet to have in da burgh
from reading the other reviews  i see this place was on some top 25 places in pittsburgh list a few years ago  i havent seen it myself  but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013  it wasnt until my almost 80yo buddy  mr italo donatucci worlds coolest old italian dude brought me one of the best fish sandwiches i ever had that i became hooked  ive had at least 10 since then  but only during the lent season  i gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone  try it without a bun also  either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound  you can have your choice of sides  but i always get the small mac n cheese for my side  the staff is always really friendly and service is prompt  its in a rough neighborhood  but the rankin police station is right across the street  almost every visit there i have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders  soon i plan to make a visit thats not a friday during lent to try other menu items
i love everything about this place the food is delicious yes yes  the fish sandwiches  ok  i agree   but did you try the meatballs?? holy tamoley  i adore the staff  and i love that there are no windows   its its own little hermetically sealed 1950s world of delicious  real food and good people lots of places try to create this kind of ambiance  but it cant be manufactured it takes decades of good food and good vibes  also  the food is really good :
i had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at maximilian kolbe was going to close before i got home on the bus  and i suggested to my wife and 12 year old daughter that we try emils lounge as wqeds rick seback loved the place as did andrew zimmern when he visited for the bizarre foods america episode featuring pittsburgh    the place is in rankin   a rough around the edges town in the mon valley between swissvale and braddock  dont be put off at first   the outside doesnt have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it  a tgi fridays it isnt and thank god for that  the place is well kept but a little dated    no fripperies here  but were not here for the decor   were here for some dinner    the menu is basic with reasonable prices  the meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order  their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  pittsburgh  i love stuffed cabbage but i just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and im cabbaged out  their ruebens are   also killer our waitress raved about them  my wife and i both settled on fish sandwiches  these are true pittsburgh fish sammiches   fresh fried fish in crispy breading  crammed between enormous pillows of soft  yet chewy and crispy mancinis italian bread  no adornments   just a boatload of hot crispy fish  emils uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun  truly a great sandwich  my daughter had the blt   looked good and on good bread and they werent skimpy with the bacon  the service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks  we all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a trivial pursuit game on her iphone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh  overall  if you consider yourself a true pittsburgher   you must visit this place  its one of the few places big jims in the run is another where the spirit of pittsburgh is alive and hungry  please go
we have been coming here for over 30 years  consistantly good food and friendly staff vwey reasonably priced and large portions the owner  chrissy has taken what emil started years ago and built it into a place we will return to again and again favorites are the fish and burgers  hard to pick one
we had gone to the frick mansion for a tour and i told my friends we were stopping off for a lunch in rankin there wasnt much enthusiasm about the location but the reluctantly agreed  we stopped in front and my wife said we arent going in there are we? well once the order the food and enjoyed the best reuben   fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold the owner came over and thanked us for stopping she is a real asset to the place the restrooms were spotless  which important to my wife i have taken places where she had to hover  over the commode i went back two days later for the hulushki a real gem a perfect place to eat real comfort food dont forget the liver and onions
excellent fish sandwich  wonderful reuben sandwich  even the stuffed cabbage tastes homemade   chrissy  is a delightful hostess and makes you feel welcome  restaurant personnel are pleasant   i really enjoy visiting emils when im in town   my only regret is that they are closed mondays   worth the trip
awesome drink specials during happy hour fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious  wing night on tuesday and thursday
grew up near here the family would always go once a month havent stopped in for a few years until last friday with a few friends to grab a drink the sandwiches are always amazing just as i remember the staff is amazing and friendly great place for lunch as well
let there be no question: alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades try a burger on italian bread the service is flawlessly friendly  the food is amazing  and the wings? oh the wings but its still about the cheeseburger the atmosphere is inviting  but you cant eat atmosphere so go right now grab the car keys you know youre hungry for an amazing cheeseburger  maybe some wings  and a cold beer easily  hands down  the best bar and grill in pittsburgh
the sandwiches  the wings  enough said alexions can best be described as a home style primantis before they went mega commercial you really cant go wrong  but for my money  i would put alexions fish sandwich up with the best ive had thats not to take away from other selections  but if you come here i recommend not leaving until youve had either the fish sandwich  reuben  or wings   youll know youre in a pittsburgh bar when you walk in for someone who lives in atlanta now and only makes it to pittsburgh a few times a year  i have to say it is refreshing feels like home i havent had a trip back without making it out to alexions at least once
friendly staff  good food  great beer selection  and relaxing atmosphere great wings and the buffalo chicken pizza is the best ive had the sandwiches are all on thick cut italian bread and fresh definitely  a hidden gem of the greetreecarnegie area looking for a low key hole in the wall with good prices and great food this is your place
found this place on yelp and glad we did great beer selection  the sandwiches are wonderful and huge  wings were very good family owned establishment and everyone we met was great  the owner  waitstaff and kitchen staff  if we ever get to the pittsburgh area again  we will go back
awesome experience   i came in all fatalistic with my flat tire on a workday morning with a full schedule   they saw me and worked on my car like a nascar pit crew  i was prepared to buy new tires  they offered to look to see if they could repair  they repaired them  i saved alot of money  integrity greatcustomerservice
our cat went out the other night and must have gotn into a fight he was wounded but we could not tell the extent of his injuries my girlfriend called them today and they made an appt for us immediately  when we got there  i couldnt believe how friendly and caring they all were we went into the exam room with doctor tierney kelley and a vet asst sam they were the best so gentle and caring they did not pressure us into any procedures that my cat did not need they worked hard so we didnt have to leave him over night this was by far the best veterinarian i have gone to in all my years as a pet owner this has all become a racket for making money doctors dont care about the animals in 90% of the places you go  but greetree animal clinic is not one of those places i will be taking my other pets there from now on and recommend this place and doctor kelly to everyone i know thank you so much again if you read this doctors kelley youre the best
greentree animal clinic is the absolute best  we have had both dr mann and dr reuther  both are very good  each in their own strengths  i recently had to have my beloved dog euthanized due to a tumor growing on his hip  dr mann was very sensitive and caring to my feelings of loss  he offered to make a clay paw print from my dog after he passed  he went above and beyond to make sure he had a peaceful passing with me by his side  thank you for allowing me that experience  and for guiding me through the process
i cannot praise this place enough i have worked as a vet tech in a previous job and have had experiences at numerous facilities here in pittsburgh and greentree animal clinic blows them all out of the water key things that you should note about this place:  they do not over charge  they only recommend servicesthings that they genuinely believe will help your pet  not their bottom line and they do not pressure you in any way  they are respectful and genuine to you and your pet which is hard to come by nowadays  everyone from the front desk to the techs  to the vets are kind  patient and understanding no condescension or poor attitudes  just positive vibes all around   dr brown goes above and beyond any vet ive ever met he has shown so much care  professionalism   kindness and knowledge that i will gladly refer anyone with a pet to him because i know they will be in good hands and his fellow vets dr reuther  dr kelley  and dr mann  are just as phenomenal   thankyou greentree animal clinic for setting the bar where it should be for all veterinary care facilities
beautiful restoration of the library and music hall   look forward to coming here for shows
great people great service great products always busy
this sns and the one in bethel park are my two favorites  staff always friendly and the deli staff in both locations are great  in my experience  if teen staff dont know where something is  they ask another staff member  shopping these two stores is as pleasant as it gets
i went to rossis for my first time  two weeks ago i had two suits and one jacket tailored everything was ready in less than two weeks these suits were brand new and on the expensive side i didnt know who to trust them with i went to rossis because a friend highly recommended them my friend had a tuxedo custom made by rossis   i am extremely happy with the end results  i wanted a european cut on jackets and no break on the slacks; a nice tailored look the suits look awesome im going to go through my closet and take some of my older suits to be tailored some of my older suits are a little looser fitting; i now like the more tailored european look juliano the owner will shorten the length of my jackets  take the sides in and shorten my slacks theyll look brand new  as for the price  im very happy i wouldnt go to the cheapest barber in town for obvious reason i feel the same about a good tailor as for the service  they couldnt be nicer   thanks for a job well done

if you are searching for a go to fish place for lentlook no further  this place will give you the best fish sandwich in pittsburgh  the sandwich has enough fish to make four sandwiches  you will not be able to finish this sandwich in one seating enjoy
this is a great little gem  on my last visit to pittsburgh i was looking for a nice barpublounge to grab dinner and watch a penguins playoff game  a friend of mine who lived in the area recommended rockys  as i walked in the door i was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table it was clean  welcoming and the lounge was busy it was friday night and the special was the fish fry  i ordered the fish and in the meantime i sipped on a draft brew  the order was delivered to my table in no time  the fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large as i was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner i noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes  well needless to say i got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake  another good choice  at the end of night the penguins couldnt pull off the win over the rangers but i definitely have a new go to when im in town  another star could be added for a smoke free environment  i dont smoke but i understand they have a nice outdoor area for those who do
italian dinners  american  endless soup and salad bar is great most food for your dollar i highly recommend great bar good place to watch a game the bar can get quite noisy in the evenings  but it adds to the great atmosphere at rockys
stick to basics and this is the best place in or around the burgh  first time go with a friend and sit at the counter  short order cooking at its best  its like a floor show with the actors backs to you  breakfast has no losers  eggs  omelets  pancakes  waffles  breakfast sandwiches to order  the ever popular mixed grill  get a 12 louie instead of home fries although they good as is and dont forget the italian toast  frequently voted the best burger in pittsburgh for a reason  as for ambiance  well lets just say i dont think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint  but the coffees good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good  andlocal with many long time folks working here  if i dont get there for awhile i need to go through detox because i feel too healthy
cheap  unpretentious  and  for this  one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country  simply put i love it here  the mixed grill  the sausage and egg on a biscuit  the home fries  this it the very definition of diner  thank you gab n eat
okay  lets first set expectations  this place is a true divethis is not for the nyc foodie crowd  if you want a down home  large portion awesome breakfast  this is the place  the place is packed with happy diners  the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way  the best part   they have dippy eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order  for anyone who has never heard of a dippy egg   this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them  the eggs were great   i ordered mine over medium  the breakfast potatoes were fab   no complicated additives like peppers or onions   just plain good potatoes cooked in fat   the best part   the fresh italian bread  yum
ive lived in pittsburgh for 6 years  and in carnegie for over 2 years  and by far  this is the best greasy spoon joint ive found if you can stomach the wait no reservations  naturally  youll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness  thanks to the well seasoned griddle where all of the food is made   here are the highlights:   cheap: breakfast for two can be well under $10  with lunch around the same  crowded: get there early and expect to wait they close pretty early on the weekends too oddly  at 12:45pm  cash only  huge portions: when ordering fries or homefries  always get the half order  unless youre a lumberjack  about those homefries: theyre often undercooked ive had better  believe me my favorite things to eat in life are potato products  my favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick italian toast  with cheese  lettuce  tomato and mayo
love this place  never had a bad meal  good portions and great people  be ready to stand in line
my favorite breakfast place  have good sandwiches also  stopped again for bfast and had the mixed grill get the small portion unless you are a real man  mixed grill has sausage  could it be riccis?  eggs  onions  and home fries  soooo goooooooood  use mancinis bread for toast  got the raisin toast   yum    have had many other items and just love the food  if you like to watch a true cook  sit at the counter  banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun  lunch is good  sausage sandwich  hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill  gets busy for bfast so you may have to wait  remember it is a diner  dont expect fancy decor
great breakfast place come hungry look for dick  my dad  and gino at the counter every am about 0830 and say hi try the mixed grill half
best diner in the counrty weve been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  gab and eat the best rating  i was a little intimidated when i first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill  if you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you  but everything i ate was clearly the opposite of healthy  after trying like every meal they have i would recommend the mix grillhalf unless you are sharing adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast  burgers are great too  its hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home  but this place does it  the atmosphere is classy  old school americana
best french toast ever love the friendly atmosphere  and especially the breakfast never been disappointed you have to try french toast with raisin bread too yummy
great diner  their breakfast is the best in the area  lots of  choices and always good  love the unique mugs they use for coffee and all the writing on the wall  get there early otherwise you will not get a seat  they have homemade hotsweet sausage and texas toast
readers of my reviews may recall that i once referred to the dor stop as possibly the best breakfast in pittsburgh  well  faithful followers  i must now admit that the dor stop has now been verified as only one of the best  why?  thats because gab and eat i have now found to be the best breakfast ive ever had  if it was closer to my home i would quickly become a regular  i easily decided to order the mixed grill half  before i go on  i must askhas anyone seen a full order?  because i honestly cant imagine how much food that is  i created my own with bacon  cheese  eggs and potatoes  based on reviews i also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if i wanted hot or sweetor one of each  i like variety  so i jumped on the change to try both  i also selected the italian toast   what other kind is there  really?    when my food arrived  it looked delicious  there was so much bacon that after eating half of my mixed grill it looked like id barely started  the sausage was great  just dont ask me which one i liked best  my toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides it was a struggle  but i was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb     in case anyone is wondering  yes  they use real butter  i saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes  the wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people  the fact that none of the plates match and i noticed a sign at the front register that said  we need mugs just makes me love this place even more  a few tips: 1 order the mixed grill  2 cash only  3 gab and eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow or cozy if you will  i recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group  that way you wont feel rushed or crowded  4 get to gab and eat asap  youll be glad you did
classic breakfast joint  grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall  window is opaque due to the grease so you cant hardly see inside on the outside  there are about a dozen people waiting to get in  when you finally do get inside  you see that there are 15 tables and a counter  all occupied by people from all walks of life  whats the attraction behind this flea hole?  the food  lots of it and dirt cheap  i sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill  potatoes  eggs  sausage  bacon and italian toast  a giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover  i swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food  neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease  all that food  plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks  cash only  so put that plastic away  only bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the food network or travel channel will make this place famous  and then ill never be able to get in
best breakfast in carnegie pa
best breakfast spot in the area  if you like diner food it is the place to go small  so you will want to avoid the church crowd on sundays  but the wait is never too long  everyone is friendly and has obviously been working there for a while  if you are feeling like lunch food go a little later  their burgers are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious
i always love a good diner  gab and eat was just what we were looking for on a saturday morning  good food  great people pittsburgh ambiance   this place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem  i had french toast and bacon  the french toast was made with the best italian bread  my fiance had what they called a mixed grill  it consisted of eggs  peppers  onions and home made sausage  not something you would eat everyday  but he loved it   they also had great coffee  they actually ground up the beans in front of us  now thats fresh  we want to return sometime for turkey day  apparently they made fresh turkey every tuesday  now that sounds good  cant wait to return
this is exactly what a breakfast place should be like comfortable  quirky  unpretentious and with inexpensive  large portioned working class breakfast plates
on our current road trip of baseball  brews  hockey and diners  we decided to try gab  eat based on yelpers rating putting it 1 for breakfast in pittsburgh area we have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat we arrived around noon on saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables the place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it there is plenty of parking inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs  posters most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers we regretted not having a marker to add ours the other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions   fun way to spend time waiting for food the waitstaff there isuh  experienced they are attentive  pleasant and efficient after reading reviews i had to try the mixed grill but s went with pancakes with a side of bacon the pancakes were outstandingmaybe the best either of us has eaten they were thick but with light texture and rich flavor  his bacon was cooked just as requested   as crisp as possible   and very flavorful the mixed grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs  potatoes  onions  peppers  cheese  and spicy italian sausage grilled together im glad i heeded those who stressed going with the half size order it filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order i couldnt finish it all and thats rare how do they serve the whole potion   in a trough? everything was cooked well the sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes you can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix my only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain i like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill these potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning personal preference it usually comes with italian toast but they were out so i went with raisin it was delicious soft inch thick slices coffee was excellent and the cup stayed full the total was less than $15 fabulous value for the quality and portions while i cant say its the best breakfast in pittsburgh only here 3 days  its the best so far and one of the best weve had
this is a perfect example of what a breakfast diner can be: excellent breakfasts in huge portions for cheap i had the western omlet and will be getting it or another omlet again soon  the coffee was good  totally serviceable diner coffee the waitress was wonderfully friendly and hopping around from table to table the food was excellent the ambience was exactly right for a diner it was packed the wait was not nearly as long as i was expecting 10 minutes maybe  totally recommended come hungry
wow read the great reviews and i was not let down huge portions the mixed grill was the best breakfast ive ever had if you go to pittsburgh it is a must eat service was superb friendly staff led zeppelin on the walls what else could you ask for?
i have been coming to gab n eat for almost 20 years and they have never let me down i get a typical breakfast if eggs  ham  toast  and home fries delicious as usual the ambience however is usually lacking the walls are dark  with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place pictures of local people hang on the wallsi secretly want mine up there along with posters galore while its fun to look at the first 10 times  it gets a little boring after awhile so today when i arrived i expected the same old experience wow was i wrong as soon as i looked at the door i knew something was different the place seemed lighter and brighter to my pleasant surprise  they painted and got new counter tops theyre not quite done yet but the place has a new happy vibe to it the awesome breakfast  the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why i will be back maybe for lunch
a gem the coffee cups are mismatched  the owner is three feet away from me cooking the sausage is made for them locally and the food is frickin awesome i had the pancakes  my daughter had the sausage and egg sandwich  cash only  friendly service
excellent breakfast and lunch menu friendly staff and super food modest environment with excellent food worth the wait dont miss this one  best breakfast and lunch food in the pgh south hills hands down
what a find i stopped in here for breakfast while in town for business the service is so friendly i thought i was down south the service was quick  frankly and felt like i was with family  fantastic poached eggs  cajun homefries and crispy bacon gab and eat is definitely a place i world recommend to locals i was stuffed and the bill was only $800
been coming here for a decade or so whenever my wife and i get the chance  and have never been disappointed  the perfect blend of non chain tightly packed ambiance friendly older waitresses who have been there since i started going  cheap for what you get prices  and food with taste and amounts that aunt bee would be proud of  never had anything that wasnt hot freshly made before my eyes and down home gooooooooooood as andy might say  as my wife and i agree this joint  has been for some time now the overall gold standard by which our eaten out breakfasts have been measured against  one visitand you will be a believer  and most times ive been there the owner is cooking at the grill herself
a fine breakfast joint you gotta love the small diners highly recommended
gab n eat is the best breakfast in pittsburgh and always a treat  we went there around 11:30 which brought up the lunch vs breakfast debate i saw another customers soup and knew i would have to try it the soup was a  lobster bisque and it was amazingcreamy deliciousness i could have had a quart of it yum  i ended up ordering the create your own mixed grill when at gab n eat you have to order the 12 grill i had mine with bacon bacon was crisp and delish and m ordered the regular mixed grill we also shared an order of potato pancakes they even brought us 2 sides of applesauce and sour cream the pancakes could have been a tiny bit crisper  but still very good
great food  great service  and a great diner atmosphere  its the kind of place that allows you to decompress and enjoy good conversation with friends
one of my favorite breakfast stops in pittsburgh cant beat the hometown feel of this place always had great service
one of those places you only hear about from a friendtucked in a strip mallonly open for breakfast and lunch the local atmosphere surpasses the food and thats a helluva compliment    mixed grill is the choice for breakfast  they will mix and match meats and how you want your eggs along with toast   their burgers are up there with the best in pittsburgh   a hidden gem dont miss it
what a great diner  yummy food  friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere  this is a place you have to try  then you will keep coming back
the best breakfast place by far i never even liked breakfast food until trying their eggs and french toast
great greasy spoon  arrived early  around 7:15 am on a weekday had no trouble finding a seat just as we were sitting down  a waitress asked if we wanted coffee of course  and how lovely  we had a couple of questions about the mixed grill sizes because we didnt want too much  as the reviews here stated that the portions were huge the waitress was super nice and answered all of our questions we ended up splitting the half sized mixed grill  and it was plenty  great diner quality  but i think ill try the same dish without the cheese next time it was an american cheese  and i dont think the grill needed it   coffee was always hot  and service was so quick this place is a hot spot  cash only   be prepared
wonderful omelets  coffee  and staff the prices are great and the food is prepared quickly veggie omelet with cheese is my favorite
they have done it again excellent little establishment with their home town feeling mix match coffee mugs  smiling waitresses  open front diner kitchen feel went in there in the mood for lunch while my date was craving breakfast its a seat your own kinda establishment  so we found a table at the very far back  sat down and were greater right away and asked if we wanted coffee to start out mornings agreed and both cups were promptly filled and re filled as the meal went along without hesitation i ordered the hot italian  had fried salami and bologna on it with cheese  dressing  and lettuce bun was a smidge small for all the goodies in it but whats to complain about there?  my date got the bagel sandwich and hey rayed it adding breakfast potatoes and cole slaw it was amazing and large enough that she now has lunch as well i also got a cup the chicken poblano soup  pretty fantastic always a great place to travel to  always a good story to listen to when ya strike up a convo with the locals  always great and friendly highly recommend
this place is great best ham and cheese inlet ive ever had their burgers are also delicious nice flat top crust on the burger i only wish they were open for dinner too
this place is by far the best place for breakfastbut todayi decided to get lunch only because it was lunch timebut they do serve breakfast at this time  too i got the turkey club on wholewheatomgit was delish  too much for me to eat because it came with a large plate of home made french fries  if you are really hungry and dont count caloriesmake a stop here
barbs country junction gets a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a pittsburgh restaurant should be  in addition to being the apple of my nostalgias eye  it is also the constant thought of my tummy when im hungry on the weekends    barbs breakfasts cannot be beat  but truly any meal you get there you wont regret  everything is made to order  with fair portions  and great prices my recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee  theres nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandmas kitchen  i know that gab n eat is nearby  and barbs can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of carnegie that youve gotta try
great little place treats you like a localeaten here 3 times a week for a month  same overtime barb is always here
this is a great place to eat and everyone is so friendly i live right down the street from here but unfortunately  i have only gone a once trust me  i will go here more often the food is great  prices are low  and the staff are friendly my cousin and i wanted a place to eat and catch up and this was perfect place i will go here more often
tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful
i have said it on other sites and will repeat here you must try their burgers they are juicy and delicious with a bun that is perfect another must are the fries with guinness gravy and if you havent had enough go for the ultimate sleeper  leek and potato soup authentic black  tans harp and murphys on tap it dont get no better this is a true gem my friends
new to area and decided to pay this shop a visit it was definitely the best experience ive ever had with a tailor he is much cheaper than the other shops  he charges 10 while others charge $15  and he goes above and beyond for what he charges  i dropped off 4 jeans  and he hemmed and tapered the jeans i couldnt even tell the difference between the store bought jeans and the quality of his work it was absolutely perfect  no bulges or puckers they the match the exact stitch as the factory   absolutely a great guy  they were all done and waiting for me as promised ill definitely be taking all of my business to this place  and would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a personal tailor who actually cares about his work and building an honest business
i needed alterations done to my suit very quickly like three days quickly not only did filberto at alteration world have it ready  the price was beyond reasonable and the work was excellent i plan on bringing all my clothes to him from now on  oh and he let me know that they also dry clean wonderful shop
this is the best alteration place i have been to the guy that owns it is extremely helpful and works fast also  the prices are so reasonable i wonder how he stays in business he was able to do an alteration on short notice and was very acommodating the alteration i needed done and fast was right in the middle of prom season all the other places i called gave me a several week wait  but he took me right away i will be back
i just needed a broken zipper replaced on my favorite penguins fleece jacket and a pair of suit pants hemmed  the price was very reasonable and the work done was great  i will go back for all my tailoring needs and highly recommend if you need any done
so happy i found this place im new to the pittsburgh area and wasnt sure if it was worth driving to carnegie to come here  but yelp convinced me it was completely worth the trip since it would have been a long trip to come back  the guys at alteration world finished my work patching a hole on a pair of jeans in less than half an hour i killed time at an adorable coffee shop across the street and exactly as i had specified oh  and the price was extremely reasonable as well thanks yelp for another great find
my bridesmaid dress alterations were perfect i would not hesitate to come back for alterations or dry cleaning
the service  quality  and speed of alteration world are incredible i have had suits and pants altered here and have been thoroughly impressed by the work everything has fit perfectly and the work was quality i will be returning here exclusively for my tailoring needs and have referred many customers already if you need anything altered or even something custom made  do not hesitate to go to alteration world
i really dont understand these reviews  i have used greetree auto body for years and they have been absolutely wonderful  they are a preferred shop with most insurance companies and it is because they do very good work at reasonable prices  i would highly recommend greentree auto body to anyone
its deep fried garbageits los cmon what do you expecthowever i have never had better  friendlier service at a fast food restaurant
all i need to say is that my 6 year old could not wait to see dr weinberg and her staff not only are they professional and kind   they have made my child have a life time of good oral health care  this busy mom loves that they can provide two appointments  at the same time  i cant imagine having a better family dentist
just moved to the area and needed a dentist after getting my front tooth chipped playing hockey  she did an amazing job at fix my tooth and cleaned up the front teeth while doing it  i was able to get in and have my tooth fixed within a few days of it happening  ive gotten a few fillings as well after my chip was fixed  the doctor is great and so are the staff  i would recommend going here
the crew at west penn dental centers is fantastic  im always greeted with a smile at the front desk and everyone working there is very friendly  dr steines is an exceptional dentist and every one of the hygienists that have cleaned my teeth are exceptionally personable and well skilled at their craft  the practice is small but clean and cozy  a previous review claims that its in a shady part of carnegie  this couldnt be further from the truth  the office is on a nice street with a large parking lot just off of main street  they also provide easy scheduling with email  text confirmations so you dont forget your appointment  i highly recommend west penn dental
good quality work and really nice staff they definitely dont treat you like a number
the office has been in carnegie forever i have been going there for years and have always had good direct communication about anything i need my questions are always answered and i will continue with my dentist as long as hes there
perfect time with hubby  after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal  waitress was such an adorable girl her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great job strawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :  strawberry milkshake  nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering its always nice when u go late at night like us  it is not crowded  not noisy  nice music playing and always nice people around  if you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say dennys
this location never disappoints food is always consistently great  and if you come at the right time  witching hours you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back and it is awesome  love this place
excellent food   good service too i have had several different dishes here and all have been excellent
i like the food at dennys more than meals served at pricier restaurants my favorite is the bourbon chicken skillet even though it isnt advertised as being gluten free  it doesnt have any ingredients containing wheat  just chicken  potatoes  and broccoli in a yummy jack daniels sauce both eat n park and max and ermas have gone downhill in the past few years  but the food at dennys has gotten better
as a member for now 8 years i can honestly say  i have never had a negative experience at amerifit  the owner and staff could not be more accommodating and strive for member satisfaction  the owner not only runs the business but personally fixes machines when needed  interacts with the members  and also personally salts and plows the parking lot when needed in the winter himself   there is another review on here stating the lot didnt have any attention after which was the largest ice storm weve had in years i would like to state i was sitting by the counter the day this lady came in upset and unnecessarily yelling at the front desk employee about the lot  the owner was out there every couple hours doing the best he could to tame the condition of the lot however on that day i believe everyones car on the road turned into a snow sled including my own  if you truly felt in danger being on the roads that day  you probably should of just stayed at home or a work i love the fact the owner takes pride in his business and is extremely hands on with the maintenance of the building  amerifit has such a welcoming  no intimidation  home like feel which is what i believe makes this place so special and unique and has kept my loyal membership for the last 8 years
i brought my husband and my parents all to papa js last time my husband and i were in pittsburgh my parents are really picky about their italian food  usually they drive places in east bumf tarentum  ligonier to get their capital i talian  my pop is kinda grumbly  and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth the only reason i got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport  well  my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot  considering he lives in murrysville   the first good sign dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open  it was noon a few days after christmas second good sign was that dad ordered wine  at it was only 1 pm dad  while not a teetotaler  rarely has a drink before 5 pm so i know he was anticipating a good meal the kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal   can i say  i live in texas now and i still relive this afternoon back in december? i had chicken picattait was perfect my dad had eggplant rollatini  my mom had a pizza  and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara it all was amazing  delicous  and inexpensive in austin  you cant get a decent italian meal  much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people  i know there are so many good italian places in pittsburgh but i just think back so fondly on this daywhen me dad liked someplace i took him :
papa js is by far my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh  my hometown  i eat there almost every time i visit  and everything ive ever ordered has been fantastic  fresh ingredients  simple preparation  reasonable prices  also  they make the best pizza in town hands down
this place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food  and couldnt think of any place we wanted to eat papa js measures up to our expectations with great salads  bead and wine im partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers  ravioli  fish  white pizza i like the space with exposed brick walls there are knowledgeable servers sometimes it is a bit loud  more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby but dont get the wrong impression  its a great place consistantly great food
great  authentic  classic italian restaurant in one of the most unlikely places   i grew up eating here and make a visit nearly every time i come to town  try the fried calamari roman style for a little kick
what a wonderful surprise found in carnegie pa  just south of pittsburgh  i was in town on business with a couple co workers and after having a not so great meal the night before  we asked one of the locals for a recomendation  they told us to try this little italian place called papa js and boy did they send us to a great place  first off  when you walk up to the place  the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside  you can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door  i am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used  while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern  almost as if it had been freshly updated    the server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked  the three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things  so we began with a margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect  they obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and i dont think this pizza could have tasted any better  then came bowls of italian wedding soup which was pretty good  of everything there  this was the one item i probably could have done without  not that it was bad  but there was nothing particularly special about it    we also ordered the garlic rolls not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal and they were to die for  crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside  these things were a meal by themselves  one of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce which is fresh made there  not out of some can and he was right  as if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough  dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better    by the time our meals came  we were all pretty full  but we pushed on and continued to eat  i had the veal parmigiano which was tender and very good  it came with a side of pasta which i tasted just to try and it was excelent as well  had i not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre meal stuff  i certainly would have finished it  as it was  i ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal    one of my co workers had the chicken picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well    they had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle  overall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere  i dont really know how expensive the area is for food  but coming from the chicagoland area  i fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable  the three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol  fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price  who could ask for more  my only complaint is that i had to return to chicago and i am now craving to return to papa js  i hope work sends me out here again sometime soon
delicious  everything ive ever had here was great  the white pizza is a must  always amazing  im also a big fan of the chicken piccatta  the bread that they bring to the table is delicious too  they have a wide variety of selections on the menu and they also have nightly specials that always sound great  their prices are also reasonable  overall  i highly recommend this place
2nd times a charm this place was 35 starts the first time i came  but stepped up large tonight  waitress was righteous and very fun  food was all excellent  caesar salad tasty got with tomatoes big $ on that  fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor  cant wait for the leftovers  the white pizza is that star though  the crustdough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf  i dont throw those accolades out easily  especially on pie  but this joint serves it up  good vibe  great service  phenomenal food  ill be back
i love this place the food is always so fresh and delicious the staff is always friendly  as well
it was just what we were looking for the service was great my husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size it was great spicy and enough for a meal i had the stuffed eggplant that was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier i would definitely go back really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back
some of the best chow around love this place the bread and salads and soups are great
finally  great tuscan style italian food in pittsburgh  not that tasteless stuff that locals think is italian  the bread was warm and fresh the bolognese sauce was creamy and rich  and unlike most restaurants was made with veal i love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant  im looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options  and next time  im saving room for dessert the display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing
wonderful food some items a little over priced but never disappointed  i have friends that love the white pizza i have seen two people eat their weight in the stuff  i love their fresh salads huge the house dressing is perfect every time we have been there many times and it just doesnt get old  we always have the beans and greens the meatball appetizer is superb by pass the chicken parm  its the only thing we have ever found lackingits just really plain the alfredo is excellent  we  almost never go anywhere else in carnegie because we like this place so much
we came to carnegie to check out the black lamb consignment shop lucky for us that we also discovered papa js we loved it the fried calamari appetizer was excellent  as was the fettuccine carbonara well be headed back to this place as often as we can for a real italian dining experience
this is it my favorite in the pittsburgh area   i moved out of the area for 10 years and this was the first meal i had back there was a table of italians speaking italian behind me   how much more authentic can you get??  i bring all of my out of town guests here and not one had been left disappointed my recommendations are to order the mozzarella carozza or however its spelled and then one of the specials if you arent into a special  youll be fine   order off the menu but the specials are typically amazing   when my better half was living 4 hours away  he drove into town and i made him get back in he car to go here instead if complaining  he asked if we could take his parents next time
stopped in for lunch after i got lost due to construction in the area was trying to go to a different place glad the pizza gods were looking out for me ordered a caesar salad with anchovies and a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms the salad was fresh and excellent dressing was made fresh and the anchovies were top notch there is a wide variety of anchovies when it comes to quality and they use excellent ones there was also plenty of them as usually you get a sparse amount the large salad was more that enough for my wife and i they serve a bread basket with two styles of bread pepper cheese and a standard italian with a harder crust they were both so good i purchased a loaf of each on the way out price per loaf was only $4 no way they make profit on the pepper cheese loaf best value in bread in quite some time i will stop in for the bread whenever i am in the area the pepper cheese i would rate a 95 out of 10 the italian was as good as it gets i am a pizza snob and getting a good review from me is tough i am so tough i do not review if i think its bad there pizza is excellent and i would recommend it to anyone remotely close to the place i would ask for a little less sauce i would call it almost ny style slightly thicker crust i asked the waiter if i should order it well done and he said order it as is he was correct and it came out perfect   the waiter and staff were excellent and they informed me that they do not even own a microwave
yummy yum  let me get me some  this place rocks went here with the wife and had a great dinner  portions are very generous and the food is delicious  be prepared to pay top dollar though for the entrees  but they are worth every penny
great restaurant had the eggplant parmesan and it was very good bradley was our server and he was on top of things all the time prices are reasonable and the decor is inviting cant wait to go back
one of my favorite places in pittsburgh  reasonable prices  delicious food  only one weird quirk   they dont bring the delicious fresh bread until you order   but it is complementary sometimes they will if you ask nicely  but it doesnt come automatically   everything is super fresh   my friends  i always order a salad or two as a starter they are huge  dont offer side portions   i strongly recommend the panzanella salad    then  any of the pastas seriously  they are all good    if you remember to save room for dessert   the cakes are all giant  definitely enough to share probably with a large table
i have never posted to yelp before  but in light of the very unpleasant experience had by our friend katie  i figured id share a happier one i love the food  the prices are great and i think im addicted to their cheesesteaks the staff is always funny and down to earth  they make delivery to my job speedy  and they even deal with my indecisiveness haha if something was wrong with my food  i am sure theyd waste no time fixing the problem i always order a side of fries as theyre huge and taste like potato patch kennywood uhh may ziiing i would and do definiteley recommend capri pizza  please note   i do not stand in opposition to katie  i really am sorry to hear of the unhappy experience  but i will say that i really do like capri and i appreciate their staff
friendly staff  same starbucks fair you get anywhere else  sometimes the lines can get long
great location  close to shops and theatre  nice staff
this starbucks is 5 star friendly the shift supervisor lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light he recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should   patience  kindness  generosity and fairness i left that afternoon loving starbucks even more than when i went in its great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them
i am always so pleased with the customer service here for such a tiny starbucks  the do a really great job serving the masses that come in there and still manage to take the time to be friendly in the midst of the frenzy   outdoor seating in the summer is nice
its yet another michaels  and its a very good one recommended always for those who love crafting  michaels is a godsend
love this store  dont always have much luck with the sales  but i always find something i like here  this isnt your average marshalls or tj max  i think the green dress im wearing is from filenes
had a great time at sing sing a while ago with friends  friendly staff  will return
piano man to the tune of gangsters paradisewhat more do i have to say? get there early if you want a seat  $7 cover and really fun crowd we had sucha great time and i cant wait to go back
singsing what a blast one of my favorite places to jam on earth cool bar  cool town  cool people what else do you need the piano players are great  funny  semi good lookin i mean dude  you gotta go : love me some singsing
if you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night  go to sing sing : if you send a dollar up with a song request  they will play it if they dont know it  they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like  or they will look up the lyrics and sing it they aim to please : i have definitely been pleased :
sing sing is awesome give a buck or more and they will play anything  and if they dont know it  they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy : great humor too :
what a great time  this place was awesome  i wish i lived right down the road  because i could see myself being a regular here  honestly  these guys have got some talent  like real talent  they can play the piano  sing  play guitar  and the drums  did i mention that they are all pretty hilarious  too  id easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it    i am sure i will be back in no time at all  next time  i am bringing a big group of friends
went here for the first time this past weekend needless to say ill be returning it was a blast  it was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi good table though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up what is wrong with these people? everything if you ask me seriously though if youre going to reserve a table  you better freaking go   i had no complaints about the place itself the guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top anddd this has to be the only place ive ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk  because the comedians take no prisoners   i did enjoy when matt and joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better they are great at what they do cant wait to go back
went for my 25th birthday and had a blast servers are great  the show was hilarious and had the whole crowd involved only bad thing is it can get very expensive
what a great time the pianists are funny  talented  and just a tad crude but just enough to be funny
stopped in at sing sing to have a few drinks and hang out with some friends the entertainment was fun the guys do a great job singing  playing the instruments  and keeping the crowd pleased sing sing is attached to the rock bottom brewery so they have house beers i did have the sampler and i enjoyed all six beers i sampled what a great place to hang out i highly recommend
i brought my car here in 2006 for repair of a scratched bumper  the damage was minimal  but the work required removing my entire bumper for repainting  the staff were very helpful in explaining my options and presenting me with a few choices to get the most bang for my buck  they completed the work in the quoted amount of time and did a great job  a few weeks later  i noticed a spot that needed touched up and they handled it immediately and without question  i would definitely recommend these guys if you need bodywork or paint work done
i was so pleased with the quality of customer service at this body shop  from the very first time i took my car in for an estimate to a couple months down the line when i got my car repaired they still remembered me one thing i really like is that they always pick up the phone you wouldnt believe how annoying it is when businesses dont do this during normal business hours theyre so personable and gave me an honest quote that i couldnt turn down because it was the lowest in town i checked out 5 places they just really made this process painless and smooth i believe its a family run business  and boy does it show in their hospitality  fran and jason were the ones that i worked with   extremely knowledgeable and patient  especially with a customer like me who wants to make sure all the paperwork is thorough and calculations are accurate joe diiorios with an i not an l auto body also works closely with enterprise car rental down the street  so they came and picked me up those guys down there have a great relationship with this body shop as well and were really accommodating  overall  the quality of their work is amazing i had a large dent on the driver side front bumper and had to replace my light they ended up getting an oem light instead of the aftermarket one because it didnt match and get a brand new bumper they blended the paint for me  washed  waxed  and vacuumed my car  and their work has a lifetime guarantee what can i say other than give my highest recommendation and hope other yelpers can find this helpful  as this is how i found out about them
from my first phone call to joe diliorios  i was impressed every staff member i spoke too was kind and eager to help i was treated like an important client even though my car needed only moderate repairs from a low speed collision i was able to bring my car in right away for an assessment of the damage joe dilorios took care of everything from that point on they dealt directly with my insurance company  ordered the parts even getting new parts instead of the used ones my insurance company wrote the estimate for  at no cost to me  and gave me a call when all the parts came in i then brought my car back to them and they completed the repairs in a timely fashion when i arrived to pick up my vehicle  i was pleasantly surprised to see that they had vacuumed  washed  and waxed my car most importantly  the repair work was absolutely top notch they masterfully blended the paint to match older parts with newer repair parts my car looks even better than before the wreck  if you dont want any hassle  want to be treated with respect  and want your car looking fantastic  give these guys a call   adam
joe dilorios auto body shop was so helpful when i needed to get windows replaced the were able to give me a lower quote then competing auto body shops in the area they were also incredibly friendly and a pleasure to do business with im planning on taking my car here for all future auto needs
this place is amazing i needed my car repaired after an accident and the guys here were so helpful they set me up with a rental car as soon as i dropped my car off  repaired my car in a timely manner  detailed it for free  and their customer service was unbelievable i cant recommend this place more
im grateful to my insurance company for recommending di iorios auto body shop after an accident  i needed some body work done as soon as possible the other recommended shops wouldnt even make an appointment to see me for days these guys fit me in that afternoon  and coordinated the rental too everyone i worked with was courteous and pleasant  and the work was done more quickly than expected moreover  they found ways to help save on the expense the car came out looking better than before the accident   a few days later  i noticed they had buffed out some scratches that werent even part of the repair area i will definitely be back next time i need auto repairs
so lucky to be referred to joe diiorios after moving to pittsburgh its really invaluable to have car guys that you trust i could detail several experiences here in comparison to other chain shops  but suffice it to say that theyve always been honest  helpful  and fair
you can find pretty good body work without too much trouble  finding a place thats friendly  prompt  and organized that also does good body work is more difficult  joe dilorios delivers on all counts  highly recommended for the next time you   or somebody else   make a little mistake on the road
amazing repair service i hit a really fat raccoon in the appalachians it was dark and rainy and i didnt see the poor thing until it was too late while going fairly fast down a hill the raccoon destroyed my front bumper  the grill  and my right fog light thankfully i had duct tape in my trunk anyway  once i got back to pittsburgh  i called my insurance agent  my insurance referred me to diiorios and im really glad they did the staff was very friendly and helpful doing the estimate they even set up a rental for me when i was having the car repaired   they kept me updated on the status of the car and were just really pleasant to work with the whole time  hopefully i dont have to get any body work done on my car again anytime soon  but if i do  i know im going to take back to diiorios
lowes is my goto store for home improvement supplies its convenient and local to me  customer service is always great and prices are fair  my most recent experience with customer service was amazing so a hose burst on my hot tub call repair guy or try to fix it myself? i gave it a go took pictures of the hose and fitting and headed to the plumbing section i showed the gentleman the picture and asked for help he didnt have exactly the fitting for a hot tub  but gave me what he thought would work it did under $3 bucks later and all was a go winter came and it sprung a leak in same spot my fault and maybe lack of strength to tighten fitting and frigid temps back to plumbing section same gentleman gave me the advice again and bam  fixed  this is what i want in customer service sadly  i cannot remember his name bad customer on my part thank you
lowes is my first stop for all of my home projects   i am currently redoing door  lowes has knowledgeable employees that offer advice to the diys as well as a stable of contractors to hire out the big jobs   returns are handled seamlessly   who doesnt grab the wrong part?  their garden section is great for spring planting  they have competatively priced appliances  5% off with lowes credit card is also nice  having those large items delivered is a convenience their best asset is the expertise of the staff  i frequently change mind on an original concept based on their input   highly recommended
the food here can actually be a little hit and miss  but i love the grilled cheese club with fries i get it way too much people make fun of me  they have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards  fyi
awesome wings and pubgrub great beer selection and fun bartenders
dukethe owneris the man  hes a true pittsburgher and he loves everyone from pittsburgh  he looks like hell beat you up but hes a softy with a big heart  look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friendshell hook you up  hes also totally into the development of other pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups  ask him for a tour of the old eat n park next doori believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts  fortunately  the bar is close enough to the waterfront that its just far enough out of the ghettothe crowd is certainly decent  definitely have some beers on the porch in the summerespecially in the rain lower level is covered  very relaxing atmosphere  i wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent dukes more steadily were on the north side  still worth the drive to feel at home  have a good bite and some cold beers
if you want to know the people from homesteadmunhall then dukes is the place for you  a locals favorite theyve seen a lot of growth since i started going 10 years ago   they have a great selection of beer but i think where they really shine is in the food department    my favorite sandwich there is the pinkerton and its often hard to get anything else every time i go  pierogi pizza is pretty good as well as there gigantic sampler platter that a party of 4 could eat together  dukes is also an awesome place to watch sporting events with their see it from any angle tv selections all around the bar  soups of the days are awesome potato soup yes please and they have a excellent happy hour special that will save you a few dollars    ive always been treated with a welcoming vibe from the staff and i dont have any complaints
i find it frustrating to read bad reviews about great bars and restaurants that are based on almost nothing i eat and drink here about once a month and everything is great i have eaten here around 50 times and never had a bad meal great draft and great service this is the best bar in this area
love dukes and love the food i wish i could figure out the closing times or i wouldnt plan so many after work gatherings their food is amazing never had a bad meal and their prices are standard for crafts and actually pretty cheap for domestic
i really dont see how anyone could give this place a bad review  the food is fantastic and if its not my belly luring me in then its the awesome beer selection they have   my suggestion for those who are leery to try dukes after reading other ridiculous reviews is just order what they have on special that night everything is good so you cant go wrong and it will most likely come out faster and hotter being that its on special  if not i could suggest other delicious things to eat but i dont feel like typing out the entire menu they often switch the beers out so there is always a constant flow of different and unique craft beers on tap they can also print you out a list of beers and their percentage so you know what you are in for lol anyhow i love this place  the owners  and the staff i highly suggest it to everyone who likes good beer and good food
great place for a birthday party    a family gathering    a work retirement party    or even a double date  a combination watering hole  great place to eat and great entertainment for adults adult games  the homestead pittsburgh location of dave  busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country   from new york to florida to california     from canada to mexico    the dave  busters idea was conceived in little rock  arkansas back in the 1970s two different businesses one a popular watering hole  one a game  entertainment business were right next door to each other the two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense so they opened the first combined d  b in      no  not little rock  but dallas to this day there are no d  bs in little rock not sure what is up with that but lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses  the one in pittsburgh is the only one i have ever been to  when i lived there  a group of friends and co workers and me  of courseused to go there for happy hour  power hour     at least once a week we had a blast  a great place to kick back and let the worries of the work day melt away  wonder if theyll ever open one in marin county  ca? shucks  probably not not a marin county scene  for sure   what a blast it was though i miss going to d  b they have all the classics  like billiards  shuffleboard  plus over 200 interactive  video games a rechargable power card provides an easy way to access all the games    power hour is game happy hour     an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks    a great bar  wonderful food and service a relaxing and fun way to spend a friday or saturday evening youll never want to leave meet your friends here  grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games   time will just evaporate     while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl  your best friend or even your boss    dave  busters lots of parking lots of fun  fun fun fun fun fun fun     bring on the beer
dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games there is many fun games and prizes to win i highly suggest if you want to plays games  go wednesday when all the games are half off food is pretty good and a nice bar the downside is that the booze is pretty pricey
i love it  love it
dave  busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend  the main squeeze and i always 1 use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2 attend on a wednesday during the day flexible work schedules wed never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food and we only drink cheap drafts or drink cocktails during happy hour  your visit is largely determined by time of day  expectations and whether or not you eat their food if you come on a friday night  the lines will be long youll pay $150 for the two of you to eat  drink and play for 3 hours and youll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth  the staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee   note the drinks are weak reviews also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person thats typical white trash behavior bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests all of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because were courteous and tip well i have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed  loud guests and address me and take my order first this is rational  logical behavior   also note the prize center games suck comments youre supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize like life  delaying gratification nets you bigger returns every other visit ive seen someone walk out with a video game system wii  xbox360 and even a few xbox ones   the thing about dave  busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day sunday afternoon its all families and friday and saturday night its all drunk 20 somethings the atmosphere changes and thats why the reviews are all over the place  this review is based on 8ish months of 1 3monthly visits most visits are 5 stars  some are 4 stars  using survey receipts for buy ten get ten  avoiding wednesday  friday or saturday evenings and sunday afternoon  families and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply  youll have a great experience for $25 40person  i really enjoy the staff too  they split the difference between fun and professional special shout out to riley  gave us info on possibly hosting a party there
there is good food  but a great spot to enjoy a few drinks  watch sports on the big screens its great for adult fun after 10pm great for a first date if you like to have a good fun  feel relaxed
after having a few less than memorable trips to db in years past  my wife and i  decided to go back for a pittsburgh happy hour anniversary party this past thursday  pgh happy hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new watering holes every thursday and its run by a guy that seems to party 247 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job    anyway  pgh hh was celebrating an anniversary and chose db for the location  the db staff set up the back pool room with complimentary   enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low  our server  carla  was very attentive and friendly  making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point  the other server back there was working equally as hard but i never got the chance to get her name    i had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but i never got the chance to give them any credit  i think db is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event
first off  let me say that i find the people who usually work at dave and busters usually dont care or seem to be angry and hate their job a friend and i went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help the staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time the manager tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok every staff member we talked to was extremely nice this is by far the best dave and busters ive had been to
i always go there to either eat dinner or have drinks never had a problem with the food or drinksometimes i will play games there sometimesthe girls behind the counter are very nice even the one guy brett is also nicehe works very hard from what i can see as well as the girls that work there  even the one girl behind the counter was dressed very nicewhen i do go there they do know what i like to eat or drink although the restrooms should be cleaned a little more
great games and prizes amazing foodgreat way to enjoy your day with your family super busy place
we had our reunion banquet last weekend at this db it was the highlight of our gathering the room was spacious  well appointed with tables covered with black tablecloths and set up according to our specifications the buffet was delicious the manager  servers and bartender were enthusiastic and attentive what a wonderful facility  kids and adults loved the arcade games the pool tables were a hit too we appreciated the roomy dance floor for those who wanted to groove  in the months leading up to our event  special events representative laura checked in regularly she  sean and the managers made sure that our experience was memorable and even added extra touches that made us feel special thank you  db  for a great experience
this is a high quality clean and professional grooming shop i feel very comfortable leaving my golden retriever with this groomer  the focus is on clean and natural and not fancy perfumes and gimmicks
the woman working who cut my 9 month old schnauzer was wonderful he was very matted  not to mention nervous for his first grooming  and she still managed to do a wonderful job on him i could not be happier  especially because the people at petco claimed he needed to be completely shaven because they didnt have the time for it being it was a busy saturday paws in the family pet grooming actually cared and took the time with him and he because of that he got to keep his beard  his chest fur  and the fur on his legs he looks like a schnauzer i am so happy
great job always  i highly recommend ;  mandy  randy ; 
i am a big fan of rock bottom there are several dishes that are money appetizer:  seared ahi  spinach artichoke dip entree :      fire steak  pub tips or chicken fried chicken desert :      carrot cake to die for bar food:     pizza or ball park pretzels  both of which are sprayed with brown ale   half the menu is really good  the other half is great   the beer is good  ask for the sampler  they usually have a velvet and something on cask  ask for one of those if you are looking for something different  they will also have a scotch ale  an ipa  whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer which  if its still matt  the mood is grumpy   if andy is still working there  he is sure to please and molly is great in the cocktail area head over to sing sing after dinner and its a wrap i used to work there several years ago and i make it a point to hit every rb i possibly can dont go to the one in charlotte though  its not really a rock bottom
i love this place  great atmosphere and friendly service every time i go
i would have to say im pretty partial to rock bottom  i have been going almost every thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic team trivia my friends and i love the atmosphere  the dj todd  and the service that we get at rock bottom   every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it  except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new   as an avid rock bottomer  hands down i have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than i have had here at rock bottom whether i have eaten dinner or not before i come down to the restaurant  my favorite and my food of choice is the enormous ball park pretzels with the cheese dip it is a meal itself the mixture of onions  cheese  spinach and tomatoes is perfection   another favorite of mine is the barbecue chicken pizza  it has a great kick to it and its big enough for two people   the service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff   a truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people   come to team trivia every thursday at 8pm
fish tacos were excellent great brewed beers on tap as well
southwest egg rolls and fish tacos mmmmmmmmm ohh and the amazing brews
my husband and i got here a couple times a year    always except my veggies today get great food at a decent price   i love their side salad which has raisins and sunflower seeds    burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken mac and cheese   recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat
on a glorious day in the month of may   my love and i stumbled hungrily into rock bottom  ha just kidding i realized darren w hadnt reviewed here so i had to start it cheesy    the rock bottom line: monday for lunch we had awesome service by ashley  we werent rushed and it was quite  the burgers were great and half off  the beer was very good  we will be returning for sure
planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off service was extremely helpful  professional  and on point all night lauren one of the managers was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process if anyone is looking to plan an event i would highly recommend rock bottom couldnt be happier
i love this restaraunt rarely have i ever received service like i get here the food is good  definitely reasonable for the price the thing that blew me away was the fact that my steak was cooked to temperature this rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality but the servers are fantastic very attentive  polite and timely the beer selection is awesome  we always order the sampler i like having lots of options as far as beverages go the wait time isnt terrible if you go a little later on a friday or saturday night and they most often call you before the quotes time the desert menu is a little small  but i could probably skip it anyways ;  the ambiance is good  not to crammed or noisy they also have outside seating available when the weather is nice i highly recommend this establishment
i love this place great food and the best beer brewed on site the bourbonzola burger is the best thing you can order here
ball park pretzel would eat again   i came to rock bottom  looking for a great beer full of hops  that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction i then opened the menu  scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer i saw an extensive list of items  from chicken fingers to salads i noticed a ball park pretzel  with a jalapeno cheese dip i was blown away  the fact that i got 2 pretzels amazed me i ordered within 25 minutes of seating my pretzels hit the table within minutes the smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses but i knew we could step this shit up  i asked for mustard and what do you know grey poupon dijon mustard is in front of my eyes i combined that shit and life evolved i went to heaven  it took me 35 minutes to write this review because i took a solid bite with grey poupon after each sentence good look rock bottom  keep up the good work
i love rock bottom i dont frequent the restaurant side of rb as much as i do singsing  but the food comes from rb i order practically the same thing every time bacon mac n cheese  brewery nachos  and a beerusually an ipa or a manhattan and the last two times i was at rb  the food was disappointing: it was cold and unappetizing  my manhattan sucked  and the service was worse the food is always better over at singsing for some reasoneven if they do come from the same place   i was craving the mac n cheese  so i went down to pick some up i had a gift card  so i figured i wasnt out any money if the food sucked i saw that there was a new menu  so i sat down to order i got the street food quesadilla  bacon mac n cheese  and beer battered onion rings i also ordered a homemade root beer and a few samples of the house beer  everything was amazing it came out hot and tasted awesome they have a new head chef and it shows i was flooredthe new street food options are fun and tasty they are unique and differentnot something youd find at any restaurants in the area  the service was good my waitress was named liz and she certainly was on point she even helped me find a beer after i was sorely disappointed by the ipa offeringwhich was weird i always thought the house brews were tasty and fun  no matter their style or make im an ipa girl  but i would happily drink anything that came from their taps i was disappointed in the offerings  but i ended up settling on the pale ale that was quite tasty  in the end  if you were turned off by rock bottom before  id definitely recommend going back to check out the street food and new menu offerings service has dramatically improved  food quality has improved   and i was thrilled
the food is always plentiful  the atmosphere lively  the service friendly  and even though its always busy  i rarely have to wait for a table   if youre a nachos fan  this is the place often  i just make it my appetizer  salad  and meal yes  its that big   even though im not a big beer drinker  i enjoy their sampler  and i love their cider; it had just the right amount of kick
im visiting homestead this week for some work related training  rock bottom was recommended by the receptionist at my hotel  and im so glad it was  ive been there twice already and will go back before i leave in a few days  i sat at the bar during both of my visits  and the bartenders were both very nicebob during the day and paul at night  the pumpkin beer and milk stout are both awesome  like other reviewers stated  the nachos are great  i think the best part was that everyone was very friendly  other customers seated at the bar were eager to chat  which is so nice when you dont know anyone in the area  great place  thanks for the hospitality
we stopped in to grabs bite to eat before we went to improv my wife and i got the bacon chicken maccheese it was absolutely delicious right down to the last bite we raved about it all night long our friend got a burger and asked for it well done it came out medium so she sent it back the manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friends check pretty great service she loved the burger  and said it was one of the best she has had  i had the beer sampler and i liked all six beers they were good  i would recommend this place and if we are down that way i will definitely go back
great selection of beers especially the seasonal ones you wont be disappointed the jalapeno pretzels are dope
i have a little bit of mechanical knowledge  but not enough to land me a job as a mechanic i try to do a good bit of my own work to save on the repair bill and to avoid unscrupulous mechanics   i called a handful of shops to get a quote to replace an exhaust manifold gasket and bolts on my 05 grand cherokee alan owner quoted me $250 per side i have the 57 v8  so there are 2 sides to fix it sure enough  it was $250 out the door alan is a great guy that knows his stuff if it doesnt need to be fixed  hell tell you it doesnt need to be fixed but  if it does need to be fixed  it really does need fixing he even checked on a couple of other things and made some recommendations for other specialty shops for projects i plan on doing on this jeep  which he didnt have to do   i chose to give master a shot after my normal go to shop in monroeville didnt return my call seeking a quote for the exhaust manifold some of the reviews on google for master are unfair  with the chief complaint being a misunderstanding of personalities if you want to question what the mechanic tells you needs to be done  fine just make sure you know what youre talking about if you have zero mechanical knowledge  dont tell the mechanic how to do their job alan wont blow smoke up your dress and hold your hand if you want your car fixed  take it to master   thanks again  alan  for giving me the opportunity to boast on the jeep forums about only paying $250 for a repair that many have shelled out $1k  to fix youre my new go to shop for our vehicles   if youre curious as to their hours  i was there a little after 7am they are first come  first serve dont be an idiot and expect your car to be fixed 5 minutes after pulling into the lot oh  and dont park in front of the garage doors like a tool
great night out  i dont know if christopher titus set the ticket price or the club did  but at $25 a ticket  we will be going back often  great line up of top name acts coming to town  extremely nice staff highly recommend
this is the best giant eagle in the area and is the most like grocery stores in bay area heres why:  1 they sell beer 2 huuuuuge produce selection 3 naturalorganic foods section: cereal  pasta  soups  etc and fancy chocolate bars 4 long isle of ethnic foods includes mexican  indian  italian  asian and   of course  jewish 5 functioning bakery with fresh  appetizing breads and desserts i am still loyal to allegro hearth though  the store is huge and i havent been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flowers  balloons  homeseasonal section  dvd rentals and a photo center as well as a drive through pharmacy   it seems as this ge just might be the answer to my grocery stores woes
probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county  if not all of southwestern pa its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most giant eagles  and it has more upscale items i live an easy walk from the swissvale giant eagle  but i often drive to this location for the superior selection
this is easily one of the best giant eagles ive ever been to huge very nice selection easily comparable to whole foods went to their cheese market  and was pleasantly surprised with the selection i got beemster vlaskas  an amazing gouda very large parking lot
i have to thank the bakery  once again for getting me out of a jam twice  bekka  has made a great cake for my daughter when party planning was at its stress point her guest interaction is very professional and she always makes everything seem easy and manageable without a ripple thanks again bekka
this is a great supermarket  all of the staples  great deli  market square and bakery  fresh produce and extra convenient to have vegetables and fruits cut and packaged  love the fact that i can shop  drop dry cleaning  and pick up pharmacy items in one stop  close to other shopping and wonderful restaurants
such nice staff    i really lament the decline of the modern bookstore  i really enjoy browsing and picking up a new book    the store has a great selection and the staff are always helpful and kind    i really hope this store stays here for some  the prices are also fair and often have great discounts
i find this location  clean and well organized  but thats not the reason its getting 5 stars   i called today to look into whether or not their may issues of magazines were out i need them for my job and erin so kindly went checked on every single magazine i asked about   now that is customer service   well done  well done
there is nothing like a book and no better place to find one than a book store   this barnes and noble carries on a long history of excellence they always have an extensive selection and a friendly staff that is willing to find what ever book you are seeking
$1 burger night on tuesday add ons more
im surprised by the low reviews i am a regular here perhaps it is a little bit pricey  and that is the concern but  it seems like everything is pricey these days their pretzel appetizer is  fantastic  hot  fresh pretzels with sauces i also regularly get their grilled vegetable wrap  with broccoli instead of fries  or their salad wedge   theyve got nice outdoor seating with great fire ornaments  but  well  it is outdoors  in the past  service was really bad i quit going for a while  after having to do the wave for a check but  for the last 2 3 years  it has been really good ive found the staff to be professional  attentive  responsive  and friendly maybe these are old reviews?
one of my favorite places  and they have thee best lemon drop martinis plus the bar tender looks like clark kentsuperman very handsome guy
great atmosphere and rather humble  especially for a chain restaurant the service is always friendly  even if they are busy i enjoy taking clients out for drinks there because of the enjoyable bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu i highly recommend their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp   be sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too
best place for a late dinner they have a pretty diverse and interesting  menu kitchen is open til 2am the atmosphere is very relaxing and staff is always pleasant
the place where my fiance and i first met went back for anniversary  mentioned it to server  and were given a free dessert to help us celebrate very  very cool bar louie love ya even more now   jerk shrimp lettuce wraps are so spicy hot they blew us away   extremely spicy   very good but caused us to order plain old soft pretzel to balance out the heat  buffalo chicken flat bread   great but hot too
i love sandcastle  first  let me say that im reviewing the waterpark  not the people the park has little to no control over the people that visit the park and the way they or their children behave   if you are going to visit  i would highly suggest you try to go on a weekday ive attempted to visit on nice weekends before when the park has actually been at capacity and they are no longer allowing people in it gets crowded on the weekends  especially if the weather is nice there arent a ton of nice days in the summer in pittsburgh  so when there are nice days  people come out in droves   the slides are a blast  the lines are sometimes very long  but worth it the lazy river is great when its not wall to wall people i really enjoy the new dragons den but the line is crazy long for it they also have a fantastic bar area  we have gone a few times and enjoyed a festive beverage while we enjoy the sun  they have several areas for smaller children  which are all fantastic   if you are visiting  trying to take advantage of the giant eagle discount tickets  because these can get really pricey you can also do a sandcastlekennywood ticket  where you visit sandcastle during the day and kennywood at night its a fantastic deal  but boy could that be exhausting
we went to the sandcastle waterpark this past weekend before we went to heinz field  we are a family of four; dad  mom  17 year old girl  and 8 year old girl  we all enjoyed it  there was plenty to do for everyone; wave pool  kiddie pools  single tube slides  double tube slides  and body slides  it was a cloudy day in the upper 70s  so it wasnt crowded at all  check for coupons at giant  local flavor  and other places  some things dont open until 12 pm  even when the park opens at 11 am  parking is $600
for some reason  i had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress maybe i was just self conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place   abd mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears i may have had the store was empty when i arrived on a monday afternoon and i was attended to immediately and never felt pressured abd has a great selection of mattresses  and the prices cannot be beat i picked up a full plush pillow top mattress for a cool $375 without a box spring or a frame  since i already had one better yet? delivery is free and prompt you pick a three hour timeframe  and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one hour slot so youre not sitting around all afternoon
im a mattress buying novice i also hate buying things that require you to try before you buy i also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews anyway   i had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress if its terrible  youll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem who wants that? especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress?   these people were great they patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer   both times i called  the man on the phone remembered my name and number and took care of me when i failed to buy a box spring why oh why did i think i could go without a box spring?? they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the same day within hours  even they even helped me set up the mattress that i didnt purchase from them  which blew me away   their professionalism and friendliness are excellent i will recommend them to everyone whos in the market for a mattress  especially students  because their student deals are fantastic
the only place to buy a mattress  both my wife and i and our daughter desperately needed new mattresses so i decided to check this place out we went on a sunday afternoon and were the only ones in the store lee greeted us and showed us around the store they offer mattresses  recliners  dinettes  daybeds  bunk beds and bedroom furniture we found her a great mattress at a great price while waking around the store my wife found a serta icomfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on   lee had told us about their free 18 month no interest financing through wells fargo bank  free bed frame  free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer i went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but i bought us a new one as well no one can beat their prices i compared the price of our new mattress to levin  macys and mattress discounters no one came close to the price we got at american buyers everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free   take it from me  when it comes to your sleep  do not buy a cheap mattress we bought a cheap  supposed serta mattress in 2008 from mattress discounters the boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed i dont think i will have that problem again as our new serta has a full 25 year warranty   a couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered the delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame  box spring and mattress set up in less than 10 minutes  i highly recommend american buyers discount mattress for all of your bedding needs
this is the most reliable car service i have experienced in pittsburgh amazing service for the last four years  we have used them each week to pick up and drop off colleagues at the airport theyre always waiting by the hertz counter  ahead of time  without fail even when the flight is early or had a 3 hour delay they charge about $10 more than a yellow cab if you have client you need picked up or dropped off at the airport  i would highly recommend first class   my first time in pittsburgh  when the driver heard i was on an interview  he even gave me a free tour of a few neighborhoods in the city
i agree with the other reviewers i tried these guys based on the yelp reviews and was not disappointed   im a grumpy new englander  and have been frustrated by the small town  easygoingcareless customer service at many pgh businesses these guys are different: professional  punctual even in snow
great customer service  i was in pittsburgh for business and needed a car to get back to the airport  i found these guys on yelp  and the reviews were not wrong  it was easy to order the car and pick up was prompt
ditto everyone else i had out of towners needing to get to the airport but i had a last minute work conflict and couldnt drive them i was nervous about using one of the standard cab companies because their track record of actually showing up isnt great i called these guys the night before an 8am pick up and everything went smoothly dave even checked on their flight for us to make sure it was on time given bad weather if youre planning on getting a cab to the airport  definitely use first class
after reading glowing reviews on yelp  i decided to try this service to pick up my 83 year old mother and take her to the airport service was great driver was very courteous and on time we used them to pick her up at the airport and are equally happy the driver even carried her suitcases upstairs to her apartment
we always use first class limo for flights too early to take the 28x to the airport  they even have a multi pickup service for early flights if you are not in time for a regular reservation
fabulous service all around my husband was coming in on a redeye flight from san diego around 9am on saturday morning  and just before midnight on friday  i realized i wasnt going to be able to pick him up i called first class limousine service around 12:30am and was pleasantly surprised that someone picked up i ended up speaking to dave  the owner  and he was able to accommodate my last minute request   my husband initially went to the wrong meeting place on account of his sleep deprivation : so the company called me asap when he didnt show up right away i reminded hubby about the correct meeting spot and all went well after that he was very happy with the service and the price id definitely use this company again for rides to and from the airport thanks everyone
excellent service the driver was first class truly was the best car service i have ever experienced driver was classy  professional and kind great reservation service and very fair price do yourself a favor skip the cab and call this car service reliable  professional and great value thank you
im not sure what it is about this place that i love so much i have been eating here for probably 10 years now  and it never disappoints its not fancy  its not unique  its not some fantastic restaurant  its a chinese takeout place but it is delicious everything i have ever ordered is good the general tsos  the chicken with broccoli  the beef with broccoli  the sweet n sour  the teriyaki  etc etc but the real treats are the egg rolls and the wonton soup their lunch specials are all six or seven bucks and are more than enough food for a big guy like myself it is also always ready in 10 15 minutes  affordable  fast  and delicious
everyones been to fridays i am sure  but i enjoy the yucatan salad its delicious my children love fridays its usually there 1st choice i also love the cajun chicken  shrimp pasta very very good
while visiting relatives in somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of homestead  my aunt insisted that we have lunch at unos pizzeria  grill as the food was delicious  when we arrived i had to admit that i was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place  it was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes  the waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease  i settled on a turkey  bacon and avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times  they have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages  the food arrived in no time and was delicious  the portions were just right for lunch  i was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping  the four of us had items off the two for u lunch menu  our bill was less than $30 which meant that i might could afford the shoes i wanted to buy  my aunt was right  you cannot visit homestead without stopping to eat at uno pizzeria  grill  it is fantastic
it gets 5 stars cause it jogs up a memory back before pizza hut turned into a fast food restaurant  the pizza hut my grandfather used to take me to was a really nice restaurant and this location has the same look and feel as the old pizza hut before it went take out   so this is the old style pizza hut   very family orientated dining style you can sit here for hours and so we did we had a heap of use in a long table  i ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy 1 get one free disappointed in the selection of that seeing other choices i regretted going on the cheap   prices are moderate 12 for a little pizza but with all the dough  you get full cant say i walked away hungary nor did i finish my second mini pizza   i want to come back and get that spanich fetta looking pizza
i would write anthems  poems  novels about their pizza   ive dreamed of their pizza since i was a child my only encounter with my beloved uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day  i would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose toppings from the box the cold 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind  i desperately tried to find an uno but found that the nearest one had closed down closed down my dreams were crushed  my psyche disturbed i had become a changed person i wanted more i needed more my mother stopped coming home with uno take out boxes i stopped eating pizza i hated the flimsy crusts that were just cheap variants from my beloved uno  i despised the new york style that you could so easily fold feh  i would resign from eating pizza till i had my precious my precious  my uno deep dish   it wasnt until that fated day when i drove past an uno the neon lights called out to me  it was like seeing heaven for the first time i stumbled into the uno dazed  the smell was like nothing i had ever experienced on this green earth  there was nothing i could compare it too i sat down and ordered the numero uno with a side of fries  no not personalregular i wanted the entire thing  not just a wedge of a dream i wanted the whole thing   it came out  steaming bubbling oozing fresh so fresh i took a bite   the cheese was perfectly melted and then another   the dough was so thick and tasteful and then another   ooh that sausage until there was nothing left   i had achieved my dream but i will be back for more i will be backfor my precious   but the fries were mediocre
i love this particular loft store everything is nicely set and the atmosphere is relaxing the quality of clothes is really good and i do believe its good value for money they usually have more chic and classic clothes which i love the staff is exceptional here i love that they are really trying to help finding the right clothes for you instead of telling you how beautiful everything looks on you i always feel welcomed and i really do appreciate the fact that i am not being approached by a staff member every two minutes this unfortunately happens in a lot of other stores in this area this store feels more personal combine that with quality and affordable clothes and happy staff members and you definitely have a new regular customer
any place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me  pf changs has a dedicated gluten free menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease  they also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross contamination  i dont know many other restaurants that go this far  aside from the menu preference  i enjoy my overall experience every time  their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a chinese take out or buffet joints  dont expect this to be at all like that  its not a buffet  they dont sell general tsos though changs spicy chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar  its my personal favorite or other signature foods that you may expect  they do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments  just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure  they also sell sake  i believe they have a few different types    the prices can get a bit more expensive than your average chinese restaurant depending on what you get but its well worth it  portions are excellent and the taste is great  ive yet to have one complaint and i have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years  the only downside  it can be a little crowded and a bit loud  its also very dark because of their lighting  however  i think it sets the atmosphere  it can be a romantic place or a casual place  ive been there for both
we recently went here for a group dinner with friends  i am unable to eat gluten and my server denice was knowledgable and brought me special sauces as not to irritate my allergies  she was amazingly accommodating and when my meal was too spicy which was totally my fault she got me something else  i had the gf beef with broccoli and it was amazing  she was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves  we were there for a while and were all on separate checks  ive been to eateries before where that was treated with great disdain  never once did i feel unwelcome  i will go out of my way to eat here again
great food  great atmosphere  little on the loud side but they have turned down the music since the last time we were here so its much better  good service
i will say make a reservation since its pretty busy on a weekend  we got seated quickly with a reservation  our server was excellent despite how busy it was  he was also helpful with recommendations and let me sample a couple wines before picking a bottle  the manager was also great  we werent in love with one of the dishes and the manager came out and talked to us about what we were looking for and gave us a complimentary order of what he recommended  i will say this   they know how to treat their customers well definitely be back :
our family loves this restaurant  my children and i suffer from food allergies   i have celiacs disease and their gluten free selection for a chinese restaurant is great  my children are a completely different ball game  they have a rare disease called eosinophilic esophagitus where food attacks their body  they are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten  soy  eggs  dairy  nuts  tree nuts  fish  shellfish  amd corn  this restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash  the servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful  our favorite manager is joe and favorite server is kevin  call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions
this place hit the spot   stopped here before a movie and ate at the bar we got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats   i recommend the fried green beans with aioli    soooo good who knew i liked green beans? and this trip i tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef  it was extremely fresh and delish so who cares if its not beautiful?
good food  good service  and always an enjoyable visit they forgot to put in our appetizer order but threw it in for free to make it up to us a good place to catch a meal if youre down around the waterfront
i used to work here  haha  many moons ago tho  usually you leave a restaurant job sick of the food and the people but even after i left i still love going in and talking to the staff and getting something to eat and drink and just hanging out    im a changs chicken junkie and i cant stay away from it for too long  the bartenders have always been some of the best ive ever seen no matter how many changes theyve gone through and this is one of the few places where even years and years later the same people work and still love it  says a lot about the people    changs chicken  chicken lettuce wraps and pork won tons though are the standard fare are always amazing  some other excellent dishes are kung pao chicken  shrimp dumplings  mongolian beef and the ahi tuna  it might be a chain restaurant but this one is one of the strongest links in the chain
thank you so very very very much to the management hallie  she literally helped me with immediately with an error that was on my gift card    also hallie visited our table during our meal to see if everything and everybody was okay   also our server  aaron  was really helpful and sweet  i am a very very picky eater  i dont like onions  garlic  peppers  mushrooms  broccoli  rice  etc  aaron was awesome in his help as i selected my food     very rarely do  i eat dessert  i love their  pineapple coconut ice cream  there banana sprung rolls are good  but the ice cream is to die for  the two come together
this is largely a review for sean  a managing partner at this location i had gone to this location while in town with my family for the holidays  looking for a non cooking escape before getting inundated with guests a few of us ordered the lunch special with soups  my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli  and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls everything was great the street noodles in particular are fantastic  but the service was a bit of a disaster  dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other  a huge mood killer with a big family meal; a few dishes came out dirty; soups didnt come out at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didnt apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders we were feeling really ignored and discouraged  until we let sean know he took great care of us and went way  way out of his way to make up the experience i really cant thank sean enough for making sure we left in a good mood after what could have been a very negative experience heaven knows that a positive tone is essential going into the holidays with family
gordons in the waterfront is exactly what i needed for new shoes after i was allowed to walk again after a fracture in my foot  the man who waited on me was kind  patient  and even let me know about a sale going on  the selection and quality of shoes is wonderful  you wont get cheap shoes here but you will get the best worth every cent
extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish the shoes i bought were high quality and durable i was extremely impressed by the staff
this is by far my favorite panera location in the pittsburgh area friendly  plenty of room to sit  and good quality food  coffee panera is a great place to hang out and read the news   they even have free wifi try their toasted sandwiches  especially the chicken bacon dijon
amazing amazing place and i really enjoy to eat there and drink the prices they not high  very good service and fast 
panera is one of our familys favorite restaurants everything is great kids love bagels and chicken noodle soup adults usually order you pick two sandwiches  salad are all very good
i only allow my dogs to go to dr bezak ive had a couple chow chows who a lot of vets are afraid of doc had a chow himself so knew what to look out for in the breed he has taken good care of them over the years
