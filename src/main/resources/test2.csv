After waiting for almost 30 minutes to trade in an old phone part of the buy back program  our customer service rep incorrectly processed the transaction This led to us waiting another 30 minutes for him to correct it Dont visit this store if you want pleasant or good service
Very disappointed in the customer service We ordered Reubens  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut They charged us $300 for the coleslaw We will not be back  The iced tea is also terrible tasting
I will start by saying we have a nice new deck That is where the good part ends  Why two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well  it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process He was a true salesman  Ill tell you that Not a straight shooter  but an excited salesman that wanted to sell And we bought into it  He told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs  but they could probably start by June 24th Mind you  this was the end of May we met with him He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started We felt confident in going with them  and booked it  Heres where things fell apart Weeks went by with no word from them on the process Finally I called and left messages Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles So I hung up not knowing what was going on Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back I wish Al would have told us that  So our June 24th date came and went We finally got our survey And they were quick to bill us for it  but no word on where we were in the process I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont  A month later  I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit  but we were now going on a month He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it   I completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault  but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me theyre waiting for the permit  but theyll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is Seems simple  Finally we get the permit and work is supposed to start Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes theyre digging So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days Where did everyone go? Who knows  because I wasnt informed   I was upset and contacted the company owner  Dave  by email I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication He wrote me two sentences that  said there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow Well  that didnt happen  Then two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong So apparently the part about how they wouldnt need access to my house changes to theyre drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck   Finally  the second week into construction  my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty  and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasnt cleaned up I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didnt use  and they only filled up one When you create a construction project  isnt it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didnt happen here  My main point is  contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front  nor was the ongoing process communicated to me Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes  leaving the site dirty I understand things happen and things get delayed  but just email or call me Its not that hard to keep me updated  it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted  Even though I have a nice deck after I clean things up myself  I would not recommend them to anyone
Hoofah
Average run of the mill store  Associates are young teens and they really dont know where anything is  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything  Found my puppy treats and moved on
Real talk:   I took my car through the carwash here once  got a nasty gouge down the side  and the guy at the counter didnt seem to care   The car wash has since been decommissioned  which is totally OK because the getgo carwash across the street is excellent and better in every way
Two meals  on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place  and after the second trip  I was compelled to write Rocky would definitely describe the experiences  On the first trip  I went to try their at that timeraved about Reuben And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh  I tried it  Well  they were out of the proper bread  and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find  which was not the proper bread  and instead of one of their raved about Reubens  I received two mini Reubens  which basically took the guts from one Reuben  and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread I ate it It wasnt great  but they swore it was because theyd run out of the bread Bread or not  it still wasnt great The atmosphere was pleasant in that blue collar bar kind of way  and the staff was very nice  but not a winning pitch on the Reuben  The second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend Sat in the back room  instead of the bar  which felt more like a restaurant  of course  with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment  I was in the mood for dinner this time  and after a scan  decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar My friend ordered one of her faves  the breaded pork chops  We hit the salad bar  which was uber basic Three soups mostly vegetable loaded  which left me out  basic iceberg lettuce mix very probably out of a bag  a few veggie toppings  and three or four dressings It was a basic salad  no big deal More or less an appetizer filler before the meal  The mind blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant  skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face  and an air of vapidity  which was confirmed when I placed my order I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner  and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to ask  and the child honestly had no clue what white meat and dark meat meant The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre portioned prepared bag  kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken stylewhich didnt answer my question  thus prompting the second trip   After the second trip back I heard the cook holler Tell him Ill fix him up   Well  the chicken was prepackaged dreck like youd find in the freezer case of Walmart  tiny and not good  and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem spuds flavor  laden with some kind of chopped up green parsley?  and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets  Thank goodness for the basic salad bar  Even my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what shed expected They also appeared to be from a freezer bag  The irony was that the boy who didnt know white meat from dark meat  was chatting with some other customersabout baseballand he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball Ahhhh da burgh  Third base? Nahwhy bother when there are so many other options around Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegiethey can help you out all types of ways in that area Just dont go hungry if you actually have tastebuds  From what I understand it used to be really good homecooked food But apparently  mama has left the kitchen
We came here once before and remember it not being very good  but figured wed give it another shot since its pretty close to our home Its still just OK We didnt have to wait this time Saturday morning at 10:30  but there was a wait throughout the time we were there The menu is very basic  no specialty pancakes  waffles  or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette There were no meal options  so if you want home fries or something  its extra The omelettes do include toast Great bread  btw We had to wait a while for our food  which was surprising because weve been to a lot of diners My husband and I both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg Its almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over As for my mushroom and cheese omelette  the cheese was lacking My biggest peev about this place is that its CASH ONLY Perhaps I missed it  but Im pretty sure this wasnt noted anywhere on the menu or the front door Thankfully  we had enough to cover our bill  buts not a good way to end the meal when youre scrambling and digging for change There are a lot of good diners in the area  so I doubt well be going back
My first time going to Barbs Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place  I really didhowever  I didnt  The food was decent  some was above average and some below but it was overall decent I got pancakes  bacon and eggs The pancakes were really good and fluffy  the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well My son had a burger and it was good The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate I would give the food 35  The service was subpar for sure While our waitress was a really nice girl  she wasnt on top of anything at all Had to ask for coffee refills  had to ask for silverware  for napkinsetc She got the order messed up and so on I give the service 25  The inside of the place had some country charm as youd expect but want particularly cleanly It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell I give the interior 25  The prices were decent I fed my whole family breakfast 3 of us for $23 I give the prices 35  So in summary  you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barbs
It looks so much better in here since they changed from Paddys to Rileys Its a shame  however  that they had to keep that same curmudgeon of a bartender that ruins the experience Can somebody notify me once they get rid of him?
Okay  so hopefully you havent been enjoying happy hour  Rileys Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners   To recap: Murphys Pour House from 1979 1985 Sullivans Pour House from 1995 2002 Paddys Pour House from 2002 2012 And  bagpipe please  Rileys Pour House opens March 1 of 2012 Still with me?  Its a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs No more smoking allowed Hurrah  Same lousy service   My guess is that the entire place needs no  strike that  demands an automated foodbeverage ticketing system None of the cooks  bartenders  or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table Its actually pretty funny if youre not a hungry or b thirsty   I really really want this place to do better We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes   Get it together  Murphys  er  I mean Sullivanser  I mean Paddys or is it Rileys? ;    Whatever the case  they have cold Guinness And Irish music  And fun patrons
I love LJS  but I  had to write a review regarding this particular location  The inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for  It smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door  It took about 15 mins for the food  so I figured it was gonna be all freshnegative  The fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft  The corn lacked butter  I didnt care for the onion rings and my boyfriend said the Coleslaw tasted spoiled  The chicken planks and hushpuppies were the only things edible    Service wasnt too bad   nice people  Too bad a whole bunch of flies started flying around the dining area and prep area  which ruined my appetite
Far away from real Chinese food Doesnt even taste good as American style Chinese food
I used to order takeout here once every month or so The food tastes average and the price is good Its your typical low end Chinese place   The last and final time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds While I was waiting on my food which took much longer than usual the inspector was pointing out violations He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions    As for the rest of the place   its always been kind of dirty inside The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match There are always childrens toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there  so be careful not to trip   The workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking
I bought a three month membership last year  mainly to attend the Silver Sneakers classes I was in my early sixties and hadnt exercised in a while I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult  so I tried a morning class for seniors I like to stretch out before my class actually starts  so I went to the tail end of a yoga class The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasnt welcome to stretch out in their class I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members I didnt feel welcome here I complained to the manager  who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to  but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident Do they think that this is their private gym?
I have to say that I write this review with much regret  because I have always loved PaPa Js But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit   From the minute we were seated  we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didnt know the menu As I said before  Ive been to PaPa Js a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well  but the server couldnt explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago  But it wasnt just the knowledge of the menu It was one thing after another with our server My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it at which point the meal was over  so we didnt care at that point  I mean come on  for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water  My biggest complaint  however  is what happened with our meals My dad and I both ordered the trout special trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat Instead  the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms Not what the special was at all  And by the way  that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server which  we are sure it was or the chef  who knows for certain Not to mention  though  that a good server wouldnt have served us that regardless   But before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server  let me continue When we informed our server of the mistake  he didnt really believe us until he checked his order sheet  and then he blamed the error on the chef At this point  the meal had been sitting because it took us forever to flag this guy down again so the trout was basically cold The server then said he would have the meals re made So  he took the meals back to the kitchen Meanwhile  of course  my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for  and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda yes  believe that or not All the kitchen did was scrape their mistake off of our fish They didnt remake anything Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it Quite frankly  the fish wasnt good at all I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonalds that night The server never did anything to try to make our experience better   he knew we werent happy  but never offered anything such as dessert on the house Im not looking for a handout  but our experience was just plain awful that night The guy never really even apologized for the mistake Normally  I may have asked for a manager  but at this point I was ready to just get out of there plus  we had to be somewhere else that night  My opinion for the money  there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at
Coming here you get the feeling they havent changed much  The tables  the decorations  the menu  All the same  Does that make you a little worried?  Yes  I ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was oily  Very very oily  The actual ravioli was okay  enough mushrooms  but it was oily  Did I mention that?    Ambiance  like I said  left much to be desired  I dont think Id have this place on my list of musts for downtown  Much better restaurants to visit
Service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are just working  They have nice decor nice bar and good bread Consider where this place is  the prices are really really high  Nothing is served on the side with main dishes 
Although the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant  much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience Our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room  right by a door where clinking pots pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal  as well as a Darth Vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent Our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items  and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered  dressing on the side of a salad   less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree The waitress blamed it on the cook  but did offer to get one entree changed Also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts  feta or Gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 200 extra per item in addition to the salad price 699 which brought the salad up to 1099  Outrageous  There is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant   but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere I will most likely not return Very overpriced for the quality and service
Papa Js is expensive and inconsistent  The ambiance is nice but it doesnt justify the prices  There are better restaurants in Carnegie
Man has this place gone down hill  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago  We had salads and pasta  Both were on the verge of inedible  With a single glass of wine  I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag  Seriously  I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home Classico is better  And the service was pretty absent to make it even worse seemed she knew it was terrible and didnt want to deal with it  Seriously  Id rather eat at the OG
Once upon a time  Papa Js was a great place to eat Great food and knowledgeable wait staff Unfortunately  after a couple of very unsatisfactory meals we will not be going back  Looking for a great Italian meal? Look elsewhere
Our pizza was cold and our drinks where empty  We are not going back  The waitress started as attentive  but slowly slipped away to the point where things became frustrating
I struggle to write this review simply because this dining experience confused me First  the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown Carnegies main street When you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with desserts and amazing looking house made breads It rather looks like a deli counter You have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area A bit confusing layout  but tastefully done The dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant It felt much more upscale once in the dining area  but I did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique   The food   A wide range of Italian dishes and seafood We ordered the crab hozel as an appetizer It was an average serving of lump crab meat  I had to ask for cocktail sauce It was tasty  but cost us $18 We then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggies like artichokes  eggplant  peppers  etc There were 4 smaller sized cutlets of veal and 3 shrimp $28 There was no salad or pasta side offered The dish was prepared properly and was OK We just felt it needed something else   Now the bread that was offered to our table came in a small basket and was filled with a variety of their house made breads The pepperoni bread was AMAZING I mean really delish This alone I would have given 5 stars   The service   Our server waswellIm not sure what he was quite frankly Annoying?Confused? Hyper?  He appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time Bouncing around the table  asking the same questions over and over  forgetful  spastic  etc At one point one of my colleagues said  Is he on crack? We chuckled  but seriously He forgot to even ask us if we wanted dessert  which was too bad because we saw some amazing looking offerings in the cases as we were leaving  Overall   If I were in the area again I would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go  as they do sell it by the loaves However  I think I would try somewhere else to dine
Ok a few things First we walked in and asked for a table and was told it would be 5 mins So after 10 mins  we were seated and there was 10 tables that were open Why the hell was there a wait??? The older man that took us to the table could have done nicer The bread was great and that was about it The food was not bad but it was not good
I wrote a letter to the Papa Js  but did not receive a reply therefore I will share my experience online  Tonight a friend and I dined at your location We were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk  which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials Our server took our order of a gingerale  fried zucchini appetizer  side salad  wedding soup   eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata  correct spelling  We thoroughly enjoyed the bread & wedding soup The side salad was rather bland and unexciting  lacking flavor & texture The Spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce  a single slice of tomato and one black olive I would have expected some additions such as onions  peppers  cheese  cucumbers  croutons  carrots and the like     We enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer  but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal  so we asked the server  bartender  about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to put it in He offered to put it in at this point  but advised us that our meals would be out soon We decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to      The main dishes were acceptable  not outstanding The eggplant was very tasty and well prepared  The Chicken Piccata was flavorful  but not as expected The chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked It had no signs of being coated and sautéed  to a rich golden brown The chicken was just pale white The sauce was a simple lemon flavor  it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken I tasted no garlic or shallots The sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers  which were absent  No pasta was served with the chicken The side of vegetables were well cooked  buy again lacked any real flavor The would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars    Once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another 20 minutes for the check The server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers The total was $43 and change I would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order  but no such offer was made and  I saw no manager come around and check on the customers  as is customary I am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience  I hope this feedback will be beneficial to your business
Typical Starbucks coffee chain 2 things I dont like about this Starbucks:   1 Ive been there twice and both times the place has been dirty  compared to the other Starbucks I have been in  2 If you have to use the bathroom  they give you a key thats attached to this nasty bottle Im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly  Aside from that  good coffee and fastfriendly service
If there was ever a get your coffee and go Starbucks  this is it Right in the center of the Waterfront  this Starbucks has no sofa  comfy chairs  only table seating I love the baristas here  But I dont like the location of the building
This Starbucks is teeny tiny  Seating inside is VERY limited  This is a Starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the Waterfront  Baristas are friendly and fast
Im not a huge fan of this location I think that it was oddly built  the small  alley like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way tofrom the bathroom or tables when its busy And theres hardly any tables to sit at Furthermore  people tend to clog the front on their way in  which makes things particularly difficult especially in the winter weather The staff were pretty impersonal to be  but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there And the coffee that I had was cold  Im sure it was probably the bottom of the batch Id probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area
This particular Starbucks was especially pushy with offering extra espresso shots when placing my order This has never happened before and it took me off guard  The barista came off dishonest and unfriendly with the up sell push  I will avoid this one at the Waterfront for awhile
For someone who straddles the line between sometimes craft er  this store can seem vast and confusing  Theres rows and rows of baskets and bedazzling jewels and paper andoh myscrap booking  When I want to find boring old feltits likewhere do I start?    Im in a hurry  as always  and I rush in and the first thing I look for is an employee  No one to be found  I could call out and my voice would come echoing back  I run between rows of paper  wood and gosh darn scrap bookingno felt  Where do I find felt  Where do I find an employee?  FINALLY  I find one after 15 minutes of wondering around  Shes incredibly nice and leads me to the felt  This is not the first time Ive been hard up to find help  I tell her she was hard to find  and she tells me that theyre low on payroll and cant have any one the floor BUT HER  In that WHOLE store  JUST HER  Thats ridic  Not a month ago I was  again  in a slight hurry and stood in line for about 15 minutes to check out  with 2 employees at the register and 6 people per line  I gave up and walked out    Hey Michael  do you pick up what Im putting down?  Youre not making any money because your costumer service SUCKSin fact  theres no service to be found
The one good thing I can say about Michaels is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection Theyve got items for woodwork  painting  knitting  kids crafts  scrapbooks  you name it The problem is  the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal Theyve got lots of cool items all over the store that youre convinced that somehow you need Because it is soooo cute  and you could TOTALLY do something with it Right? The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere However  if youre looking for something specific  good luck Its not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store Its that when you find the right section  theres either nothing in stock  or they simply dont even carry what you need   I stopped in for crochet supplies  and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway   Plus the prices at Michaels are significantly more than other area craft stores I usually only stop there if Im already at tend Waterfront Id recommend checking other craft stores first Unless you need glitter Especially fine glitter Michaels has the best glitter selectionquality of any store Ive ever been to
Well as Steak n Shake locations go  this isnt the best one around but it is burgers and fries that are open 24 7  The milkshakes are good  PROS:  Always made fresh  when you order;  CONS: Greasy but its burgers; Takes longer than typical in drive thru but thats bc theyre made fresh; Service on a scale of 1 10  10 being awesome is a 4
In general I do like Shake N Steak  but this location is a hit or miss location  You never know what kind of quality or service youre going to find here  A friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there EVER  You cant entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire placepoor scheduling on the managers part However  while she cant be accountable for the slooooow service  she was accountable for both orders being incorrect  The burgers were over cooked and the fries were soggie and the milkshake was runny at best  By far my worst visit to Steak n Shake
Rather typical SnS  Had a good lunch crowd  Milkshake was good but not as good as EnP down the street  It took to long to get the burger for some reason  25 minutes  I realized cooked to order but this is a little long for SnS  Ordered the Guacamole Steakburger and it only had a small portion of Gaucnot your usual amountkitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason  Definitely did not look like the picture on the website  Oh well
This place is s l o wlike so slow I have got up and left after waiting 30 minutes and not even being acknowledged by a server The food is okay Def not worth the wait Milkshakes are just okay as well Booooooo
I really like the chili Burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad Pretty hard to mess up a side salad As others have said you never know what kind of service you will get Store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair The staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude All in all what you pay is what you get Cheap and crap service
The food is good Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss The main issue seems to be with the kitchen  the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and its pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints
This place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star review  Ive had pretty good experiences inside  its usually the drive thru where things fall a part    Its the rare place I can get a Frisco Melt well  the ONLY place I can get a Frisco Melt  and that steak burger alone is worth the risk  Walk In OR Drive Thru  Just take a gun on Weekends  youll be fine
Its okay Food is cheap but portions are small For example I order the chicken tenders  and I got 3 little tiny tenders  and a decent amount of fries Also the restaurant is not really clean either  This restaurant is not my number 1 choice
I like to eat here because the food has always been good and kids eat free on the weekends which is great But this location is always woefully understaffed  with five or six tables sitting unbussed while people wait to be seated Whether youre inside or at the drive through the wait is incredibly long Fortunately the staff are always friendly despite the ridiculous staffing levels the management maintains here
Slow service Food is VERY cheap though The milkshakes are huge thick and yummy Sometimes when I go here  they completely ignore you when your the only person in line The burgers were good and the menu is pretty small Food takes about an hour to come when no ones even there I would go here if the service was faster and better
Another store which has gone the way of the Dodo bird Actually there was nothing basement like about it What will be done with the empty space that is the question?
$975 for a red bull and vodka? Im sorry  I thought I was in Pittsburgh  not New York City Sing Sing  a dueling piano bar  is fun  but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if I could have more than one watered down drink before I warbled my way through Paradise City with the rest of the crowd
In my opinion  Sing Sing is really not worth it It gets expensive because you drink  maybe start to sing a few lyrics  drink some more  think of a song you wanna hear  put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper  you drink  they play it  everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky noteand so on and so forth I wasnt really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time  its not worth it But again  thats just me  The 2 stars are for the piano players  who are entertaining and very talented  and the Rock Bottom brews they serve
This place has gone significantly down hill  Ive gone to Sing Sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years  When we started going there you couldnt get a seat unless you got there early  It was always packed  However  each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller  Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all  I was there last Saturday night 8412 and there was about 20 30 people there  Very slow and boring  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage  taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing  Save your $7 and skip this place  A real shame because this place was once a lot of fun
I went here with a bachelorette party We had reservations  which was good because it was packed that Saturday night The performers were very talented  but the acoustics were strangely off   The theme that ran through the whole show was  to quote some phrases they kept repeating  you bitch  you slut  you whore and  twinkle twinkle little slut  why dont you take it up the butt which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage You get the idea?  Perhaps if I had not been the designated driver  alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth  sixth  seventh time Or maybe not
This place is overrated A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food  instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced Theres nothing wrong with this place I just dont understand the clout around it There should be no clout
Theres lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place  but the food was average at best  We were there on a Pens Playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms  Our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that  Our orders were somewhat mixed up  The potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing  I tasted a slice of pizza  which is definitely the best thing they offer  The crust was delicious and homemade  If you are going to order something  I would go with the pizza  We also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good  also  If you are looking for good food  Homestead better choices at Blue Dust or Tin Front
Ive been to Dukes three times now When I first came to PGH  a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game  drink some brews and get great food Most of that is true  but the bad has mostly outweighed the good  They have an excellent new tap system Last time I went  they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft  and it was perfect The system really elevates already awesome beer Plus  the selection is awesome   It is a sports themed bar  so you can expect drunk locals  loud TVs and plenty of yelling Im sort of into that  so it doesnt bother me  although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos Service is often slow  and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer This is not a good place for trying something new  as they cant tell you a thing about it   The biggest downfall of Dukes  though  is the food Ive had three different  but equally simple  dishes there; A Burger  a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders The first was flavorless and cold The second was passable  but nothing special And the last were absolutely awful Honestly  the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill  I had to call it an early night I ate two of the 7 tenders SEVEN and had to quit  Their fries are very good And so are the wings  Id say Dukes is a good place to drink  but thats about it
D&B is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers You feel a bit milked afterwards Also much fatter  You pay for games using credits from mag stripe cards This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending Menus for drinks and food have no prices $605 for a Banana Split cocktail? $340 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology like anchors and so forth  Waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts Oh  and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table  The games are all violent shooters or racing games dont appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future  Not a pleasant experience  but at least its different from going to an ordinary restaurant
Think Chuck E Cheese for adults  Skee Ball  video games pool tables  Clean environment  Good fun  Unfortunately  I went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu  I ended up settling for spinach dip  Sadly  they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds  Blahhhh  Trying to get something healthy  I ordered the apple pecan salad  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle  I could barely eat the salad  Too sweet  My mom ordered a steak rollholy friedness  The steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried AGAIN  Yowzer  Artery clogger for sure    I like the atmosphere  I like the bar area  Perhaps next time well just stop by for drinks instead
Dave and Busters is an enigma  is it dining  a bar  or  playground for video game lovers? Let me get the bar part out of the way first  its overpriced  and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill   Next  the food Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront  there are sandwiches  burgers yes they have a blue cheese burger  who doesnt? pasta  salads  chicken fingers  yadda yadda   The games  I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene  Overall Dave and busters is unique to the Waterfront  but its time to update the menu  update the games  and get into the second decade of the 21st century
Not much of a review for this one  but just a few tidbits of info  Pool on FridaySaturday is $14 per hour Im pretty sure its $10 through the week  Mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location The food is crap  The games are fun and the pool tables are nice theyre the big tournament stylesize  not the shitty bar room  tiny pool tables  That is all  :  the pricing is based on my recent trip We shot pool for a few hours  I had a bar tab that wasnt out of control and my night ended up costing me $60
When did Dave and Busters become a daycare?? Everywhere you look  there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult  but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday I couldnt even walk through the place without someone shoving me AHHH I get that Dave and Busters is an arcade and that youre going there to play some games  maybe eat  and kill some time When I last went there a few years ago  we there for my bachelor party  and while Im sure we got into some shenanigans  I dont remember children running wild there We were having adult beverages  playing games  and having a good time This time  it was ridiculous It isnt Chuck E Cheese  yet thats how parents seem to be treating the place On top of that  the customer service sucked The place is gigantic  with tables and serving areas everywhere  yet on a Saturday at 6PM  the hostess told us after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess told us it would be a three hour wait  despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until youre table is ready  but the food at Dave and Busters is not worth a three hour wait on any day The hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table  so we attempted that Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games Next  i engaged in the most rudest thing Ive ever done  I began stalking tables where people were finishing up I would walk up to people paying their check  ask if I could have their table when they were done  and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line Finally  we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner It wasnt because we ordered a lot of food  it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks  until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water After that  he seemed to come around a lot less  I had the build your own chicken tacos  which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings The fixings were fresh  but the chicken was cold and dry  and the tortillas were dried out as well For $14  it wasnt worth it  After dinner we proceeded to play games  which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything  All in all  I didnt like my experience at Dave and Busters I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult but between all the kids and the crappy service  cant recommend this place If anyone asks me to go back  I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork
Not being from the area  I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown  PA I was excited I havent been to this Dave and Busters since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games I went with my cousins  mind you  we hadnt ate all day and were very hungry So  we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo  naturally Heres where it gets bad First of all  we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table Then  we waitand waitand finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress Her name was Ashley We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted  so we quickly put our order in Next  we were sitting and talking  waiting  we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time She said shed come back right away with our refillsyea  right 20 mins later we get our refills Mind you  our food still hasnt came yet I see other people getting their food that had come in after us I was frustrated After waiting 45 mins for our food  I asked to speak with a manager One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with Well  hes really busy right now I doubt hell be able to come out and talk to you Finally  15 mins laterthats one hour  folks We get our food What do you think the next problem was? Yep  the food was cold I was completely fed up at this point  and told my waitress how disappointed I was  especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service The manager never came to speak with me  and we didnt even receive our meals for free The only compensation we got were $10 game cards Woopty doo The only thing good about this place is the games  but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless So  in conclusionI DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD  PA It was horrible  and I will not be returning for a very long time
My boyfriend and I are in our 20s  and have visited this D&B multiple times After our visit yesterday  however  I dont think well be back When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this  then one left while the line was still out the door The girl that was left was more than incompetent  and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room Needless to say  the line in the game room was just as long  and they still only had one girl in the booth It was a Saturday After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming The floors were filthy with trash  and the bathrooms: repulsive I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit  and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them  but there was TP all over the floors  and the sinks were less than cleanly My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better  as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didnt work All I have to say is get your crap together We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be  and Im I have no doubt its due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends Its a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon
Ok Let me tell you about my bad experience first I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party   which  side note  is a great idea  It was around midnight and the bar wasnt really populated There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at Kind of counter productive if you ask me   I stood there for about 5 minutes  which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then  it just seems a little ridiculous I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away I finally had to walk to them to get their attention  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didnt ask if i need anything I finally said  Are you working? and they gave each other a weird look I felt like i was the crazy one I asked for a beergot the beer  In between that time  the other bartender brought food over and set it down She took a fry from the plate right in front of me and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar What the hell I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks   not an established D&B   I was just really turned off from that experience   The good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games This place holds some really good memories for me   Its a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it
I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront  but it has gone down hill over the years The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people Now  it is run down and many of the games are app related games Fruit Ninja and 3D Experience rides With such games  you cant even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens Last time I went  back in the winter  many of the games were broken  which made for a negative player experience I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future  but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets
I recently stopped there with my girlfriend and her kids to celebrate her daughters 21s birthday I ordered the fish and chips Dont order the fish and chips unless you want to lube your insides for months I know I probably got the one that got away and they refried it 3 times The outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste The fish itself was bland After a few bites I called over the waiter who was very nice and funny and complained by showing him how hard the fish was by tapping the fish against the plate making a loud thud noise He grabbed my plate and took it to his manager But before doing so asked if I wanted something else I said no I had lost my appetite The manager came out looked around and walked right out of the area I was thinking he would have stopped but didnt oh well The waiter took my meal it off the bill I have eaten there before and the food was good Sometime you just get one that isnt
My sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together This place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms All of the food looked great on the 16 page menu When our food came though  everything was below average They have a huge selection of games for the kids to play  but you pay dearly to play games here The food is  overpriced and the drinks are drastically overpriced
4 Stars for the fun factory  games  and all around experience  but 2 stars for the disgusting food and horrible service  I was SO excited to come here for my boyfriends birthday Its always fun to play games  win tickets  and have fun with friendsfamily We decided to eat here before we played I keep seeing commercials for their new menu  so hey it couldnt be bad right? Wrong Only thing that was really good was the Corona rita   but thats hard to mess up   First off  service was horrible I didnt feel like any of the areas were that packed to make the service so slow  but apparently I was wrong It took about 15 minutes  minimum  to get our first drinks At least an hour for our food I have boneless buffalo wings  which are hard to screw up  so mine werent bad but they werent the best My boyfriend had their Philly Cheesesteak and he couldnt finish it Was SO salty and just not good For the price of everything  it was not worth it all Better off going somewhere else in the Waterfront for food and then coming here to play Youll save $$  time  and frustration   I guess they are also remodeling their price area so for now there is a make shift area to cash in your tickets Everything was pretty picked over  which kinda sucked Overall it was still fun  and I am sure I will be back to play some more games
Can we get a maintenance man?  And a janitor?  And a manager?   No?  Ok  I had a good time at Dave and Busters  but that was based mainly on the company I kept and not the venue   We went right when they opened for the day  with the intention of playing some pool  We located the pool tables in an area that looked closed off  so we went to the hostess stand to ask  She radioed for help  got none  and finally went in search of an answer our question  When she came back  she said she couldnt find anyone  but a manager would be out to talk to us   We waitand waitand finally just give up and go off to play in the arcade area     All but one of the card purchase machines were rebooting  and the one we could use didnt work  It takes forever and finally gives up and directs us to a non existent ticketing attendant  So we again go off in search of someone to help  We flagged down a server  who issued us a card $56 for 375 tokens and served us a few cocktails average prices  though my rum and coke was teeny     And we are off to play some games  About every third game we tried was broken in some way  Either the token swipe didnt work or the game itself was messed up   It also wasnt the cleanest place Ive ever seen  They have tables around the place to set your drinks on  but most of them didnt look as though theyd been wiped from the day before which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all day  Overall  they appeared completely unprepared for opening computers booting  employees not ready to work  soda gun at the bar not assembled  etc and not well maintained or managed at all  The broken games were sort of comical after a while  but definitely not in a good way  If you are really looking to do this type of activity  Id try a different location for sure
Over priced  over hyped but a hell of a time regardless  I think if you have a big screen tv at home and a wii you could order pizza get beer and have friends over and have the same experience without the price and glitz  Ive yet to eat something here that impressed me  The arcade is a bit dated but I like playing the big trivia game more than anything again  you could just invite people over to play trivial pursuit  The new TV set up is pretty cool  but Dave and Busters is just what it is  an adult Chuckie Cheese not worth more than a visit a year  if that
I ate here for lunch today with my wife and 2 kids Server was prompt getting to the table  took our order and then disappeared Our food took 25 minutes yet there was only 4 table with people who were dining Grilled cheese  salad and a quesadilla shouldnt take that long Games were fine Mens room didnt have any paper towels to dry hands with Huge fail for this type of venue
I have been to Dave and Busters multiple times and i feel its a 2 star place  I can say the food quality is sub par  In my opinion the food prices are expensive for what it is and quality  They do offer a nice bar but then again the prices in my opinion are a little higher  Service isnt too bad  but could be better  D&B is a great place for adults for sure  but the prices for tokes or game play is a little ridiculous  Some games charge 69 credits to place  Thats almost saying $150 a game and some of those games are addicting where I know most of us keep playing    I also thing D&B isnt the cleanest place either  The bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion  Doesnt seem like they keep up with it  To me  thats a big factor in rating restaurants     All in all  D&B is an ok place to visit  but not a place i would frequently waste my money
The food here is awful  I came with a small group of people for dinner one night before heading out bar hopping at a few places at the Waterfront  We gave the server the benefit of the doubt because there were about 8 of us  which can be challenging  I think the long wait time to get the drinks and then the food was due to the bartender and kitchen  but the waitress really tried her best  I only gave it 2 stars because I liked my mac and cheese  Everyone else at the table hated their food  They all had sandwiches or other dishes  The one girl resorted to eating only the toppings off her sandwich because the bread was too hard to bite through  The kitchen probably made her sandwich right away and left it under the heating lamps for 40 minutes while preparing the rest of our tables food  I was tempted to stop and play games for a couple minutes  but after my husband came out of the restroom he told me how about 5 other guys walked out of the restroom as well that had not washed their hands and immediately went over to start playing games  All I have to say is no thanks
The food was good but we Waited an hour for our drinks then 15 hours food then an hour for our bill Wont be back Not busy at all so not sure what the problem was Id hate to be there when they are busy
eh i was disappointed the food wasnt so good and the place had a weird smell to it At least the waitress was pleasant Probably wont be returning anytime soon unless they make some changes
SUMMARY: If I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go  I might come back for beer and appetizers  GOOD:   Decent beer   Original pretzel appetizer  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip   Huge portions  Most of us had leftovers  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi story and way more food that we could handle  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack   Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drinkwater refills   Amusing name  BAD:   Lots of food choices burgers steak chicken salads  Lots of drink choices beers wines mixed drinks  I guess this could be seen as good  but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no ones awesome at everything  you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place   None of the food was super awesome  Nothing was awful  but nothing stood out in any way  Ive had better beer  appetizers  and a better main course at plenty of breweries   Kind of dead on a Monday night with 34 of the place empty  Come if you want bar food  but keep your expectations low
Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when theyre better than the beer I would have drank otherwise  One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as kind of like Coors Light  If I wanted Coors  Ill pay half as much and have one    The food is actually a saving grace  as it was pretty good  Head next door to Sing Sing for drinks  though
Lately  the Rock Bottom is hit or miss The beers are always good and the Uppity Jagoff IPA is one of the best India Pale Ales Ive ever tasted The low point lately has been the food I will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu That said  I ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived  the bread was as hard as a brick and cold The filling was okay  but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom
I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food  but in my opinion  I feel the bar is raised for places like this It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer  and slack off on the food Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category Lets be honest  when you go to a brewery  you want the full experience If it was only about the beer  Id go buy a growler and take it home   So  about the beerEXCELLENT The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head  but thats a matter of opinion The beer selection is constantly changing  and they always have some excellent seasonal beers You cant go wrong  theres bound to be a beer everyone will like   As for the foodits pretty much a crap shoot Sometimes its good  sometimes its terrible My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food One time its perfect  then maybe its cold  or its burned  or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it Unfortunately  it seems there is zero attention to food quality   Thats pretty much it This place fixes its food consistency  and its a five star place Till then  its hit or miss
I must admit  I do like the brews  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes  Other than that  meh  The food is pretty forgettable  Another brewery that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave  you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom  But how would anyone know to?  Its a chain  Whomp whomp
I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend  and it was nice to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit While the beer is pretty good  it has never outweighed the fact that the service isnt good and the food is average  at best  It was even difficult to get beers at the barwe tried to have the girls order  thinking theyd have better luckwhen that failed  the men triedthat didnt work either If we hadnt REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv  we wouldve just left It definitely wasnt busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender  so I cant overlook it Of course  the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom  so it was hardly surprising  Combine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink  and you get the exact formula thats kept me from going there in the pastand will keep me from going often in the future
Slow service Below average food  Ill pass
Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that  in my opinion  is just OK  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable   Their food is pretty much like their beers  forgettable I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really werent anything to write home about  I feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chilis of Brew Pubs If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite  or at least until the Burgatory opens
Went here last night to meet folks for a friends birthday party Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened  otherwise Id be fine giving this place a 3  Our waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled  the food was decent overall   I had a plain ol burger and a delicious berry sangria   and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be inyoud think this would just be another average place not great but not bad and Id be ready to go on to the next review right there  Heres where I ran into problems Id checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that arent  say  2 000 calories in one sitting Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that its a hassle for the people at the bar  so he didnt recommend it Then why tell us on your website that youll do it???   Additionally  while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurants ability to handle us lighting candles  apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for  and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available Obviously whatever error occurred wasnt the waiters fault  and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had   On a final note  this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger  they will overcook it; Ive started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done  Final verdict: go for the brews if you must  and the foods nice enough I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed
So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront  we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub  The place was pretty busy  we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left    So finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good  The service was OK  not the best not the worst  But moving on to more important thing  the food  Talk about missing the mark hugely  I ordered the mini street fish tacos  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish  and tomatillo salsa  They were just strokes away from inedible  I love fish tacos  I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked  If I wasnt so hungry I wouldnt have eaten them at all Lesson learn on that  The husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizzas and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings  For instance  he would usually just say  Chicken BBQ and cheese  nothing else  I refused to let him do that this time  because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie  And boy was I jealous when it came out  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water  Should have stuck with something simple    Furthermore I could care less if I come back to this location  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal  I know this is a chain  but it still doesnt have to stink
The food is standard American fare a bit overpriced in my mind and the beers range from mediocre to very bad  The Kölsch is the only decent beer of the bunch  The service is good  but the wait for food or a table can be quite long generally 20 30 minutes even for just beer and apps  Ive been to the one at the Denver airport as well  but I was stranded and had free meal tickets  so okay but nothing special pizza from Rock Bottom it was  Since its a recognizable national chain  I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft brew experience
The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL Ive tried many things on the menu  and if you have developed a foodie palate  dont even bother  because you will be very disappointed If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch which  nothing wrong with that you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas minus the repulsive beans and rice and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer Otherwise  you are better off skipping it
For this occasion I was with my girls  we were looking for a place to have a good lunch  We looked around and chose Rock Bottom  we have eaten then before and enjoyed ourselves  The server was a very nice person and was very attentive  She when over the specials and took our drink order   Going through the menu one thing that caught my eye was the BBQ Brisket Stuffed Burger  That just sounded so good  Unfortunately the reality didnt match the idea of the burger  The favor of the BBQ never came through and the smoked Gouda flavor was none existent It was like having a standard old boring burger  I was very disappointed  For $14  I would have expected a lot more flavor  I would not recommend this burger unless they do something to bunch up the flavor
Overpriced Food is OK  but way overpriced Quantities are smallmuch smaller than the picture in the menu The beer is average But yes  you guessed it  thats overpriced too
Was hoping for a great end of a day experience  but Things happen Waitress seemed to have forgotten about us  entrees came out prior to our appetizers Entree of fish &chips was a major disappointment  fish was soggy and the chips were cold and grainystarters were comped but I doubt wed go back Sad because it has the potential to be a home run hitter Two stars and thats it
Rock Bottom: A Cautionary Yelpers Tale  You might say  Ive never heard of Rock Bottom  theres no way that they are a chain restaurant Beer? Apps? Bros? Sounds like a good time  but be careful or youll end up on the rock bottom  After a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings  we were finally seated We could feel the tension from other diners that something wasnt right The manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps We immediately ordered a few apps but just like GOT  and now our watch begins  We waited and waited to finally receive the saddest  tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices The food was uninspired  tired  and ordinary The only reason why I am giving them 2 stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20% of our meal due to the terrible service   So if you have decided to take a seat at Rock Bottom  take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain
While this is certainly not my first meal at Rock Bottom  this is my first meal in a year or two  The wait was minuscule  and the greeter was pleasant As always it is a haircut weekend so the twin carnivores  the mother in law and I decided to tie the feed bag on at RB Our server Matt was easy to work with and informative   I started off with the tortilla soup Spicy and thick it went down easy enough However let me say that the price at $350 was rather steep for the serving size Did somebody say OUCH Thing one and thing two each had the small fry steaks  with fruit cantaloupe  melons  and grapes and steamed broccoli and at $675 each  I think I was buffaloed IF  you get my drift The steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of  Hmmm   They say that kids say the darnedest things well thing one noticed that his steak was very very gristly  and thing two noticed that his was rather dry Not the best dinner they have eaten They say you get what you pay for OR NOT    My meal consisted of the Chicken Bacon Mac & Cheese  and at $1475 I had no complaints It was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon How can anything be wrong with that much BACON   The final dinner consisted of chicken fried chicken and at $1395 my mother in law was sated Over all this meal was a wash If anyone from Rock Bottom corporate reads this You may seriously want to rethink you portion sizes   As you know I vote with my feet and dollars  and neither will be there again ANY time soon
This is another one of my favorite places that had deteriorated dramatically Corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck The menu has gone from something for everyone to a couple of overpriced entrees and a bunch of small plates that are ok but not great The service has also suffered tremendously We are abandoning this restaurant  I dont expect this Rock Bottom to be around too much longer  In the past  on nights when the Pirates were playing out of town  the bar and the restaurant would be packed  Last night  it was only slightly busy  You can usually tell when an eatery is suffering by the amount of staff on a given night and the conditions of the bathroom  The staff was overwhelmed and the bathrooms were filthy and in serious need of repairs  Alas  I dont think that Rock Bottom will still be in business in six months  Hopefully  if that happens  Black Rock Bar & Steak House will find its way into Pittsburgh
Stopped in for dinner an bellied up to the bar The bar tender was quick to get me a beer the 3 Pepper Ale which was really good but after that I was totally ignored Tried to get the attention of the two bartenders for about a half hour while nursing my beer They seemed to be more interested in changing dollars for quarters and washing glasses I got feed up  finished my beer  paid my tab and went to Unos Glad I did Got great service and my meal came quickly  Verdict:  sit at the bar for a beer if thats what you want but if youre hungry and want dinner take your chances at a table
Service is good  staff is friendly and knowledgeable Beer and cocktails are good as well Foodnot so much  My boyfriend and I shared the Jalapeno Pretzel appetizer which was pretty good  but our entrees disappointing  I got the Baja chicken sandwich and he got the bison burger   both were super dry i could not even finish half of mine He had to drench his in ketchup to be able to get the bison burger down If i were to go back  it certainly would not be to eat
Meh is the only thing I leave here feeling  I ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me  For a side   I requested the seasonal veggies trying to be healthier and was told its a squash mixture   great I love summer squash    I received a poorly seasoned burger The bun had the most flavor which is a sad statement  It was topped with an olive and a mini pickle odd  My squash side was lacking squash Instead all squash was replaced by peppers which I cannot eat  Our server was nice  The beer was simple  With new breweries and restaurants popping up in and around Homestead  perhaps RB should reconsider their flavors
Overpriced Food is OK  but way overpriced Quantities are smallmuch smaller than the picture in the menu The beer is average Butbyes
The place does what it does best   Comedy  The food  however  Blah  First off  If you go to a show  please note there is a two item per person minimum  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks  you are REQUIRED to choose two items each      Second  the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS  I learned that one the hard way  Get water   Third  before tipping your server  please make sure she hasnt already taken her cut out  Even after paying for two very bland  overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes  I thought that my bill was rather high  Upon further inspection  I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more  but there was only two of us and we werent even drunk  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%      Overall  I dont like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show  I can see why they do it  but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies  I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again
The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution some specific examples at the end  The setup is nice  a delightful if a bit sterile reproduction of what youd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and its an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh  Its too small  however  to attract many of the best acts  which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh Jim Gaffigan  Louis CK  Second City all perform elsewhere though they managed to get Bob Saget  to their credit  But the biggest problem is the food and drink  Theyre very up front about their mandatory two item minimum  but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show  The prices are well above what Id consider reasonable given the quality  and Id begrudgingly or even happily just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markupbut the food is bad  Youre forced to either a buy extremely overpriced drinks 350 for a soda  for example  with no refills or ten dollars for one with refills  or b buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldnt want in the first place  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable  until a few bites in I decided Id rather just throw away the money than keep eating it  Still  I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians  Two stars for now  with high hopes for improvements  A few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed: 1   A lot of the drinks didnt have prices on them  I know this isnt uncommon  but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors  its an incredibly poor decision here  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear  Its not that hard 2   Put the drink prices on the website too  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews  and she once said Our menus and pricing are listed on our website  which makes for easy planning  Im calling shenanigans  Not all the prices are on the website  which makes for difficult planning 3   Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like youre trying to trick me  Its kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to ones customers 4   Since the $350 soft drinks dont come with free refills  the servers shouldnt ask would you like a refill on that? or anything of the sort  They should ask would you like another one? instead  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying we dont offer refills  but Id be happy to get you another one  Just because theres a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesnt mean people all figure it out  Most patrons dont even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere like a cola or diet cola  and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings
My husband and I went to do something fun The comedy was great  The food  however  is mediocre at best In addition  we were seated in the last row  and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table  so that they were in front of us I could not see a thing When we received our check  they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification  I will not be returning anytime soon
We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wifes work holiday party We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged  almost brown iceberg lettuce  with some croutons and frozen then thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad  and I can tell you it was downright tragic Dinner arrived and since there wasnt any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu  we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked The pasta was overcooked  and the tomato sauce was just watered down puréed canned tomatoes I saw traces of onion in my dish but didnt taste them at all I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites Yuck I didnt make a dent in this crapfest For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake  which my wife ordered  and cheesecake  which I ordered The chocolate cake had freezer burn Inexcusable It wasnt edible The cheesecake was only a hair better  but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well I know people arent coming here for the food  but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements two drinktwo menu item minimum then at least make some halfway decent food It doesnt even have to be memorablejust not OFFENSIVE Which it was Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink  but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk   The comedians were good The venue was nice ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our event Not always the best thing in a comedy club we only got picked on a little bit But damn  I was hungry I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how Id rather be therehow Id rather be heating up a discount microwave dinnerhow Id rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunchhow Id rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteriawhat a dreadful dining experience  My car was also violated in the parking lot I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food  which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole  The Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company I truly believe thats the only thing that can save this place Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand  and just order a beer Well  two I guess Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so Id steer clear of those Unless there is a cant miss type of comedian here  I cant ever picture going back to the Improv Id give the comedians 4 stars  and the food ZERO stars
Sowe got here and seated by 635pm Orders placed Drinks served Now it is 752pm One of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich I had My shrimp diablo It was as described Spicy and good But hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable We also sent an order of chicken fingers backdryer than sand And my fiancés chicken Caesar salad chicken was as dry as the chicken fingers Barely edible  in fact  she didnt eat more than 3 pieces of it Upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better
Its sad that this the only place locally to see national comedy acts other than the big uns in the Cultural District I hate this places MO The space itself is fineonly a few blind spots  nice intimate venue They bring decent acts in  although they have a lot of repeats and need to bring in more new acts But the two item minimum just infuriates me Overpriced  shitty food and drinks We went to see Lachlan Patterson last night hilarious show  very nice guy  signed our CD and posed for photos with people We dropped $40 on a chicken quesadilla  6 hot wings  and 2 Yuengling drafts The whole time I just sit there thinking about all the amazing places I COULD have eaten for $40 Burgatory is right down the street Hell  TGI Fridays would have been better Ive been to other comedy places in other cities and they often have minimums but everything is either a lot cheaper or a lot better quality  The Improvs saving grace is that they often have free or very cheap tickets
Let me preface this by saying  I generally compare all grocery stores to Publix  maybe even Kroger That being said  the one thing Giant Eagle GE has going for it is the quality and selection of items There is no question that it has everything you could want Thats where the praise ends Lets just do this numerically  1 Prices are outrageous If you walk 100 yards over to the Target next to it  youll find some of the same items for 30 40% cheaper A bag of Gevalia coffee is $799 at GE  the same coffee at Target is $499 And its not just coffee  and not just Target Giant Eagle has little other grocer competition in Pittsburgh This being the case  if youre not near an Aldis  Target or Walmart  you have to go to GE for stuff Theyre banking on this lack of competition   2 Parking lots are thrashed every day  all the time Now  maybe you dont care But when I go in the morning  theyve been open maybe 30 minutes and there are shopping carts littering the parking lot and the sidewalk in front of the building They clearly dont bring them in at the end of the night They also rarely have any small baskets near the door  youll need to hunt for one Its just laziness and a lack of care  on both accounts They dont care about the appearance of the outside  nor the convenience for the customers   3 I dont normally mind the self checkout  but only if I have a limited number of items If I need a full grocery order  Im going to have to wait in line for one of the two cashiers working the registers  on a Saturday The lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious Im already paying exorbitant prices  but I also have to ring up and bag my cart full of groceries too? Walmart doesnt even make you do that  So thats about it If you dont mind paying much higher than average grocery prices  ringing and bagging your cart full of groceries and generally being an afterthought as a customer  than Giant Eagle in Waterfront is awesome
Barnes & Noble  its like the Wal Mart of bookstores  Beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike    Im not quite sure whether Im in a cafe  at a newspaper stand  a book store  a CD shop  a movie house or a flea market sometimes  With all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge its a bit hard to figure it out  Feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee  I dont know about yall  but Id rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this
I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing The Hangover at Loews across the street  Incidentally  The Hangover is one of the funniest movies Ive seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater  Okay  back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice  There are plenty of hightops  plasmas and a few booths  Its spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar  I ordered a guinness as usual  Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else youll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles  I sampled Robs long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender  The bartender herself was okay  not too friendly but quick enough with the pours  I dont remember her name which is usually not a good sign  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu  We started with the chips and salsa  The chips were crisp enough  but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out  which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louies Ive been too  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service  Maybe Im being too critical I tried to order the baked goat cheese  but they were out So  I settled on the hummus appetizer  This was surprisingly pretty good  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible  Its probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay  your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing  All in all this place isnt that bad  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and youre more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse
I had the EXACT same experience as John R Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street The place was near empty and there were three waitresses Got seated and waited on immediately Ordered drinks  and it took them 15 minutes to comeno  not alcoholic drinks  two waters and an iced tea This should have been a bad sign  but at this point we ordered food  20 minutes go bywe flag down our waitress  to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes She said our food would be out in a few minutes Another 20 minutes  still no food  and our waitress is nowhere to be seen We flag down another waitress  she says she will find our waitress  who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later She says she didnt even realize our food hadnt arrived well  you never even checked on us  so of course you didnt After speaking with the kitchen staff  she informs us that she definitely put our order in so it must have been given to someone else by mistake Because they wouldnt have noticed that that WASNT what they ordered? Seriously?  The waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and  since we were starving  we reluctantly agreed 10 minutes later  our food and the bill arrived All that was comped was the iced tea  and we got some free utensils and wetnaps How generous We shovelled what we could into our mouths  did NOT leave a tip thankfully  we didnt have the added gratuity that John had  and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food Worst part? I opened the wetnap  and it was totally dry Of course  However  I gave this place two stars instead of one Thats because my food  when I finally got it  was perfect I had the Greek burger and it was huge  cooked exactly how I like it  with delicious toppings I really wish I could come back here for the food buthell no
Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved  Remember when youd go somewhere and have good food  great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months youd go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you cant describe and the place is no longer familiar To me  that is Bar Louie  I cant say the food is bad I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale I will say I still ate them so shame on me My  sandwich the Mario as always was very good  Now here comes the bad:  1 There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer I understand that the establishment is an indooroutdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table  2 The place is enormous and they had one  very nice  but over worked server The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving  3 Because of number two our service in general was not good I cant totally blame the girl she did the best we could I mean Ive played Diner Dash on my iPad  I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working  Its sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again I think Im being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I cant rate it that low Part of me hopes it gets better  but like an absentee father itll just let me down again
This is one of those places where the presentation is nice  but the taste is too ordinary Friends and I went here for happy hour starting at 5pm They claimed to have $1 draft  $5 mixed drinks  and half off appetizers When we got there  we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items  so pretty much the discount was pointless We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers   I only had appetizers here so I cant really judge them for their entrées  but I will rate according to my eatingdrinking experience  I got the spinach artichoke dip It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing For a dip  it had way too many obstacles built in to it I dont know what they did with the artichoke  but it was super fibrousI felt like I was chewing grass   Overall  I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain Food was way too average for the high price
I am normally a Bar Louie Fan   my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa  This location needs a lot of work  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received  We got there at about 6:406:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up  but I would say that the bar was not even 34 full  There were also plenty of empty tables  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction  But we grabbed a table  I am not a clock watcher  so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5 7 minutes  Then we got our drinks at 7:04  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour  That went out the window  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks  We finished them and left  The server was nice  that is not the issue  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were  They had two bartenders on I think and not nearly enough cocktail servers  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks  but explained it away with this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped  That is a sign that you need more staff  I have never had this happen at any other bar before  Get more staff  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time  not the fact that we did not get HH pricing  Even though  in my opinion  they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:507:55  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there
The food was okay The noise level with 10 people in a huge room deafening Awful acoustics
Eh  this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowdoverall experience for a Saturday night  Bobby and I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar Tip: if you sit behind the taps  no one will bother to acknowledge you exist When we moved seats  we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats It wasnt all that busy  either Most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were It seems that Bar Louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decorneon blue lightingextensive martini list Maybe Im just salty about the wait
Really the only thing good about this place is the happy hour No one wants to pay $8 for a glass of wine that is a short pour and bottom quality
I dont frequent Bar Louie  and I really dont plan to change that any time soon Ive eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just havent been super impressed by the place  The food has been decent   a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it  glutton that I am   but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never wowed me And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often  the problem is that things are way overpriced here Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly  not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like dont qualify for the happy hour discount  which is disappointing Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here Not even a large one  either Sorry  but I find that to be kind of ridiculous  especially since theres cheaper places to get drinks in the area  Still  the food and drinks are definitely a ok albeit overpriced  so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here But good Lord  theyre just so loud I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard Not cool  Bar Louie Not cool  So while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places   and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I dont expect to be back in any time soon
Food was 7 out of 10 for this type of bar  restaurant Service was extremely poor and bar service was also extremely poor Untrained and understaffed bartenders will keep me from coming back No reason to not be able to get a drink when sitting at the bar
Good drink new old fashionedFood was so so shrimp tempura app  but service was NOT good and I think it may have been amateur night in the kitchen Food took a long time to arrive for a simple fried appetizer   approx 20 mins with zero acknowledgment from my bartender  Shrimp were cooked well  but sauces were extremely salty & sweet to be paired with tempura batter  The bar is drafty and customers other than me were complaining with no noticeable change Im not staying for a main course
I wanna love Bar Louie  I do It seems like even on the deadest of nights it takes 20 minutes or more for a waitress to even show up at our table and get a drink order from us The food is good  but the past 3 or 4 times Ive come theyve been out of tater tots by 9 PM  and Im always told after my order is put in and the kitchen decides its now time to tell the wait staff theyre out of something It may be time to start frequenting a different location besides the one on the Waterfront
I absolutely love the ambiance of this place The bar area is very large  and there is even some upstairs seating with nice couches and whatnot A solid beer selection at reasonable prices makes you want to come back It doesnt generally get very crowded even on Friday and Saturday nights  so dont expect a South Side type of environment   All that being said  there is a reason why this is a two star review Even though this place doesnt get crowded  it takes a very long time to get served I have waited up to 30 minutes between rounds while sitting at a relatively empty bar
I only go here when I cant get into Burgatory and because I enjoy the outdoor area with the firepit which is a pretty cool atmosphere  Their really unhealthy food options like the loaded fries or loaded tots are pretty good  but their healthier food options are really lacking  I tried to get the blackened fish tacos and the fish was really dry and overcooked and of poor quality  The tortillas were completely stale and hard and had large gashes down the middle  They have a decent beer selection but when I asked what their seasonal Great Lakes on tap was they said the Christmas ale its the last week in April now I knew that if I ordered that draft it would be quite stale as its probably been in there for 6 months now  so I got a Southern Tier instead which was good  The service is ok but rather slow  Overall Im pretty underwhelmed by this place
The evites are in the mail for the 2 for $99 special You will have to spend $24 on a parking pass I signed up last year for this promotion and dont think I got the passes worth   The waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day There are just too many misses in my book though  1st off all Traffic is a biatch Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am   Next remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place Im not a mean kid hater my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool   If you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that WILL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they wont use them because they run around the park all day I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid I was like Im an adult and you need to have some respect He pushed me and took all the chairs I only needed one and his mother did not correct him I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs overTHAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time Damn FOR REAL  Sandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak Plus they are so sugary If you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes An Adult area would change all this I dont even care that Im getting splashed all the time I do realize that Im at a pool but its hard to relax  If you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go If youre trying to go on the weekend forget it The weekdays are bad enough Im looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer
Its fun  but not as fun as Kennywood The boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that makes for a lot of shoes onshoes off events The lazy river could be much better I did like the water slides and the Potato Patch fries  as well as the scenic location
I have the season pass and go atleast once a week and each time Ive been in the last week Ive beendisappointed Two weeks ago they threw a rubber baby in the wave pool and entice panic and claimed iy was a training exercise Disgusted And today twice the pool with mushroom and waterfall in it was shut down due to adults pooping in the pool or puking dont know cant get a strait answer from any of employees Just sad there customer service sucks
This was my first time back in about 12 years  I havent been here since high school so its hard for me to compare 12 years ago to now  I do know the prices have gone up but i can remember paying $19  I think the best thing you can do is purchase the tickets at giant eagle or even looking on the sandcastle website for deals  My sister for a deal for 1999 and day in the 2015 season  I  paid 2699 at my local giant eagle  Thats not really a big deal    I am definetly shocked that there was a $6 or $12 fee to park I mean its ridiculous we have to pay what we pay to get in and another fee to park is crazy  We opted for the $12 fee to park real close to the entrance bc of having a 7 year old with us  It is worth that extra $6    I learned that you should get there and line up at the game fairly early if you want a good spot by the pool People with plow you over and run to get a prime spot  That is a downfall  Plus this means that there are a lot of RUDE PEOPLE  We got there early enough to ride all the rides we needed too  we didnt do the lay river however because the lines were RIDICULOUS    The wave pool was a hit for my son but just watch all the people there  People are rude there as well  Some horse play and such   I must comment on the food  i def love potato patch fries but the prices are crazy I ordered 2 chicken tender meals with fries and the costed me around 35 with drinks  THATS is BS    Sandcastle is an ok place to visit  but its just not worth the money
Fried rice super bland Chicken was slimy Service was indifferent  No repeat visit for me
Meh  Ive experienced better is an understatement  Fridays is like the fine dining chain for every yinzer in Pittsburgh  1  When we were seated  it was quick which was a surprise  Somehow this restaurant gets packed and I never understand why  I was happy about that 2  I ordered one of their skinny margaritas  blackberry to be exact  It was a nice size  however  at $600pop  that was half of my food bill 3  The waitress started off attentive  but after our food came out she was gone  I ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard  Loaded mashed potato on the side because I wanted heartburn ha 4  Food came  My burger had lettuce on it only  Waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks  I had to wait to ask for my pickle 5  The loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what I was expecting  Disappointment 6  The waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check    Never again will I eat at Fridays  I will  however  go should a happy hour arise
This place Is ok if ur grabn something quick  But they do have a great happy hour tho
Im not opposed to chain restaurants but this TGI Fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the chain expectation   I order the Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp with just fries The fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder The shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried The chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer Even the water tasted weird  Fortunately  we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly   Id recommend the TGI Fridays out in South Hills Village over this one any day
I had a gift card so I decided to use it for a to go order The food tasted frozen and microwaved Nothing special just around average
Went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner The server was very friendly  but seemed a little overwhelmed Maybe they were short handed  The food was to me not even average I ordered a burger  which very overdone and dry Had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it  My friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle  then put cheese and one jalapeño slice on each piece Imagine 6 half moons of taco shell  Not like any nachos Ive ever seen  and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them
I understand its a chain  and pretty standardized everywhere you go  but I found this location to be especially bad First  when you walk in the restaurant has a very stale grease smell that permeates throughout the restaurant  nothing visibly dirty  but smells like the entire joint needs de greased Second  the service  the host was a typical younger girl  efficient without too much professionalism  not a big deal The waitress  a professional   but unfortunately not in the way of experienced great service  but moreso as experienced in efficiently moving things along  Our food took a long time  and she saved herself by telling us that she didnt know why our food wasnt ready yet  but would check again  and of course  hot plates with luke warm food came out soon after She reeked of cigarette smoke  so im going to make a dumb assumption and guess thats where she was  The food  typical TGI fridays food  good enough  for a chain restaurant  Extremely unlikely that id return
Fridays seems to have gone down hill I was quite surprised when we went and there want a wait I thought we had lucked out We were seated quickly and our server came over quickly There was only one other table that had people in the section we were in  I ordered a Jack Daniels burger cooked medium Our food came quickly My burger was well done and dry Without the Jack Daniels sauce there was no flavor at all  The fries were pretty good I was sad to see how far down the quality of food had gone  Thankfully our server did a nice job
I dont care what Cub and Bulls fans think  this Steeler and Penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that First  the crust tastes like a biscuit  and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza I will give UNOs a thumbs up on its flatbread  its better pizza than some pizzerias In the area When I look over unos menu almost nothing excites me  this place is a dud Guess what? Chicagoans dont know how to eat hot dogs either
I really dont know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore  Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine  I really cant find anything to eat in a place like this    My husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront  and we needed to find a place for lunch  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us  My husband is a meat lover  so I agreed to let him order us a meat covered pizza  To counteract this a little  I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad  so wed at least have some vegetables in the mix    When the salad arrived  it did NOT look like the picture  The menu description is thus: chopped lettuce  roma tomatoes with basil and garlic  buffalo mozzarella  drizzled with balsamic syrup  This description is accompanied by a bright  colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce  bright red tomatoes  and a delicate drizzling of balsamic syrup  It looks light and yummy  What we got  however  was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce  COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing  a total of four tiny pieces of tomato  and some cheese  It was DISGUSTING  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish  it was more like a soup than a salad  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown  they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing  Not only was it disgusting  but it cost us about $10  $10 for complete inedible slop    The numero uno pizza we got was nothing to write home about either  It was ok very mediocre  The crust tasted like it was undercooked  and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever  I have been to Chicago many times  had real Chicago deep dish many times  and this just doesnt even come close to the real thing    The ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there  It would be better if theyd actually print it on the menu  but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort  They are making strides  too  with their whole grain crust options  Im sure theres still a lot of room for improvement  however  If youre listening  Uno  please work on providing your customers with healthier food   not just healthy options like salads  but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers low fat cheese  low sugar sauce  less sodium  etc   Their hearts will applaud you    And lastly  why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I dont know about?  Its baffling
I really love deep dish pizza The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside The spicy  peppery sauce that can singe your tongue The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth That being said  I really dont understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonalds has done to hamburgers  Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza  Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza  and Taco Bell has done to Tex Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable On our menu:  French onion Chicken bites Pizza with pepperoni  hamburger  and romano  Looking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature  the food just was not good Dont get me wrong  this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten  but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed  overhandled  and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good   I really never want to return
Food was ok had a steak w shrimp side Ass mashed potatoes Everything was ok not a lot of flavor
Pizza ok on its own nothing great  Definitely not worth the restaurant price  definitely not like pizzeria UNO in Chicago Are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark
The menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive For 2 personal pizzas the size of pizza hut 2 beers and 2 salads  we paid over $50 bucks The personal pizzas alone were $11 each If you want pizza and beer go somewhere else pasta appetizers  or sandwiches this place is good
Was very disappointed with the food It was overcooked and not seasoned very well
Nice place but some of the items on the menu are not available unless you get a 2 for 12 but thats not what the online menu states And its a salad come on
The only reason to come here is because its a fun place to eat It sure isnt the food   Too much dressing in a salad that didnt even fill the bowl Like so many before it  UNOs is making me leave hungry It was a salad with Walnuts  Goat Cheese  and Blueberries  and while it was good  there was absolutely no value in this meal One of these days I will learn to stop eating at big chain restaurants  kind of like not shopping at big box stores   Its a nice atmosphere and generally crowded and loud Some would call it fun and I think it is But  sometimes its worth a little extra to get what you really want and need in a meal Thats what adds value   In the future these places will be relegated to the last ditch effort when nothing else is available Only in a pinch
REDO  I went to PF Changs several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me    My issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food    My resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat  So we returned to PF Changs for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant  There were very few people in the restaurant  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:  Coca Cola Iced Tea Pan fried pork dumplings Sesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup Changs chicken with white rice  Our drinks and my soup came out immediately  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times  but at no point could I get her to come back to my table  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table  I didnt know what it was and didnt want to know  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup I didnt expect to get the stink eye  My egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils  The server really wasnt that into the experience  but again gave me the stink eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself  I mixed the rice vinegar  chili oil  chili paste  and soy sauce my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup  but it was still brown  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didnt wow  I saw no reason to continue  I moved on to the dumplings  which had an okay flavor to them  The skins were a bit thick and doughy  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old  stale  or rancid  We finished our dumplings  Our lunch entrees arrived  I had ordered mine extra spicy  but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot super mild and had a lackluster flavor at best  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else  I tried some of Changs chicken and was equally mollified  This was supposed to be their version of General Tsos Chicken  Now I have never had a Generals chicken that was the same at any place  It is always different  Many of them are good in different ways  This food  though  it wasnt good  Changs chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken   since it tasted mainly of soy sauce   with the addition sugar    I just dont understand how anyone can like this place  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at SamsCostco tastes better
Stars are for the food only    25 rating  Got there at 8pm on Saturday night  they told us it was an hour wait which was expected  but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me nowFYI love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory  I had the Singapore rice noodles  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp  plump  juicy  tangy with a small kick    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick   The service was annoying   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished  I found it rude especially since  there wasnt even a line at this point    I think we will travel elsewhere following a movie  The result never quite met the anticipation
Sadly Ive been here a few times because its a crowd pleaser when my girlfriends parents come down to visit Theres nothing really WRONG with it The portions are big and the food is alright and the interior gives you the superficial impression that youre encountering fine dining  The food is sooooo bland though Everything you get at PF Changs you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and itll be made with more precision and have better flavor The honey chicken at PF Changs was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks  Last time we were there the server was horrendous as well I dont think Ive ever felt as awkward at a restaurant He brought my girlfriends father Don his unsweetened tea then told him he didnt bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey my girlfriend and I could order he had already started to walk away We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order not in an uncivilized or malicious way  either After that he must have thought we were terrible diners I dont think Ive ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work  or ANYONE for that matter and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died  Obviously the attitude of one idiot who cant hide his bad day well doesnt really have anything to do with the restaurant But its soooooo bland Go somewhere else for Chinese Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and itll give you a variety of good  local places to choose from at half the price
The service was lackluster Coffee was warm but delicious Limited to one cup  apparently  as the waitress never offered a second  Daughter had sweet and sour shrimp Wife had spicy chicken I had wonton soup Dumplings as an appetizer for the table All arrived warm The brown rice was dry as sand and the white rice was delayed by rice cooker problems Also dry as sand I guess that is how they serve it  The base flavors for the shrimp and chicken were nearly identical I had expected them to be more diverse   In all  expectations were not met for what is advertised as upscale Id rather have the local Chinese cuisine which more flavorful  and much less expensive
I really enjoyed my Mongolian beef and pork pot stickers  but  There was NO presentation of pfc mixing sauces  One of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill Non franchise is PRESENTATION and experience  I was extremely disappointed by the LACK of presentation   Reservations: Our party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations  At 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party  Obviously someone dropped the ball here  When we requested silverware for the table Our waitress blamed it on the hostess Yes  theHostess should have provided silverware However It was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck As a Patron I could care less whos fault it is; just $&&in fix it Defiantly took away from my pfc experience  My Hot and sour soup is usally served withnoodley things that I drop in the soup We werent given any noodley  things  Not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isnt selling food as much as they are selling an experience This experience is what sets this restaurant apart
Let me start by saying that I do like their food   Last night I went with my wife and two guests The apps came out fast and were fantastic Dinner on the other hand  didnt come out quickly at all The rice was undercooked  and we told our server He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order By the time I was almost finished with my meal  another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice is that the way rice is prepared now?  I ordered the chocolate cake I asked for a container to take half home The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one  she said we can just squeeze it in there  and started to flatten the cake She then realized that a larger one would be better  4 people  not crowded2 hours total
ok so ive eaten here more than once but just thought to write a review on it now  ill be honest this is the only one ive ever been to  so i dont know if theyre all the same but every time im underwhelmed i get there  look at their giant selection and get excited then i get my meal and remember that ive never had anything too great dont get me wrong  its not bad  but for how much they charge  they really need to step it up or at least give me a huge portion just saying
Our last few visits have left something to desire  One of the things I always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees These people look miserable  no one smiles or greets you appropriately  its more like get in  get out  turn the tables   The food has remained consistently good when we can order it the last time JB and I came for a quick dinner  the place was not busy yet we were passed by 6 frowning waitstaff without getting drinks for 15 minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table HINT  HINT so we left and most likely will not be returning
If you look at other reviews you will see that I am a very positive person  but tonight was an utter disaster  We sat at the bar and the female bartender  was miserable We ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did  She spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took 3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty We ordered appetizers and they never came out  She actually brought us our check and we never got our food By the way we were the only people at the bar  Finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed We payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready We finally got seated by the windows Do not sit by the windows because it was very cold We ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks After our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot Nothing was comped and no manager was available This PF Changs needs new management We will never return I will give it 2 stars because the food was great  but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders Steer clear until changes are made Its not worth the headache
I seriously dont know why people love this place so much  the food here is horrible The rice is never cooked properly And its not even Asian food Its fake asian food I never come here anymore
This place has gone downhill and I dont expect that we will be going back In fact  I dont expect it to be in business past Christmas They raised their prices  changed the menu  and removed several of our favorite dishes from the menu The veggie dumplings are gone  the jasmine iced tea is gone  and the mini dessert are gone The food is meh My broccoli was mushy in the ginger chicken and the sauce was like candy because it was too sweet
Disappointing : I expected more out of PF Changs All I can say is that there is better Chinese at a non chain place  and it is cheaper Wouldnt go back I you want Chinese go to How Lee  or China Palace
Ive had bad experiences here a few times now  I wrote panera bread and havent heard back  Bad service all around  Basically  we ordered our food  they ran out of what we wanted  so just decided to make us something else with out telling us  When we got our food  we asked why they made us that instead of what we ordered  oh it was the closest to what you wantedhmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay  and how about you give us our money back  Really  you dont get much for what you pay for at panera  Its not very good at all
Panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant I have ever been to I have posted two pictures of the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad The first one looks delicious the second one looks like they couldve used a smaller bowl It did not even look appetizing
The problem I have this experience compared to my last is that the examination lasted 3 minutes  The vet checked the ears  teeth  and nails then called it a day    I came home looked at his teeth and saw my pup had a slab fracture  which was still attached to the gum  The vet didnt mentioned it during the exam other than telling me to buy a finger brush to brush his teeth  I was primarily there for a vaccination shot but if theyre going to charge me for a examination  they should do a proper examination  I just felt I was rushed out of there   I took my dog to another vet where they told me about the slab fracture  gave me info on how it usually happens  potential problems that it can cause  and recommendations on ways to fix the problem
