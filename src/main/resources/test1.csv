wing sauce is like water pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce franks red hot maybe  the whole wings are good size and crispy  but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better the hot and extra hot are about the same flavorheat  the fish sandwich is good and is a large portion  sides are decent
owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money  i dont think i ask much out of a driving range  decent mats  clean balls and accessible hours  hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls  this place has none of them  it is april and there are no grass tees yet  btw they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month  the mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt irenes house  worn and thread bare  lets talk about the hours  this place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730  it is still light out  finally lets you have the pit to hit into  when i arrived i wasnt sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation  there is no grass on the range just mud  makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball  oh  they are cash only also  bottom line  this place sucks  the best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in pittsburgh
this place is absolute garbage  half of the tees are not available  including all the grass tees  it is cash only  and they sell the last bucket at 8  despite having lights  and if you finish even a minute after 8  dont plan on getting a drink  the vending machines are sold out of course and they sell drinks inside  but close the drawers at 8 on the dot  there are weeds grown all over the place  i noticed some sort of batting cage  but it looks like those are out of order as well  someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be
my fiance upgraded his phone at the apple store  but got a strange text on his new phone about his plan we went over to the verizon store to see what was up  and that was about as pleasant as having forks jammed in my eyes awful customer service no one came up to ask us if we needed help we had to tear a disgruntled man away from looking at his instagram feed to help us he didnt say there would be a wait or to sit or anything  just said okay then and left us so we stood there waiting for help or even just directions for far too long  were ignored and told him we were leaving awful awful awful customer service
waited over 45 mins  2 people ahead of me and im finally getting helped  wtf??? i can understand them being busy but that was ridiculous  i work out in robinson and went to the settlers ridge location and boy  what a difference  they were awesome  in  out the door in 20 minutes  i ended up with a new 6s and my wife ordered a 6splus all in less than 20 minutes  ill never go to this store anymore
dont go here this place is a scam when it comes to opening  freezing  and canceling your membership it is not easy or convenient and they get every last penny from you for a mediocre gym with sweaty smelly locker rooms go to la fitness bad experience here
used to go there for tires  brakes  etc  their prices have gone way up $400 for 4 mid level tires for a toyota  plus  1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks  since they dont make appointments   the wait to get the tire looked at was  2 hours  sorry cant wait that long to get a warranted repair   they lost my business for good
i got new tires from them and within two weeks got a flat i took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched  but they said the reason i had a flat was because the previous patch had blown   wait  what? i just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? this was supposed to be a new tire  i took the tire over to flynns and they told me that someone punctured my tire  then tried to patch it so there are resentful tire slashers? i find that very unlikely after arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said hed give me a new tire this time  i will never go back to flynns bc of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire
terrible preordered my tires and when i arrived they couldnt find the order anywhere once we got through that process i waited over 2 hours for them to be put on i was originally told it would take 30 mins slow  over priced  ill go elsewhere next time
last summer i had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time i also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on they fixed it for free  and the very next morning i had the same issue i called to complain  and the manager didnt even apologize so frustrated never going back  they seem overpriced  too
dont waste your time  we had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck one of them the owner  both times  we never heard from them  not a call  not the estimate  nothing
i can;t believe this place has a high rating i had a bichon  who was seen here since his puppyhood and who was dying i called to make an appointment to have him put down because he was in great pain the receptionist would not give me an appointment until one week later  even though she could hear him crying out in pain anyway  he died in agony before his appointment this was in 2010 and i have not taken my subsequent pets to the clinic
never go to rossi tailoring and dry cleaners 393 vanadium road pittsburgh  pa 15243 i decided to use a local business to do my dry cleaning i dropped off 3 shirts at this establishment just before thanksgiving it is now late january i have stopped by more than a half dozen times and have been given only one of the shirts they have offered $20 a shirt for the shirts they lost those shirts are worth at least $50 each  and i refuse to take under $30 for each i am tired of the run around  tired of promised phone calls that never happen they have never called me  i wouldnt use their services again if you paid me to
station is closed  sign is blank and all fixtures from the store have been removed
thomas darby i will never stay at this extended stay america due to the fact that we were there in october  2015 and had an awful stay room was only cleaned one time after asking three times when it would be cleaned there was absolutely nothing in the supposedly full kitchen  2 wash clothes  2 hand towels and 2 towels we had to take used wash clothes and towels to front desk every day to receive fresh ones the toilet ran over and the heater didnt work until we decided to leave we were over charged after booking through hotelscom and had to put up a $10000 deposit for what? never again will we stay there
if i could give this place less than one star  i would i have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked the decor is tired and grimy  the place reeked of smoke  and the bartenderserver was surly  to put it mildly we went there on a saturday night with a mind to try the irish food apparently  we were out of luck ive always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat he told us before we ordered that they had no pies no chicken pot pie  no shepherds pie  etc so  we gamely tried to order other things we placed our order my wife  for example  ordered the irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party at that point my wife picked out a third option  ham and cabbage  only to be told again that they were out at that point  realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus  we asked to pay for our drinks and left they actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card in short  unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression  id probably avoid this place like the plague speaking of the plague  i suppose we should thank mr surly for inspiring us to walk out i only have two bathrooms at my house and wouldve been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once
the delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell  having confused 133 and 113  rather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation  he begins to accuse my wife and i of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza  the driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed  begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges   so i take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order er was  phone my neighbor and discover the mistake rather than a thank you or a sorry  he just speeds off breaking the speed limit on our block to reach his destination 50 feet away  i would call to complain  but based on the other reviews  its clear the owners do not care about carnegie or its residents  and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is  so it would be pointless to boycott a place id never order from again anyway  do yourself a favor and order from any other establishment in town
some of the worst pizza ive ever had  we used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut sicilian first of all the pizza wasnt even cut through  and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide  while the others were about 4 each the toppings were scarce  they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza the onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can the worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll im serious it was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it it was gross   we also ordered steak and italian hoagies the veggies were old and wilted  and there was no dressing on either the italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous the steak if you an call it that was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces no flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam it was so bad that i only ate 14 of it and tossed the rest   i have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed i thought i would give them another try since id never ordered a sicilian pizza from there what a mistake i will never order from them again
unprofessional  we ended up here due to being recommended by the insurance company it was my fault for leaving an ipod in the vehicle  but regardless it was stolen the owner would not take responsibility for the theft  and firmly stood by his employees he did say that the cars are occasionally left unlocked outside the building bad practice  nonetheless  i am out an ipod  and he is out everyones business that asks me for a recommendation for auto repair lock the cars
im an elite yelp member and i try to say positive on all local businesses   that being said i can positively say stay away from this body shop i was with nationwide at the time of my front end accident and they told me to go here because they were part of their blue ribbon program in my eyes this meant that this shop had clout and were a reputable shop what i didnt realize this meant was that nationwide would basically get substantial discounts in return for them sending most of their bodyshop repairs this way   the owner and his wife run the shop my accident happened in 2011 i called them and they told me to bring it in they took pics and then sent me on my way told me it would take about a week to get the bumper  side fenders and new hood in they would repaint and reattach they also ordered new headlights  showed up a week later the only positive aspect was they took pics which were available online to show the progress of the car throught the week  after a week i picked it up it looked okay he never replaced the undertray which was damaged in the accident which would lead to problems down the road he also forgot to cover the back of the car which got some overspray from the primer how this happened when he painted the front of the car is beyond me im assuming they were painting a car next to mine  here is where i am dissapointed with his service after a week the bumper started falling off also the new headlight he put in started getting condensation in it which proved to me he never actually replaced it i called and tried to set up an appointment but none of my messages were answered after getting him on the phone he told me i needed to set up an appointment to come look at it i showed up and he told me it would take more money to fix are you kidding me? the insurance company and i coughed up $6k so you could partially put it back together and then not want to fix it once it was falling apart? he told me i must have hit a curb and knocked the bumper off he would not take responsibility for his lack of quality work   do not go here i complained to nationwide to remove them from their repair shop list but my complaints went unheard  i ended up going private party to redo his shotty work
by far the worst most unprofessional dentist i have ever experienced her staff is too busy watching soap operas on all the tvs in each room instead of cleaning and she gave me a filling which was too deep which could have been understandable as her son had his pictures delivered from hawaii and she had to stop 3 times to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a 14 year old go to hawaii on her moms dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen i had to have oral surgery and have the tooth removed because she put the filling in too deep an abscessed tooth was the result i wouldnt recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone i hate because of the three months of extreme tooth pain i had to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after i called and asked them for advice and follow up they simply could care less and did not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribing me vicodin and antibiotics do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pulled
in all fairness   i did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minutes for them to open  when i look at yelp reviews  i usually weed out the outliers the best and the worst   unfortunately  there are only two reviews  it was my first time at the office   the office admin very nice asked for me to come early before 9am to complete paperwork   i arrived at 8:50    i waited   i watched 2 employees walk by me unlocked the door and re locked it    they did not acknowledge me  the door i was at had signage open hours    i decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presence  the office admin very nice called me to inform i am missing my appointment   i explained to her that there were too many indications where this was not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of luck  i recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door furthest away from the parking lot for the entrance  poor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review
ive been to this office a good amount of times  each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable  dr weinberg herself is very nice  but i doubt her ability every procedure she has done to my teeth has backfired the third and last issue i have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visits and somehow i have received an invoice for $55 i called and of course the receptionist was sassy and rude so i gave up will never go back or refer anyone else
take it from me; avoid this place at all cost  the only time i go is when i am starved and dont have the energy to cook or get edible food  and then after i have been kicking myself
i use to order here fairly often  the past 2 years their food has been getting progressively worse every time i order  it doesnt help that the owner that always is at the register is so rude to me every time  i finally decided that im done  i dont think i should feel let an inconvenience when ordering food from a restaurant  let alone one that the food isnt even that good also the inside is dirty as heck  they can deliver food in a bmw but they cant buy a scrub brush?  i have found golden dragon in collier square is 100 times better then don don
they gladly have you come in for a consultation cleaning just to tell you they work on children  but when you try to get actual work done on your child they all the sudden refer you to childrens good scam to get that cleaning visit from patients but dont do any work i will be looking for a dentist for all 3 of my boys that actually works
i spoke to a man this morning about the ice covered parking lot and sidewalk  as a business is liable to their customers if someone was to slip and fall due to negligence on the businesss part he told me good luck and that im liable to just be careful because everywhere is icy after two years at this gym im fed up with the way they treat their customers he told me he was fed up with me since i gave him a hard time about being out of towels a few weeks ago which theyve had towels since then they never clean the parking lot in the winter so make sure you wear boots outside and dont crash your car aside from that  this gym is well just that a gym my biggest critic aside from rude management and negligence would have to be that they dont encourage sanitization outside of the cardio room there arent towels and spray around the weight machines  which ive never had an issue with  but id hate to see that happen i always make sure to at least wipe off my sweat marks from the machine  cause well thatd be pretty nasty it is pretty large in terms of size and space to do anything aside from the ordinary weights and cardio the workers well theyre mostly young and dont really care too much the man who told me i was wrong was older and possibly a manager or owner they tend to not keep on top of the wash with the towels even when it isnt busy  which can be pretty annoying their cardio room always has fox news on two tvs and then the middle tv has sports center on regardless of what else is on tv they recently havent even been putting pens games and stuff on must be too busy watching the 52 inch screen they have in the lobby for the workers while the cardio room has max 32 in the middle and 24 on the sides probably if i had to pay full price for my membership i probably wouldnt belong here  but its through my insurance that said i dont swipe my card like most people in the front on my own the machine is behind the counter one guy always shows me how to do it myself  which was helpful the first time cause people arent always around the front desk that said when he is standing behind there chatting i would expect him to do it since its his job this gym is nothing state of the art fancy fancy  but do you really need a fancy looking gym? their cardio room is pretty massive and even at peak hours ive never had a problem getting a treadmill or elliptical they actually even have two hellix trainers  which arent super common yet sometimes when things go out of order they take a while to fix them ive run into the owner or manager one time in the bathroom when someone let a sink over floor and asked if i should tell the guys at the desk and she said oh no theyre useless this gym makes a killing from a classes b its convenient and c their personal training is a separate company warrior fitness ive been meaning to sign up for a trainer and i always see them busy they all seem awesome and very helpful and challenging not sure if they have a separate yelp page  but i would say from what ive seen theyd bust your ass for sure
terrible service  food unremarkable  waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement  saved his tip by discounting meal after i complained  all and all  a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests  not to be repeated  never again
i have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times i wont go back the first time we were there almost 3 hours it took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty when i complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order it made no sense  how could we order when the waitress wasnt coming to the table? after arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200  bill ridiculous if it were up to me i would have never returned unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight again it took a long time to get our food my food was cold and bland  my kids food was cold my husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting the wedding soup and bread were good  but thats it my drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when i asked bad food  slow service and rude managers ill pass on this place if my family decides to go again not worth it at all with all the other good italian options around
we stopped at papa js last friday night 81 for a round of drinks there were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening  one member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall  as it was fairly busy that night in the short time that he was there  a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else he then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order she said yep and then abruptly turned and walked away at that point  he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later when my friend told him of what had occurred  the manager said what do you want me to do?  my friend said an apology would be a good start whereupon the manager looked back at him and said get out and dont come back ???????? are you kidding????  my friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants he was not screaming or belligerent in any way  shape  or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred   that being said  we left and went back to 131 east  where we had previously eaten the service there was fabulous  as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite  there are new restaurants that have opened in carnegie as of late papa js is no longer the only game in town  obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management appalling  do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of papa js they understand the concept of  customer service
food was not good at all my husband  i ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time i ordered a salad  basil pesto cream pasta  my husband ordered the spinach  feta pasta the salad was just a huge plate of spring mix nothing else in it with way to much vinegar dressing my lettuce was drowning in the vinegar my pesto pasta had no flavor did not taste like a cream sauce to me  the pesto was so runnywatery  way too much sauce not enough noodles my husbands pasta had even less flavor than mine we ate about a quarter of the food  couldnt even finish it we took it home  it was so bad i didnt even eat my leftovers and i hate wasting food plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get  of course the poor quality dont waste your time eating here there are much better italian restaurants in pittsburgh
had dinner with a friend my friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage the waitress was extremely rude he never did get the correct meal when we talked to the manager  his answer  was  well what do you want me to do fire the waitress? too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude
we visited on 1115 with a party of 15  while i know a party of 15 can be overwhelming  we did call in advance for reservations thus  allowing proper staffing we arrived early and headed to the bar the bartender there greeted us quickly and took great care of us when it was time for our reservation we were seated immediately that is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst we sat for 20 minutes before a server came to our table at that point  she said ill grab you water and bread  another 10 minutes go by and members of our party went to the bar to grab drinks as the server vanished still no water or bread she finally comes back to the table with bread no waters and takes our drink orders about 40 mins into sitting at the table next thing we know  a nice gentleman by the name of patrick is our new server he really stepped up the service and should be commended however  we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold we also ordered the incredible white pizza which was incredibly cold while patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible not once did the front of house manager come check on us  this is the second time ive visited and the 2nd time ive been disappointed also  i wrote to the restaurant and received no response
ive never posted a yelp review before  this meal was so horrible that i downloaded the yelp app just so i could warn others to stay away  we ordered food from capri since we were going to voodoo brewery  we ordered a cheesesteak with no mayo and an italian calzone since the person working there talked up the calzones  we ended up with a cheesesteak heavy on the mayo and an italian wedgie  which was just a folded up pizza full of mayo and onions  no sign of italian meat to be found  no marinara sauce  it was inedible  we ended up walking to kfc instead    i want to leave a zero star rating  but yelp wont let me  so they get an undeserved star
any time ive ever stepped in to randys  there is a very odd smell that immediately makes me want to turn around and walk out bartenders dont seem friendly and if you arent a regular  expect to get weird vibes from the regulars  with all of the other options in the area  take your money elsewhere
you would think their exorbitant prices would at least buy some decent customer service not at this location   they are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything this is a problem because they carry so many completely different products that its hard to find what you need expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistance  the organization is disjointed  especially depending on your project theres even a section called art supplies i thought that was kind of the point of the whole store   what did it in however was how miserably they packed my picture frames the place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glasses in paper to protect them  but apparently michaels thinks a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather   so  the inevitable happened and i dropped the bag now i dont expect every place to be sympathetic  even though it could have been packed better  but when i asked for a refund they were down right rude hey i did drop the thing  but some empathy would have been nice i wasnt completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place i will never be back to this or any other michaels
this is the absolute worst steak n shake ive ever been to   the bf and i got lost around pittsburgh for 40 min trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food  the food itself was just so crappily made it was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time cmon  steak n shake is basically a glorified mcds  our waiter comped our whole meal  if not for the compensation  i would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal the bf  on the other hand  was more upset about the principle of the matter we had trekked all that way just to get our steak n shake fix since both of us havent had it since our undergraduate days and it was a major fail  i think im good with my steak n shake craving for a long time now    ps the whole joint smells like major bo
i went here at 3 pm between the lunch rush and the dinner rush  and the restaurant was maybe 20% full i ordered the chili mac supreme to go i thought i would be in and out within 5 10 minutes keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drive thru; the expectation is quick service  long story short  my food never came the waitress told me after i had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes that the kitchen hadnt even started on my order yet  so i told her to cancel it and walked out now i see that others on yelp have warned about the slow service at this location wish i had looked it up earlier
the only thing worse than the food is the service
this was the most horrible experience at a restaurant i have had in years  i was there at around 9pm  with about 9 folks from my family visiting relatives included  there were several things that got me annoyed  one after another  i was ok that it took a while for us to be seated but after we ordered  what really got me angry was that the food took a very long time to arrive we had 2 kids with us and we ordered 2 kids meals  and had asked for those to be brought sooner after about 25 30 minutes of nothing  i went to the servers who were just not paying attention to us anyway   the main servers name for our table was angel and asked where our meals were one checked with another  who then informed me that they were working on it  what made me even angrier is that they tried to downplay everything  telling me that it had only been 5 minutes then one of the servers manager? tells me that ok  may be its been 10 minutes  but its coming then i hear some of the servers talking about our orders the same gentleman then came to our table  sat down next to me and told me that its only been 10 minutes and that they were working on our order  and tried to give me some explanation about why thats not really a long time at all it was clearly almost half an hour or longer by that time  the food finally arrived about 10 minutes after that but the food came cold  we were so hungry by that point  we just ate whatever we could neither angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even once i had to ask for mine  but by that point i was in no mood to take a sip even  i paid $5820 and i again got the same gentleman who tried again to explain to me that it was just 10 minutes  and that given everything  we were within normal limits wow  after about an hour and half at the restaurant  we all just shook our heads and left   i have written to them on their website  and will see if they follow up   we have vowed never to go to this restaurant again yikes
terrible wait staff  couldnt even seat us before we  and another party walked out without even being greeted properly  i observed several employees traipse out the front door  several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time   several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables  a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other i think one server was high       going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long ish illness  so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging
food is good  what youd expect from steak n shake the service is awful so incredibly awful expect to take at least an hour for your meal  even when its slow ive been going here for years when i want a cheap meal  but the service is so so so awful go to mcdonalds
the service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service i had a bus to catch so i couldnt wait around waiting for the check so i went to the counter to pay she never brought my check  never checked to see if my drink needed refilled  she just mopped the floors   the burger was really greasy  the fries were luke warm and the cheese on them wasnt as flavorful as it should be as a new pittsburgher im not impressed
i should have known better than to stop here  but i was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple  i should kick myself for thinking of this place  granted i decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait  the sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it  i sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared  during that time i wished i could have taken back my order and also wished that i hadnt paid already    while sitting at the window i decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job  what disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes  making a milkshake isnt that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch  what disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them  i mean smelt them to see if they were clean  instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container  after witnessing this my food was finally ready and i drove away  when i finally got to eating my food i was underwhelmed  the fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered  the steakburger really  they should just call it a burger  was overpowered by the bbq sauce on it  it was all i could taste  all this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again
you know what youre getting with a steak n shake: its about one rung up from a mcds in quality  and about two rungs down in quickness at least  you think you know   i used to have a small place in my heart though the salt and fat werent very kind to said organ for steak n shake  because hey  who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? but after my last trip  i can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here  this location in particular i havent been back in over year  and i will never step foot into a steak n shake as long as i have an immune system that i care about   after having eaten here  i hit the restroom on my way out along with my two friendshey  were girls  its acceptable one stall was already taken  so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does hershall we say  business? after a few seconds  we realize that shes not only there to relieve herself  but to also take drive through orders yes  thats rightyou want fries with that? flush okay  that will be $550 i have never  ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive through restroom to top it off  after finishing her bathroom break  she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant i guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didnt have time to wash her hands and i was in too much of a rush to choke back up what i had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach
i love steak n shake this one  however  leaves a lot to be desired the food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best most of the time  theyre downright rude i highly recommend avoiding this location if possible theres one on route 51 thats worth the 15 minutes itll take you to get there
i like the occasional steak and shake stop    but this one has to be the slowest one ever    the cashier was rude and i could hear her yelling are you fucking kidding me because the register was not working the way she wanted     wow just wow
every time we come here the service is laughably bad on this visit a tabe which was sat after us had their food before our server graced us with her surly presence good restaurant elsewhere  just avoid this location if you want to get your food inside an hour
wow dirty and slow  the floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over  and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order
the staff is very rude at the drive thru to the point of telling me at 2:02 pm its only 1:59 you cant do the happy hour shakes yet   she literally screamed it at me   the management does not enforce any kind of health code in that restaurant either   i too  have witnessed employees not washing hands  and i have gotten food poisoning twice from undercooked burgers   once   shame on you  twice   shame on me   wont go there again     the lovely occaisional drug deal out in the parking lot at night doesnt help either when you have kids
this location is terrible the drive thru workers are rude and they give you crap food i waited 5 minutes before being able to order  even when there was only 1 car ahead of me then the lady proceeded to ask me if i would like anything on my burger  and thinking the pictures on the menu are what theyre supposed to look like and they would never false advertise i asked doesnt it come with the fixings like in the picture? she then told me it only comes with cheese so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger pulled around and got my order pretty quick  but later when i open my burger its just meat and cheese the meat is badly burned and cold it was clear to me this burger was not fresh i didnt even attempt to eat it  what a waste of a place they definitely need better workers
awful in every category the service is the worst ive ever seen we were waiting to be seated in this half empty restaurant for 5 minutes before the manager came over and seated one couple then with more people waiting he went to the counter and took out a rag and started wiping it down we were still being ignore until i told him it was alright we didnt need a table and left i dont know how corporate keeps this place open ive complained numerous times but it never does any good  take the extra 20 minutes to drive to the south hills location its pretty much the exact opposite of the waterfront the food comes out hot and properly cooked and you are not ignored by the staff
i really dont know how this place stays open ive been here a couple of times the service is slooooow they bring you your food which is never the way you ordered it  put your bill on the table and never come back to check on you if the place was packed i could understand but its usually about half full on our last visit it took us 10 minutes to get our waitresses attention we asked for some mustard  mayo  lettuce  and tomatoes for our burgers it took 5 minutes to get the mustard and mayo the lettuce and tomato never came  its safe to say that we wont be back we like the food and shakes but not worth it to put up with the poor service
if could give toys cunt of a human being sue a manager negative 1 000 000 negative stars i would now i own a business so i understand management this stupid asshole from the second i walked in the door disrespected me   talked down to me  then refused me service from the why do you wantwith accompanied eye roll  for no other reason than she was doin five peoples jobs i do five peoples jobs sometimes and thats no excuse for how she treated   and its treating me as i write this in front of her she just threw my receipt at me  rang me out  and threw my change in my hand then threw away my receipt so it would be harder for me to contact corporate i didnt pick her job if she hates it so bad being responsible for other ppl  then maybe her smart fucking ass should pick a new career i will make it my lifes mission to get her fired for this because im pretty sure the camera dont lie middle finger
the hostess jenn of jess  im not sure is atrocious i am autistic and asked to be moved from right beside the kitchen because of noise levels  and she made a huge deal of it i ended up crying outside waiting for my partner to let me know wed been moved 15 minutes later  we had still not been moved or gotten food  and my partner and i left this is 1:45 pm on a thursday not at all busy just bad service our waitress was very polite  though
i have eaten here before and never had any problems but today was completely different i arrived 12:15 pm to have lunch with my family we sat there for about 25 minutes and not one person came to ask us if we were ready to order they completely ignored us so we got up and left one table near us had to flag a waitress just to get her attention so we went to  wendys up on 8th avenue and we had no problems ar all
i know service speed isnt a chain wide issue this place is just really slow we ordered 40 minutes ago still no food
he was incredibly sexisthomophobic he could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didnt like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls
entertainment great bartenders can be asses ordered 2 beers  2 jaegerbombs  total was $23  second round of same with an asshole bartender was $27 then the third of the same was $25? what a damn ripoff
i didnt like the customer service of this body shop there price estimate for my repair was outrageous they wont be getting my business
ive gotten a few more estimates since i wrote my original review i found that joe dilorios repair estimate was three times the price of the other auto body shops if you dont believe me  check yourself
when making a customers paymento atlowes  we have our checklist:  1 do the phone numbers match?  nope  but thats fine since people are always changing their phone numbers anyways 2 does the name on account match name on check?  nope  but mistakes happen at those pesky check companies 3 does the account number on the check match the account number on the screen?  why should it  those computers are always making mistakes  now that we have verified that all the information is correct  we can process the payment  the customer will be so happy that we didnt have to bother them with any silly questions   i am sad to say that this is an actual occurrence  what was originally an average lowes has turned into lowes hell  if the associates do not have basic logic comprehension  how do they survive?
would like to give no stars  bought all new kitchen appliances there  refrigerator is defective  they send an outside company to repair  man arrives with no tools and wrong size seal for freezer  not once  twice  the first time  he tries to use my spoon from counter to install it  i complain  too badthey have to comethree times before replacing it  never again
before today i probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however  today the service was terrible we waited two hours for a pizza sub  french onion soup  fries  and buffalo chicken tenders about an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders ie  no hot sauce we were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong  but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it she sent it back by a half hour later  we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders  nor the french onion soup which should have been mostly made already  and no fries  we were told the chef was new  but no effort was made really to make the situation better no quick and easy app or beers on the house to boot  the beer was pretty expensive i will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection  but it wont be for a while the food has always been average at best  and the pizza sub was no different we ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order
the food was absolutely gross i ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado  bacon  and turkey breast what i got was totally different from the picture first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread lame there was no avocado  1 slice of bacon  no lettuce  and to top it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking lunch meat lol no  not the kind that you get from the deli  the other sweaty nasty looking stuff gross   our waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so i would have a bit of an attitude if i had to wait 10 tables without assistance too     the manager was really nice of course that disgusting sandwich that i didnt eat was free
mediocre service cold food our food waited so long the lettuce  pickles wilted bland food crazy overpriced long waits in the arcade 1 beer per hour maximum  avoid at all costs fair manager
this place just plain sucks bad management lost them biz dumb arcade drama   they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old
visited the dave and busters in homestead  pa last night waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs charged them already too   both incorrectly my brother had to walk around and find out who it was waitress never apologized gm was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out did nothing to remedy the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit   not even a refill after spending over $300 plus games  we will never go back whatever happened to the customer is always right? horrible service
most of the games were out of order and i had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits  apathetic service staff all around  the peanut and i were really disappointed  wont be back
to keep it short and sweet: save yourself $100 buy a good board game  your alcohol of choice  order a pizza  and invite your friends over   what an incredible disappointment after seeing the enticing commercials so many times  we decided to give this place a try on a double date i understand the prices of the play cards and wont dispute them; however  the food was incredibly over priced  came out cold as in  sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes and i literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink it was pure juice $38 for three shots that had little no alcohol in them not to mention  my glass was dirty  and i saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop i know the food and beverage commission would be as disappointed as i was the service was terrible dont ask for anything from your waiter  as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves   was it fun to be in an adult themed arcade? yes if youre looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games  i suppose i would advise you give it a shot i would never recommend their food  customer service  or drinks save yourself the money and stay home  or go for a traditional bowling  figure skating  roller blading  rock climbing  basically any other physically entertaining themed date instead
i was here on 103 and i have to say this was a horrible experience  me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards  it took the waitress at least 10 15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again  we ordered and got our drinks and well lets just say we didnt see the waitress again until she was giving us our check some manager delivered the food to the table  no refill on my beverage  no how is your food  no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered  lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people  i will not be back again to eat
we checked in at 7:00 pm on a saturday with a group of 19 for a birthday gathering  we were originally told 9:00 pm is when wed be seated  but thats not the problem  because we were able to play before being seated  we actually didnt get seated until 10:00 pm  only to be told the kitchen was taking 3 hours for peoples orders  didnt see a manager until after 10:30 pm  needless to say  we didnt stay to eat and went elsewhere
ok  we went on a sat night with a large party  2 hour wait for a table fine thats understand then it turned to a three hour wait once seated we were told the kitchen was three hours behind and the wait for food would be three hours the manger blamed us saying  you came with a large party on a sat night  if you only order apps and not separate  meals  you might get food in 45 min really ? its the customers fault your staff cant handle a sat night rush the table of 5 next to us waited 3 hours for food  when they got it it was the wrong food i will never spend money here again to top it off the bathroom had no toilet paper and there was pee everywhere
awful awful spent 15000service was terrible took 27 minutes to even be acknowledged really the only saving grace was the kids had fun and the hostess took amazing care of us
the service at the pittsburgh location was so incredible awful that i actually took the time out of my day to write online how disappointed i was  which i have never done before it was a saturday night and as someone who works in a restaurant im very sympathetic when it comes to service we sat at the high tables in the bar area and we did not get greeted or even acknowledged for 30 minutes i personally had to get a manager and explain to him the situation and he treated me like i was stupid maybe because im 17? also not to mention the little girl next to me is balling her eyes out because she told her server of an egg allergy she has and they still managed to mess it up and give her food marinated in egg last i overhead they are heading to the hospital im not writing this message to be spiteful  im writing it in hopes that the future of your restaurant will improve theres a big difference between service and hospitality and right now this place is lacking both my best wishing for improvement
worst experience at a restaurant  waited 45 minutes for a waitress to come over and tell us that they changed a rule and that to eat in the game room you needed to be with someone over 25  when we had eaten there 2 days prior without any problems  when 2 of us are legally adults  will never go back to this place  i highly recommend red robin across the street
this wasnt the cleanest place dirty paper towels all over the womens bathroom no changing covers on the changing tables to change your babies very disappointed when i came here compared to the other two ive been too also they arent following corporate policy which ok  but when i asked about it to one of the managers on the way out  he said he didnt honor the first responders discount like the other stores do which ok is fine  but he had a very sore attitude towards them very disappointed in his attitude more then anything
worst service ive ever had we waited for over an hour for our food after the waitress walked by 6 times without saying a word or refilling our drinks we got a manager who had her come by and apologize and give us a round but never said a word about our food and told us her help never showed up we waited another 30 mins for our food before we asked for the check for the 2 drinks we got we left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food no apologies nothing while sitting there we noticed 2 other parties walked out as well they didnt even get their drinks i would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat drink play games fine i will never order food there again
went to dave and busters to eat no food went to dave and busters to play no games then i thought id wet my whistle with a cool glass of h2othey even ran out of water some lady even yelled at me in line to purchase game tickets accusing me of cutting line such hostility dave and busters? more like beavis  butthead smh
this is a place id go to just for the games the food was bad i had the chicken sliders and there was two pieces of wood in the sandwich which i found in my mouth granted the manager did take off the price of the sliders but everyones fries were lukewarm my sister got the chicken fingers and wow  there was zero flavor or seasoning on it the bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky the waitress was nice but overall i wouldnt dine here again
this is the wendys that made me never want to eat at wendys ever again  to think i gave it a second a third and even a fourth try  i guess convenience gets dollars but after so long  youll stop getting mine  the employees here are always fighting when you go in about shift changed and duties and the attitude carries itself right over to the register  the management isnt any better telling me to go somewhere else if i dont like it then  this place is the reason people scoff at giving $15 a hr to fast food employees  the frosty is never frosty always runny  the burgers are slapped together and the dining room looks more like a daycare after a long day than a place you would want to sit down and eat  the only good thing about this place is the exit so you can swiftly leave and never come back
tried going twice twice i got a  were closed i said i thought you were open till 1? nah it was 12 i thought wendys advertises that theyre open until 1? like thats their commercial campaign guess not cant rate the food cause i havent received any i would have loved to try but since its 1210 guess they are closed dont worry wendys maybe you should add 100  sodas to this location but dont worry i wont have any from this one or any i am done w this franchise
it took an hour to get our food when everyone else got their food in five minutes they forgot two of our drinks and one of the employees said a cuss word infront of a child
if there was a way to give no stars i would horrible service was given a time frame or 45 50min for delivery  after waiting an hour we called and was told food was on the way they sent the delivery guy out with 6 orders after another 30min we called back and was told pizza was still there because they ran out of part of our order they said theyd bring it right away waited another 20min we live about 15 miles away from the place still nothing so we called back and asked for our money back they never once apologized and every phone call they were trying to talk to another person about a whole different matter and oh since we used a card its going to be 3 4 days to see the refund at least pay cash so when they dont show you know you wont be ripped off at least
if you want terrible pizza go here save money go buy a frozen pizza and it will be better than this place
horrible beer  horrible service  horrible menu
my friends got everyhing from steakthey didnt even get a well done steak right to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables  give it a miss sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else after we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and i had ordered meal that came with a desert really dissapointing all around
for a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes  sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to germany not worth $595 unfortunately the sausage platter was $1595
came with my bf we started with the crab artichoke dip it was very greasy and had virtually no crab the wedge salad was good and crisp i had the hazelnut crusted chicken this has to be one of the worst dishes ive ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken to finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re freezing all around disappointing
be careful the servers cant pay attention to save their lives  and the management cares even less i want to make sure people know how careless the management is  particularly mark who seems to let his staff run around
very disappointing menu pseudo mexican and south of the border fare i had the beef tip sliders what a ridicules offering each one 2 on a plate had a nickel sized piece of beef on an oblong  3 bun it was taken back to the kitchen  after i complained  and a thin sliver now appeared the only thing good about this experience  the waiter was nice as the raven said  never  never more
terrible customer service  disrespectful in fact i towed my vehicle to master muffler in the evening the owner called me at 645 am the next day and gave me attitude for leaving it in his parking lot he told me he wouldnt work on the vehicle and that i had to pick it back up by the end of the day i said this was a secondary vehicle and i asked if he could be fixed at his earliest convenience  he said it doesnt work like that  never going back again  and i would advise against master muffler to all others
went to see bret ernst one of my fave comedians  tickets say seating begins at 9pm for the 9:30pm show  well  a line had formed outside because they hadnt opened the doors  that is all well and good if it is summertime but it was 4 degrees  people stood out there upwards of 20 minutes  freezing  they didnt let people in because they claimed the room was not ready  seating is first come  first served  whoever designed this place should be shot  there is no lobby to hold people before a show  the improv in cleveland is superb  that location has a huge lobby and bar where you can mingle before the show and they have ushers seat you  the pittsburgh improv is a disaster layout wise  beverage service was fine  it got really  really warm in the room and even the comedian was sweating like a freak show  of course bret and bill crawford were as hilarious as ever but man  this improv  as a comedy venue  sucks
in the market for unsalted cashews? how about oyster sauce? ahhh  heres an easy one: bean sprouts?  well if you are  keep a crystal ball and rabbits foot handy if youre planning on shopping at this giant eagle because youll need both a soothsaying ability as well as a fair share of luck on your quest at this dive   for a store of this size  they are frequently out of stock on items as common as jalapeno peppers to specialty foods items like flat rice noodles maybe im the only person in homestead buying these itemswait that doesnt make sense  theyd be in stock if i were  do yourself a favor and either go to the greenfield  regent square or kennywood giant eagles all three stores are much smaller but seem to stock rare items like unsalted or as of late sea salted xochitl tortilla chips and honey nut cheerios
this review is specifically for the dfs cleaners at this giant eagle location  i dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once i really should have known better  never again  my items came back completely covered in lint  i could let this slide  however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger  the weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins  being that its a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in  theres no way that i can wear it again  this was an expensive skirt  completely ruined  very disappointed  again  this review is just for the dry cleaners  the rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other ges ive been to in pittsburgh  just dont take your dry cleaning here
this is a review of the pharmacy after having them screw up a third time i felt that others should know that this is a pharmacy to avoid the first time they misread a prescription and gave me the wrong dose of synthroid  about 110th of what i needed i ended up so sick after 2 weeks of taking too little that i was half dead before the problem was caught their response when i told them was to say oops and it wont happen again not even a sorry  and it never did happen again bc i went to costco after that this latest time was classic i came with a simple scrip costco was closed so i went to giant eagle after 45 minutes the finally inform me that they cant fill it bc the scrip isnt specific enough it was for a common antibiotic  nothing complicated they didnt bother to call me earlier or tell me sooner  just made me wait and wait and wait until i pitched a fit to tell me that they couldnt fill it it was late and i went to rite aid in sq hill with the same exact scrip and they had zero issues filling it quickly wtf? how can it be easy peasy at rite aid but giant eagle cant even muster the effort to tell me that they are too incompetent to fill it out? i wonder if there is even a legit pharmacist working there at all it seems like they arent even staffing the pharmacy with trained techs  just random people off of the street   dont waste your time  or risk your health go to any other pharmacy in town  avoid giant eagle
went to barnes and noble waterfront with 3 books on my list       first one there were several books by the same name so they wanted the name of the author  went to look it up on my phonebarnes and noble wifi had blocked me  wanted me to sign it and allow them access to my informationnot  long story short they only had one of the 3 books i was looking for and it was $4 less on amazonlost this customer
the words epic fail get thrown around a lot these daysbut i really feel like they apply in this situation  we went on friday  april 2 and arrived at 5:10pm  it was busy  but not crowdedno waiting for a table  half price apps and drinks   we ordered at 5:20  the food just appetizers  mind you didnt arrive till almost 6pm  drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow  we placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15they arrived at 6:52  37 minutes for beer  by 7:00  we were canceling food orders which wed given up on after waiting almost an hour  we just wanted to leave  instead of comping anything  they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills  uhhhh yeah  thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back   we finally were able to leave around 7:30  bar louie:  you are dead to me
we were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm the 2 of us got to bar louie at 8:30  we sat outside  and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order  i tried stopping a waitress but was told this isnt my table  finally the waiter took our order  1 sam adams light bottle  and one pineapple juice vodka  after about 15minutes another waiter maybe the manager i dont know asked if we had been waited on we said yes  and told him we had been waiting  he left  and another different waitress came to bring us our drinks they were wrong my date was given vodka on the rocks and i was given a sam adams  they took these back  and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served we told them to bring another round and the check  it was 20 minutes before they returned and they forgot the check  by this time we had to go to be on time for the movie my date asked for the check again so we could leave finally they brought it and i gave him my card  when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie  for 2 bottle beers  and 2 pineapple juice   vodka i was charged $3103 i didnt have time to complain or ask i wont be going back
when the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 youd think you could get service  nothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons i very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first i came here on saturday ay 6pm almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didnt have drinks in the 15 minutes i was there i counted 9 waitress again i counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order just from the looks of it i could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck so after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies
i was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice  sunny day and we decided to drive to waterfront and walk around all around great day until we hit bar louie for some drinks and appetizers  i am giving it one star  though it deserves none  because our waitress was nice  if a bit inattentive  and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good outside of that bar louie leaves a lot to be desired  this is probably the first place ive been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks to me  that is beyond ridiculous bar louie is not an upscale restaurant  as much as they wish they were  and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined   as i mentioned the waitress was friendly  but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough i really wanted to like this place because of things i had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good  but if it want to spend that kind of money  ill go somewhere that i can get good service
i came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie  and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food unfortunately  i cannot because the service was so bad that i left before i had the chance to order we found seats at the bar behind the taps after sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged  we thought that they might not be able to see us  and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar  grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order it was fairly busy  but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks   everyone was seated and im sure they face much busier times we sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes i timed it   i am not exaggerating  and were not even acknowledged you would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could  but despite staring him down almost the whole time  we could not even make eye contact i hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out
the absolute worst service i have ever had at any bar or restaraunt  and  in looking at other reviews  i am not the first  there are many options at the waterfront  and i would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place
servers are chatting  not paying attention to tables i can see my salad is ready at the window worst serves ever
meh  i just dont see the appeal bar louis has to pittsburghers i guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the waterfront stopping in after a shift its always packed being so close to the amc theater  they get traffic before and after movies   its expensive  the food is so so before i get ahead of myself  i had the bbq ranch chicken salad without chicken the bbq ranch dressing was very good  but its very easy to duplicate at home its equal parts ranch dressing and kc masterpiece hickory bbq sauce and a drop or two of worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce   tuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight  daily drink and happy hour selections  but even thats not enough to get me here skip it one caveat for this location  free parking at station squares location you gotta pay to park the jalopy  im eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when burgatory opens across the street
we stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie our server  was friendly my husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me both drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol  after i finished my drink  i used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find to my disgust  a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap ugg did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap? she comped the drink but we wont be back cant speak about the food since we didnt have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself
i cant even review this place we sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order  and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left and i have to be clear it was a saturday afternoon  maybe like 10 tables with people at them and i saw 3 waitress walking around i think its probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant  especially since burgatory just opened across the street
well its 9pm on a tuesday and no tater tots dip for the chips are cold and beer is room temperature not very happy will try the station square bar louie next time
my friends and i went down to the waterfront to enjoy some shopping and have dinner everywhere was pretty busy so when we went into bar louie we were not upset it took at least ten minutes for a server to come to our table he immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks only another 30 minutes until he brought one martini over we ordered our food and after talking to management it still took 45 minutes and our order was messed up we tried to be understanding when we learned it was only our servers first day but you would think that management would try to help the poor guy out he didnt get out of the weeds for the 2 hours we were there very disappointing and embarrassing on managements part we werent the only people having horrible service because when we looked around the bar everyone was upset i hope they will let the server get some more experience rather than feeding him to the wolves on the second day
sign stated seat yourself so we should have know the service would be horrible from the moment we walked in  we originally sat upstairs  which was open per the sign  after 20 minutes we got up and went outside after 20 minutes outside and after the waitress taking care of and making small talk with the table next to us  we said screw it and walked  the one other time that i had been there the service was so so  i will never go back  why should i have to try to track people down to pay for a meal??
should have checked the reviews before we went ive been to real bar louies in other cities this is not one of them was seated for 20 min and no wait staff came to take our order several of them made eye contact but did not feel the need to ask if we had been waited on awkward then someone came over with two plates of food trying to serve us we thought  here was our big chance to get served  but no  she just walked away so we left there are so many restaurants where you can get burgers  just go someplace else
worst bar i have ever been to they used maybe no alchohol in their drinks and consistency had no meaning here we ordered three berry mojitos and they were different significantly i posted a picture  you judge
i went with some work friends before catching a movie later that night  we got to bar louie a little over 2 hours before the movie started  which left us with hardly any time to spare by the time we were done  we had a table right away and the server took drink orders  but it took 15 minutes to get our drinks  she then disappeared for 30 minutes before coming back to take a food order  the food took almost an hour  and we had only ordered a couple appetizers  the portions were really small for the price  and most of the food came out burnt  i did not risk mentioning it at the thought of waiting another hour for new food  again  waiting for the server to bring the checks after the meal was an ordeal in itself and took much longer than it should have    the place was busy  but not overcrowded  what i would expect on a typical weeknight  there is no excuse for the poor service and food  on top of that  the restrooms were extremely filthy and clearly had not been stocked or cleaned recently  maybe it was just an off night for this place  but i do not plan on going back again and taking that chance
the worst bar and the worst service in the area if i could give it 0 stars i would there is not one positive thing i could say about any times ive ever been here it has now been added to my very short list of places i will never step foot in again please take your hard earned money elsewhere
dont waste your time with this place  long lines  overpriced and no shade or cooling spots while you wait half the rides were shut down youre better off with a garden hose save your money or buddy up to someone with a pool
insanely expensive $6 parking $8 locker $9 wrinkled  burnt hot dog i really hate this place kids received season passes for christmas present brought kids once and will never return spent $46 on food and threw most of it away
boo  what happened to this location?  it used to be happy and fun  it just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  so sad
came here the other day for a late lunch with a friend the place was pretty dead and we were seated right away took 30 minutes for our waiter to show up and we just order both drinks and food then took another 30 minutes to just get our drinks 2 beers on draft and tables who were seated after us were served much faster then us finally our food came soup  salad  boneless wings  and fries a different server delivered the food and it looked like it had been sitting out for awhile after being given our food we were completely ignored  along with others in our section us and two other tables waited over 45 minutes just to try and ask for our check one table just got up and left   being a server myself  i try to be very understanding to the wait staff but this was ridiculous  the restaurant was not even close to busy and my section of about 5 6 tables was ignored
awful everything from the bad service  to the diluted soup  to the lame no chicken on the chicken salad  to the pre fabricated pizza avoid this place
well  it started well food was okay deep dish pizza was good but the salad we had   too tiny portion we were greeted and seated well but later the service was not all good bad bad service first of all we had to ask for everything we wanted the server didnt even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts she just handed over the check when we even didnt ask for it we wanted to order more later when we talked about this in the front  the girl there also just listened and said okay  not even a sorry once i would not like to go there again :
how does this place still exist of every place on the waterfront    i wont lie  i do like their lobster bisque but every time ive gone its just over priced  average quality with semi ok service  skip this place all together and get pizza at pizza company and take it home
possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is  nearly $20 for a pepperoni pizza for two would be okay if it were good   crust is extremely dry and unflavorful  if you want a good deep dish pizza  try burghs pizza and wing pub in bridgeville   their deep dish is thicker  tastier crust  better sauce  and a lot more cheesetoppings   cheaper too  service was just barely adequate on this visit
interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already i would normally not review a chain retail store  but the service i received today just really got my blood boiling  i will state  as i always do in these types of situations  that i have worked many years in retail i know what youre supposed to do i know the ways ive displayed exemplary service and i know the ways ive slacked off i get it  i really do  so im in the store early hardly any people in there weird for the semi annual sale time of year usually it doesnt matter what time youre there during the sale  its always busy   i went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras since no one was at the check out counter and i needed a spot to go through things  i set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick i actually always like to do this  just to shoot the breeze  but also to get their opinions on items im buying   the girl behind the counter was having non of this thoughi asked her about a bra and she said she didnt know about that one  but said it should work i understand  you cant try them all but the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter i even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me ghost town tumbleweed rolled by no one  so im going through my stuff and separating what i want and dont want and shes sighing and grabbing things saying soooo  you dont want these??? um  im not asking you to help me sort things im not holding up a line im just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental xs pair of undies that got mixed in   after that  its not exactly what she said  but how she acted i have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before i ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself which i really dont mind doing  but after she huffed and puffed  i didnt even want to deal with her   the thing is  i was nice the entire time i dont expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either just do what you were hired to do be nice and sell some bras if you come to work in a bad mood  the real world is not going to give you a hug suck it up and do your job or work where you dont have to talk to anyone else ever
i hate this place its very loud  the service is very poor  and the food is so so if you want good chinese in pittsburgh  try china palace shadyside or sesame inn station square or north hills  theyre quieter  with very good food  service
honestly  im furious i enjoyed pf changs restaurants in the chicago area  and my wife and i have eaten a few times at this pittsburgh area location over the last year  we have tried repeatedly  but the 90 120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable we tried going early  late   it never made any difference the front staff was rude  and the wait was too long  tonight  we had a special date planned  and made reservations a week in advance we came in the door exactly on time  waited in the line to see the front staff  and we were promptly handed a pager they couldnt tell us when we would be seated  i imagined a short wait  so we went outside  crossed into a store to wait since the entrance of this location is so packed  its impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating  after 20 minutes we gave up we went back to pf changs and the front office staff still couldnt tell us when we would be seated i saw open tables  what on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?  the food here is good  but certainly not great we went to a local thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes the food was much better  the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant oh  and the local place was a much more reasonable price  we certainly will never visit pf changs again
this was my first time at this pf changs and i was not impressed the service was extremely slow even though it was a sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy the portions were small   they were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud pop music? come on this is an asian bistro
rude unwelcoming short haired black hostess drinks were not good greasy spring  rolls   below par on every way  no experience needed to work here
walked in tonight  wednesday  at 9:50  the place was empty asked for a table  the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us  then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it  the phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door when she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again  didnt say a word to us unbelievable  will not be back there  rude hostess
we went last night saturday night to pfchang located at the kierlands in scottsdale terrible experience after waiting over one hour to be seated  we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side then i ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce  after a long wait my food came so salty that i could not even eat and as much as i hate to complain but i had to let the waiter know  so he went to get me one with less salt my husbands dish was ok then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach i feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat very bad experience our waiter was kind and sympathetic ruined my evening out :
let me start off by saying i have mostly simple tastes  and my favorite lunch spot for chinese has been the new dumpling house in squirrel hill but since that restaurant is undergoing renovations  i was forced to try something new  so i thought id try the chain pf changs chinese restaurant at the waterfront wow  what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be  i started with a cup of their wonton soup at $295 it wasnt too outrageous of a price  the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than i was used to  including three giant basil i think? leafs that covered everything beneath in the broth were chunks of chicken  two shrimp  some sliced water chestnuts and two pork filled wontons as i said  the broth had decent flavor  but the wontons were thick  doughy and under cooked  and the chicken chunks were dry  which is amazing since they were drowned in broth on a scale of bad to good  it was kind of meh  next came my lunch portion order of changs kung pao chicken the dinner portion is $5 more   at the new dumpling house  this dish is served with a delectable dark  rich  tangy sauce  which i was really hoping for not at pf changs   on my plate i received about 8 quarter size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken  7 hot chinese red chili peppers mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce  a handful of blanched  unsalted peanuts  a few sliced scallions  and a bed of the most bland brown rice i have ever encountered uncle ben wouldve been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes  glaringly  there was no sauce none at all  ive had kung pao chicken in new york city  san francisco  and even from a hole in the wall in bethel park  pa that was much  much better never have i had it served in such a bland  skimpy  and overpriced way the lunch portion cost was $995  at the new dumpling house  i could have a delicious lunch  with soup  entree and complimentary hot tea  and i could leave satisfied with just $8 out of pocket   and that includes the tip  the service was decent however  lesson learned one and done never going back to pf changs
the only thing this place has going for itself is the decor the food is very americanized and not true at all of what real chinese good should look or taste like  and the hosthostess think their doing us a favor by seating us
dumb  dumber and dumbest are running the hostess stand they gave me 7 different estimates on the wait time  none of which was accurate john tapper is needed on this property
i went with my family late at night  the food was not good at all   it looked like the left over   i hate it the service was not that professional
we hadnt been at pf changs for awhile and now i remember why the service was terrible the silverware was dirty we waited almost 15 minutes for water glasses to be brought to the table the waiter forget several things we asked for and above all  the food was tasteless and the portion sizes smaller than lunch sized portions we were there before the dinner crowd started so the lack of service or food quality cant be blamed on a busy time dont think we will be going back there
i was a little peeved that the gluten free version of the buddha feast cost $1050 when the regular version cost $950 so youre charging a dollar more to give me the gluten free version of a veggie  tofu  and rice platter?? regardless  its worth it to get the gluten free soy sauce which i buy for myself and i know isnt that expensive when my dish comes out  its literally just steamed veggies and rice no tofu  no seasoning or sauce i ask why theres no tofu and the response is that the tofu has gluten in it when i ask if there should be any sauce aka flavor to the dish im informed i couldve ordered any other gluten free dishs sauce to go along with it thanks for the info nowyes ill take the gf beef broccoli sauce on the side the sauce comes out and its actually tasty so my food was finally interesting enough to eat  even though now im extra annoyed at paying $1050 for steamed veggies and rice and why the menu made no mention that you wouldnt get flavor or tofu  to top it all off based on how miserable i feel now  im pretty sure the beef broccoli sauce they brought out contained gluten anyway so i paid more  got less  and still got gluten in my food??  not a happy customer not going back not going to recommend it to anyone
went there today to have my birthday lunch  it was about 1:45 so the place was not crowded at all got seated not far from the hostess station and sat for close to 15 mins without anyone coming to the table  no water  nothing the table next to us who got seated after us had a server and water by the time we left got up to leave and the hostess said is everything ok i said no  no one ever came overand we went to bravo and had a great lunch i like pf changs in general but if the 2 hostesses watched us sit there for 15 mins i have no idea why they didnt do something i wont be going back here anytime soon
my daughter and i went to panera waterfront  homestead pa around 4 pm on a saturday and tried to order a dozed bagels  we inquired as to when more asiago bagels would be available and the counter person responded with we wont be making more bagels  thats all we have  thinking maybe this was a mistake i tried calling in for a dozen bagels at 3 pm on saturday a couple weeks later and was told the same thing that panera  a neighborhood bakery was out of french toast bagels at 3 pm and wont be making any more  i find it interesting they have many employees standing around i could see if they were busy but they arent busy and items are in the oven baking and with several hours left open for business they easily deny customers product they want to purchase surely it doesnt take very long to bake 6 bagels when given a couple hours  maybe they should not be so concerned about the leftovers being donated instead they should focus on customers reasonable request
non existent internet service   i came here to do some work on my laptop and the internet speed wasnt strong enough  :
stopped by sunday morning the light roast coffee was cold i ordered a steak  egg breakfast sandwich the steak was ice cold the slice of tomato that i had them add was not ripe panera quality should be consistent no matter what location you visit very disappointing considering their pricing structure
